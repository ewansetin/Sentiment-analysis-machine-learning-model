"The service I had from the staff was very good, and waiting times at the fracture clinic were minimal.
The one thing that lets the place down is the parking, its absolutely atrocious. I couldn't park in the car park at all on my last visit, I was forced to park on a side road where I received a parking ticket. If you have to come here use public transport/taxi if you can.",4
"The staff were lovely and I couldn't fault it. Can't blame the hospital they are busy too and we should appreciate the free healthcare. We sit and watch TikTok for hours in our day to day life,  I'm sure we can wait for our own health. Negative was parking and waiting for 8 hours but it is what it is. Thank you Russells for your help 😊",4
"I attended Russell's hall a&e department with heart problems all through the process I was treated with great kindness, and professionalism.
I was admitted and received treatment in the same day treatment, and then transferred to the coronary care ward for further treatment. In both departments I received the upmost care and the staff were exceptional.
With a special mention to the nurse in ae department and Milly the Irish nurse in the same day treatment department.
Also the wards were spotlessly clean, with the staff working hard, to maintain the high standards.
The meals were excellent and very tasty.
My thanks go to all concerned for the superb care I received.
What a credit to the NHS they all are.

"My mom was admitted here,  She cried that one nurse refused to give her, her inhalers, I put a complaint in regarding this nurse. Old blood stained sheets.  Asked for water for mom when we arrived and 3 hours later, she was still waiting. There was so much more but I won't write here. A week after I made the complaint I had a call at 10.13am to say she had taken a turn for the worse. At 10.18am I was told she had JUST passed away. I made a formal  complaint.  In the letter back it stated that she was declared dead at 9.30 which means that when I received the first call, they knew she was already dead. I have my belief into what happened. In the letter, all staff involved had covered for each other.",1
"The 2☆ go to the staff on the MECU who made sure that my best friend was looked after properly during their stay on this ward and to Jason on C7 - these staff made me have faith in the care my friend was receiving - thank you. However, when my friend arrived at A&E they had to wait in a cubicle for 20 hours before they were admitted which is absolutely disgraceful and staff in the A&E were incredibly disrespectful to them. During the almost 10 week stay at Russells Hall, they received no mental health support, and a proper mental health assessment failed to be conducted properly and it was a case of continually passing the book!!!!

When on C7, one member of staff shouted at me for asking a question and bought me to tears as a result of the degree of their intimidation and tone of voice and then assume when they gave me a hug that everything was okay again, when a loved one is in hospital it is not what you expect, to be shouted at by a member of staff and made to feel very distressed!!

This place cannot communicate well at all, the amount of times myself and my friend's partner got asked the same questions because they fail to write things down are unbelievable.

The place that they have then transferred my friend to for further treatment is absolutely diabolical but there wasn't a great deal of choice as they provided no alternative places, so long as they had the bed available that seemed all that mattered in the end.

Thank you to the staff that gave my friend good quality care, but overall as a result of passing the book and a lack of mental health intervention, I do not feel positively about this hospital as I believe my friend's prolonged suffering could have been more easily avoidable, had the relevant teams of people acted like they should have, instead of passing the book onto someone else continuously!!!",2
"A&E is horrendous. I visited three times a week vomiting, losing 5 stone without trying, blacking out to be sent home with anxiety every time and it was all in my head, the next day to collapse and be diagnosed with a fatal disease. If you go do not expect to be able to sit down as no space. Majority of the nurses/receptionist staff look down on you - there is no empathy. Wards are the same - pressed my buzzer for 3 hours with no answer, dragged my Iv drip out to see the nurses plaiting eachothers hair. On the other hand my consultant is brilliant. Shame the rest lets it down.",2
"If I could give this hospital a zero I would. My father was bought under emergency by ambulance 24 hours ago with low heart rate, low oxygen levels  for which he was being given oxygen and stroke symptoms. The stroke team met him on arrival and ordered CT scan, bloods and ecg this was done whilst we were holding outside on the back of ambulance. Seven and half hours on the back of the ambulance before finally going into A&E department. It then took a doctor 12 hours to assess scans to say that more likely had stroke. 24 hours later we are still waiting in a&e for a bed on stroke ward. Absolute joke",1
"I had my first baby at Russell’s hall 3 weeks ago and can honestly say my experience was 5* the care from every midwife I encountered (12 in total during my 40 hour stay) and the midwives with me through the night was flawless. To the doctors who performed my forceps delivery, the anaesthetist’s, everyone was wonderful. There was no wait for anything everything was so efficient and everything went really well for us. Would not have chosen to have my baby anywhere else considering the NHS is at breaking point and there’s a shortage of midwives I didn’t feel for a second my care or my babies care was being neglected and I felt very grateful to have such a lovely experience",5
"My daughter was on day surgery ward on Monday 13th November 2024.
I cannot give enough praise for all the staff that were there but especially Kelly. What a lovely person.
They certainly deserve a pay rise xxx",5
"If its not a textbook problem, don't bother.
111 referred me to urgent care with unexplained sensations in my head. Urgent care said something is going on, you need some further investigation. Told blood tests & CT scan. After a night in A&E waiting room im sent to the Day Care to start all over again! Bloods taken but no results & no CT scan.
More than 13 hours after I arrived at the hospital I'm told to go home because my bloods are OK or not back yet and they haven't got time to do the CT scan because im not ill enough.
NHS no longer have time to investigate, only time to treat the obvious.",1
"I have the honor to work in here for couple of months, it is such a decent hospital, has many hard workers who believes in medicine as a humaine career.

The service is considered excellent compared to other places in the West Midland.

Bless everyone who dedicated their time and efforts ro save someone's else life 🙏💙",4
"I would avoid going to this hospital at all costs, they push severely ill people away and tell them they’re fine. They told a 3 year old girl she was fine and just needed gaviscon. She went to a different hospital and found out it was a tumour in her stomach. This place doesn’t help, it kills",1
"I had to visit the hospital this morning and from the minute I got there until I left which was several hours due to blood tests ECG’s and consultancy and advice I felt I was treated unbelievably well and made to feel so very important ‘ the staff from ANE right through to triage and at the coronary care dept were so kind and considerate I was a bit overwhelmed.
Even the doctors spoke to me with so much respect and explained things so carefully and considerately they were a credit to the hospital and the NHS. Food and refreshments offered and they really couldn’t do enough. I left that hospital feeling humble and so grateful to have been looked after and cared for by so many wonderful individuals.   Thank-you so much",5
"This is aimed at the diabetes department. Its an absolute joke and they couldn't organise a drinking sesh in a brewery. They have completely dismissed the impact diabetes type 1 has had on my mental health. Dr pang the consultant refuses to see me and totally ignored me when I told him I was using alcohol to self medicate. The nurses aren't interested either. One told me that it's me that's the problem and not the diabetes. I have twice been promised an appt with Dr pang since I pleaded with these people for help and this still hasn't materialised. Disgraceful Conduct by this department. I have nothing but resentment towards them. I hope you all rot!
And what a surprise. Not one review on here has been responded too. How caring these scum bags are",1
"Visited with my daughter as it’s the closest hospital to her workplace. They were friendly, very efficient and the staff work very fast. In and out within 1 hour. The parking was easy too. Much better parking than other hospitals we have used closer to home.",5
"Was booked in by my gp to visit the sdec dept. Whole process from start to finish was flawless, staff were very polite and professional. Cannot fault our NHS.",5
"All the people who work and serve at Russell Hall hospital are a credit to their profession.
I cannot speak highly enough of them.
The medical staff mostly do twelve hour shifts and they really care for their patients.
So it's a big thumbs-up from me.",5
Very caring professional staff was my experience in day surgery cardiology today. Im a very bad patient..but they made  me feel so relaxed. And Happy  thank you all so much,5
I have been in Russell Hall hospital as a inpatient and a out patient I have found the staff to be very professional and friendly I really can't speak highly enough of the staff from the medical team right though to the porters anhad cleaning staff I feel very happy for the high quality and standard shown to me,5
"Really poor service, long time waiting (same for different wards), doctors seems to be absent all the time. Last time we were formally apologized by hospital. Lately we came back with same problem - and again, same story of neglection over and over. This place is poorly managed, if it's at all",1
I had a😭 stroke a week ago and the care and treatment received has been truly amazing. They have done everything they possibly can for me. The stroke team on c8 are just 👍👍. They are also very accommodating for my 2 young children to visit. These staff members work tirelessly to ensure we have the best chance of a speedy recovery. I do not know where I would be with out them 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😘😍that includes the catering and cleaning teams all brilliant.,5
"Regarding care at this hospital, it is almost faultless, but it's administration is abysmal. Patients waiting for hours to be discharged, waiting for medications all because of lack of communication. ☹️",2
"My sister suffered horrendous racial abuse by a nurse “Christine Walsall”, told my sister to “go back to where you came from”. Issue has been reported to police and NHS, this issue will not go unresolved, I assure you.",1
"I was an outpaitient yesterday, visiting A&E and SDEC. The treatment I received was exemplary. From the volunteer who pushed the wheelchair for my husband to all the many medical staff who attended me. Thank you all so very much",5
"I went to Russell's Hall hospital 2 weeks ago, had to go to a&e minors cause had a broken wrist that morning at 6pm. The consultant I saw was wonderful and the nurse who helped him. If it hadn't of been for these two lovely people putting me at ease. I don't know what I would of done. They were wonderful.
Yet I had a CT scan done last Friday for something different, couldn't rate them the same. CT scan people I would give two stars.",4
"A&E department is a joke. The receptionist look you up and down like dirt and couldn't care less about their job. Please hire people who care about helping others, it will make a huge difference!!",1
"If you are expecting a baby I would suggest not coming to this hospital! Me and my partner are expecting our first child and through out the pregnancy my partner has experienced quite a lot of pain at different stages throughout and each time we’ve been to the maternity triage it’s been horrible,

We got told at 26 weeks in, that the pains could be pre-term labour and that he could be born in 48 hours, so they gave them some steroids to help him develop, we was then told it wasn’t preterm labour and that she was being kept in because she’s in pain. The next time we went with the same pains they said the exact same thing and kept her in the night, only for them to say the same thing.

It was only until we went to our out of hospital midwife and she did some test did we find out she had a pretty serious water infection, with the amniotic fluid being infected, that they had neglected to test for even though it’s the second mandatory test in the midwives handbook ( our midwife showed my partner for proof) luckily after daily checks from her did the water infection clear.

Then today, we suspected her waters have broken as the symptoms all matched up to it being amniotic fluid and not discharge ect. We was treated so rudely throughout my partner wasn’t asked once how she was feeling or why we are here, they just did some tests and didn’t tell us the results until we was being moved back to the waiting room. When a midwife just said “why you still here” to which we asked about the test results, which were negative, when we asked what is was ,all we got was “ I don’t know what you want me to say”

Absolutely disgusting experience all the way through the pregnancy, my partners needs or requests were not respected and we had students laughing in room whilst quite personal tests was being performed.

Update, they’ve now put us through for a C section after telling us we can give birth naturally, blame us for not booking one earlier, so now they have to do one at a time frame where he and my partner will be put at risk. Thanks Russell’s hall for the disgusting negligence per usual

Place deserves to be shut down and sorted out",1
"I had to go to A&E as I was bitten by a dog whilst out running at Saltwells. Obviously, I wasn't looking forward to it as I thought there might be long waiting times due to the junior doctors strikes. I waited just over hour which was fine as I only had a minor injury. The clinician and the staff I encountered in minor injuries, X-ray and the pharmacy were all fantastic, thorough and helpful. I know that not everybody's experience with the NHS can be good and that can be mainly down to the underfunding and understaffing pressures on the service. But, life would be a lot worse and more expensive without. Just wanted send my thanks for a great service.",5
Visit to A&E today by ambulance with my wife. Experienced the NHS at its best. Amazing care and staff. Pity we are losing it.,5
"My nan went into this hospital to have a drip in
Her hand and 2 days later she did not come out. This is by far the worst hospital ever DO NOT Send your family here for any kind of serious emergency cause they will not be going back home. Absolutely disgusting she was telling the nurses she had pains and the one lady replied aww! Took them 2 days to find she had a clot on her lungs even though they had done blood tests and chests-rays and when one woman had realised something was seriously wrong with her it was to little to late. She was left hours waiting to been seen! Absolutely disgraceful do not understand how you have not been shut down yet the amount of people you let slip in here down to neglect!! you should know to act quickly and not assume people are there for nothing and actual real problems!!!!",1
"Most nurses here are wonderful, kind and attentive. They go the extra mile to make sure you are happy and comfortable during your stay and I thank them so much. However the reason for the 3 stars is for Dr. Choudry while I had Covid and double pneumonia he's denying me oxygen supply. Imagine a doctor saying ""I dont have to give you any oxygen at all"" when you're fighting for your life with Covid and pneumonia. This guy doesnt belong anywhere in the healthcare field, ask to see another doctor if he's assigned to you for your lifes sake. Literally.",3
"Called main reception number just to confirm what department I'd need to arrive at as I'd miss placed my letter they sent so just wanted to confirm with them. Receptionist was very rude when I explained the situation, just said ""Well I ain't got a clue"" in a sharp tone, I then said it's to collect a heart rate monitor. To which she replied ""Well that's cardiology isn't it"" then put me though. The woman at cardiology was actually very helpful and polite so I've given an extra star because of that. Whoever they have on the reception phone definitely needs a training course in manners.",2
"My mom was admitted to this place. Sorry can't call it a hospital because its useless. She only went in with constipation. We got our mom out of this place. Got her home sadly RIP mom after 3 weeks.. they gave my mom wrong treatment,  made her alot worse.",1
I was there with my son last night. It was standing room only and heaving. Everyone we saw were absolutely amazing and looked after my lad so well. One ECG nurse was a little rude to start but soon calmed down and gave a good bedside manner. With the strain in the NHS at the moment and how busy they were I can honestly say our treatment was brilliant.,5
I have been coming to this hospital for 39 years as out patient and in patient. I think over the amount of years I have visited been an in patient and out patient. I have no complaints about my treatment in any department. 10 out of 10 Russells hall.,5
"Simplicity outstanding service with a big 5 stars
I have broken my foot. I was seen and treated within 45 minutes. Simplicity outstanding and thank you Russells hall for a five star service",5
"Hubby was in coronary care. I can honestly say the care he was given was excellent
The ward staff are amazing they went above & beyond in all treatments. Maintained dignity & respect at all times. Anything asked for was sort asap. Thank you for giving me back my husband. It could of been goodbye xx",5
"Hands down the worst most negligent hospital I've ever been to. I urge anyone with family members awaiting treatment for vascular or amputation to transfer to a different hospital. The nursing staff on B3 treated my elderly father horrendously. The ward was filthy, the nurses rude and abusive.",1
I was there to drop a machine that was given to my daughter to monitor her respiratory and I did not stay upto 2minutes there. It was a quick one.,5
What can I say from 999 call to paramedics ED department and then moved AMU and all the other staff and volunteers amazing service from everyone at Russell's Hall hospital thank you from Iris and April keep up the excellent work,5
"Absolutele joke of an hospital, my partner went to the hospital at 2.30pm with my son who is only 18 months old that was finding hard to breath, spent hours in emergency care, before she had to say something to the nurse, because of long it was taking, then was told to go the children's ed, spent hours there only to have obs done and nothing else, in the end we asked staff what is happening, not really given information just told not sure, this hospital is a failure.
My son is back home now has we couldn't wait any longer after being up there nearly 6 hours with nothing done. I hate this hospital and the way it is managed",1
I had a knee op yesterday on ward B21. I can't praise ALL the staff enough. From start to finish I was treated with respect and dignity. If someone called for help a member of staff came straight away and dealt with request straight away. I was regularly asked if I was OK. We were all offered refreshments. All which made for a pleasant relaxing experience. THANKYOU !,5
very appropriate all nurses and staff who working so hard. I understand that you faced tons of people in a day. I speak to one of the lady in urgent centre about my medicine then she has just hang up on me so I rang back right away then one of her team say she gone back home.  Woah this is crazy. Our lives are threatened miss. I wish Karma hits you real hard.,2
"The nurse in the minors who looked after me last week was absolutely brilliant,  it's the same nurse who saw me at Christmas too and she remembered me.
She deserves a massive shout out, sadly I didn't get her name",5
"I’ve been referred by my GP 24 months ago, I am still waiting for my appointment. Meanwhile, my issues became so severe that they withdrew my driving licence… I am 26 year old!
Update: today is Tuesday 22 Aug 2023. It’s been 3 and a half years, I’m still waiting on an appointment, and worse still, when I talk to them they can’t give me an estimate waiting time, or any information about the length of their waiting list. They just tell me I have to wait. I was a happy productive man, living with my girlfriend and trying to set a date for our wedding.
I am now unemployed, moved back in with my dad and limited to applying for jobs that don’t require driving, aren’t miles away from bus stops, and also don’t impose shifts (can arrive to Amazon warehouse in the middle of nowhere for work at 2 am when their shift starts… there are no buses at that time). Being diagnosed didn’t cure me, it just destroyed my life. I wish I never went in for the test 3 years ago.",1
"My husband has just had a knee replacement. His care and treatment from all staff from the cleaners, catering, nurses of all levels and the doctors was exemplary. My husband has an additional problem of being registered blind, they made sure that he was well informed and safe. Can't speak highly enough of them, may the NHS grow and prosper, may these magnificent staff be paid for what they are worth.",5
This hospital murdered my daughter in September last year they let her fit for a hour and half before putting her on a ventilator they starved her brain of oxygen,1
"Shocking. First was discharged from A n E, had to return back to hospital. Had knee op. Was constantly given false information in regard to if i was on operation list or not. Once i had operation i was moved onto ward B2. Nightmare, my buzzer wasnt given to me so had to struggle from bed to go toilet. Only to be told i should of rang buzzer. Well i would if you had given it me. The same night, nurse made a potentially fatal error. I was taken off codeine and put on tramadol. Nurse attempted to issue me with both, only because i tasted the codeine did i spit them out. This is a big No No, you dont mix Opioid based tablets.",1
"Had an elective c-section here (second child). C-section was done one week before due date. My daughter had an underdeveloped liver, but was ok within a few weeks of aftercare. No other complications but felt a little rushed to go home after the operation. There weren't enough hospital beds. Been to the A&E with my oldest daughter and was seen within 3 hours. Overall not a bad hospital but treatment seems a little rushed.",3
"Attended,A E, Not feeling well,I was met by , lovely nurse,who  , immediately , made me feel ,in safe hands Doctors , was on hand ,to take me under their Care , After tests was admitted to Cardiology , was met With a lovely Nurse Explained everything ,to me . After more tests etc, wasn't stressed anymore, My states was,the very best, Treatment,I could have wished for STh could ever had Thank you to all at",5
"After a recent operation and short stay on B1 cannot fault the care.
However, discharge is a joke!
Waited from 10 am until 5 pm for simple paperwork to be discharged. No wonder they are desperate for beds.",4
Thankyou to the day surgery staff who was highly professional team who kept me well informed  .treated me with kindness and respect your a amazing team,5
No one ever answers a phone no matter what time you ring . Unable to get an update on loved ones who have been in the hospital. Surely relatives and friends of patients deserve some respect and reassurance.,2
My wife had our baby at Russell’s hall this year  and her experience was awful . She was told to stay awake all night to watch our sleeping baby and staff were very rude . I have made a complaint . There were a handful of staff that were lovely but she interacted with over 15 members of staff and it was a unpleasant experience which left her scared and calling me in tears not wanting to stay there but she stayed as she didn’t want to leave our baby on his own . I personally when I was visiting my wife as she was there for 1 week heard the staff undermining and speaking down to people . UNACCEPTABLE,1
Went into A and E today as my husband had been referred by 111 to check on possible negative effects of an accidental overdose of prescribed medication.  I expected to wait for hours but my husband was seen and assessed quickly and we were on our way home within 40 minutes.  First class.,5
"90 yo dementia lady in a&e waiting room for 18hours+ in a wheelchair no sleep,little food and drink is not acceptable",1
"I cannot praise Russell's Hall Hospital enought. In the last 6 months they have helped me out and took care of me three times when I could not get an appointment or any action from my GP practice.

The doctors, nursing staff and administrators that I have dealt with have been excellent, very professional and caring and have made sure that my treatment and medication have been properly put in place and managed. I cannot thank you eneough!",5
A&e wait times are a joke .. the waiting room is not big enough .. and you spend more time and money just waiting to be told u need to wait even longer for other things,2
"First like to say, the surgery team are amazing, did a really good job on my ankle, was really polite and ongoing, the trial nurses (work experience via university) staff were brilliant and polite, unfortunately the actually nurses were really rude, and didn’t help very much at all, was moved all around the hospital due to the nurses not knowing what they were supposed to do, very selfish people all around.",3
"Cannot praise staff at AMU highly enough for how they’ve looked after my dad for his last few days. Staff are a real credit to the NHS.
Parking is a nightmare but it’s hard to see what the hospital could do to improve things given the limited space they have",5
"Went for a scan very friendly and helpful nurses. Current road closures on route no fault of the hospital. Russells Hall is a well established hospital.
The lack of investment in all hospitals is apparent, makes one wonder what happens to the excessive car parking charges.
Can not fault the staff they try to make things easier under extremely trying times. The government is failing in many ways at present and previously.",4
"Visited Day surgery unit today for removal of tooth and a root that the dentist couldn't get out under local so had to have a general anaesthetic. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Reception staff, ward staff, and student nurse was great and made me feel comfortable and at ease. The surgeons and the anesthetist came to see me on the ward before and explained everything and the theatre staff and recovery staff were also very caring and helpful.
Thanks you everyone",5
Shocking experience at this hospital with my 85 year old dad - Parkinson’s and a broken hip. So many of the nurses are so amazing and helpful but the one over his ward in B4 is shocking. Leaving him to his own devices. Trying to get him moved.,1
"Very professional care.
I was at ward B5 doctor John and staff were very nice and  professional.
I had a very bad throat infection next day after the treatment and medications I was much better.

A big thank you!!!",5
"NO STARS!! This hospital is the pitts. The staff from the reception upwards are a nasty,, particularly at the Urgent Care Centre. The Drs don't listen to you and are extremely rude and arrogant. There is a message on the tannoy at the UCC warning patients of bad behaviour! It's very annoying to hear this every few minutes. I have been to UCCs in other hospitals and have not heard this insulting announcement! If anyone is rude it's the staff, admin and medical.

The UCC is inefficiently managed. They should have 10 minute slots with each patient and then the wait wouldn't be so long.

All the staff need courses in customer service including the medical staff on how to speak to people with respect.

All the Drs who took a few attempts to pass their medical examinations, must end up RHH. They're all rubbish!! They're the worst I have ever came across.

I told the Dr at the UCC not to prescribe me anything with steroids in, as I am on enough steroid medication to keep me alive and have bad side effects from them.  He completely ignored me and my medical bracelet for a life threatening condition and prescribed steroids.  He wasn't listening. I reacted to the medication and had to go back to RHH UCC the following day. The receptionist was rude and so was the second Dr I saw, who insisted that I CONTINUE to use the medication I had reacted to badly!   I persisted and insisted she prescribe antis which I got.  They should've prescribed antibiotics in the first place.

I didn't like the way both of these Drs spoke to me. My rare health condition was ignored and I get stressed easily because my body doesn't produce the stress hormone. This was not taken into account,  despite me wearing medical bracelet. I felt very vulnerable and accused of bad behaviour, when I was stressed. The staff should try to calm patients down.  If I behaved like RHH staff at my workplace,  I would get sack!

I will never visit the UCC here again.  Been to Dudley Guest, Corbett, Wordsley Hospital (before it shut down) and New Cross which are all fantastic!!  They treat people with respect as opposed to RHH, and there are no annoying tannoy messages warning people about their behaviour. This is insulting and it's tarring people with the same brush. The place needs shutting down. All the staff in there need sacking!! Don't go to RHH for any reason. Also been to QEbham and that's excellent too! Every experience at this RHH has been an atrocious and a shambles. Don't come here!!!  It has a bad reputation locally, when you visit the place you understand why this is the case. I rate it minus three million.",1
"Went to a&e Saturday afternoon with an abscess on my back, I was there for around 4 hours, they got me back in the following morning for surgical removal. I couldn't be happier with the treatment I received. All the staff were super nice & made me feel at ease.",5
"Do I have to choose at least 1 star?! Just abandon all hope at the Urgent Treatment Centre. The staff are rude and very unhelpful, particularly the dark haired lady who wears the dark blue scrubs. When you're reading a letter that states a diagnosis and what I've been sent for and you still tell me ""well we don't know what's wrong with you, do you see what I mean""....you really shouldn't be in a customer facing/paperwork related job! They seem to forget about empathy and customer service and have got way too used to thrusting a form at you to fill in. Communication is shocking bad. What should've been a quick in and out job to collect something turned into a 2 hour wait in a roasting waiting room! I know they're all busy and rushed off their feet so I sat there patiently waiting to be called getting more irritated as the time went by. Turned out that when I was called the lady said she was expecting me to go straight round to them as they'd be given a call earlier to expect me. Fuming doesn't even cover it! No one has a clue what another department is doing. You're endlessly passed around like a lost parcel! No wonder the NHS is broken.",1
"Currently in a life threatening situation and their answer to everything is blood test results was also promised an admission to a psychiatric facility but they didn’t bother to tell me I was just going there to get assessed and a home treatment team would be seeing me, livid",1
"Recently my mum was admitted via A&E where the care was amazing
She later was transferred to AMU 2
Where I can honestly say the care was exemplary. Both professional and kind
An absolute credit to the NHS
Excellent communication with myself and family and always kept updated on progress and plan of care

Many thanks",5
Short staffed which isn't fair on the rest of the nurses/ doctors  they are run off their feet and work very hard  I did have a long wait but I also know that these nurses / doctors are doing their very best to see patients as quickly as possible . A little patience goes a long way .,5
"Amazing response from paramedics today- arrived within minutes for potentially a serious condition. Kind, courteous, professional from all the staff. A massive thank you.",5
I had a really bad experience at Russell hall hospital. This was (adult abuse )and should be raised as a safeguarding case. That's how serious I believe it is .I went in for a day case. Whilst in the admission room got taken to the surgery room . I underwent my producer and brought back to the admission room where patients recover .I was  just left in server pain for serval hours suffering in the worst pain you could imagine for 7 hours.  I was sick and unable to keep down the pain medication the nurse gave me orally. .The nurse tried several times to call the doctor back to review my condition he would not come she called him so many times  but it was in vain. Just imagine suffering the worst pain ever.  This paitent sitting in front of me had to call staff for help and assist me I was sick and my grown had blood all over it and my stomach was in so much pain.  The nures called  the doctor on the phone who eventually arrived around 6sh.  He put pain killer medication in my tube in my cannula  just walk away. I heard the nurse say to the doctor she cannot be discharged home like that. The doctor told her to hurry up and transfer me to B1 ward . He put so much pain killer in my system it knocked me out. I couldn't ever speak to my son and his girlfriend when they visited me they had to come later in the evening because of time it took to attend to my health condition. I believe doctor to be caring but not in this case . It is a safeguarding I soon realized I will be calling and making a compliant.,1
Had to visit the paediatrics ED and have an x-ray. All of the nurses and doctors were attentive and well mannered. Very professional and we were out in 2 hours. Thank you for the team that cared for my lad.,5
"Went this morning to see consultant  re a possible  skin problem  on my face,  consultant  excellent. Then had MRSA test and photos taken. Everyone  was brilliant. All done and out in 45 mins
Thank you
M.T.",5
"Came in with high BP 206 , high heart rate , risen temp , was supposed to go to A&E department ended up waiting 7 hours to be seen,  2 kids with me , 1 GP for the whole of the urgent walk in center was initially triaged and told I was an emergency and needed to be seen asap, ECG showed abnormalities but here I sit still waiting to be seen, can't be that much of a priority reception didn't help much didn't seem to care and just said if you get worse let us know which I did do and nothing changed",1
"Terrible place that almost killed me, treated for stroke for 3 weeks whilst having seizures  and one night I was double dosed whilst I was sleeping. I was transferred to QE who said my liver was screaming as I was given wrong drugs and this is what caused the damage. I was diagnosed with epilepsy at QE after spending 7 weeks in hospital. I'm out now but staff, catering staff and cleaners where rude and not even bothered. I had 7 seizures here and had lock jaw from all the stress where at QU I only had 1. I feel I would had better treatment at PDSA than here.",1
"The C2 ward is awful!
Took my 3 month old out in the middle off night in a different room without telling me.. she had no name tag on her for 4 days!
They wanted me to leave my 3 month old In a car chair at the entrance by her self!
Getting all the information about my daughter wrong! Didn’t even tell me she was on medication !!!
Awful! Don’t trust my child there ! Communication is awful!",1
"Chaos & incompetents. Say one thing then do another. My partner, Waited all day for pain relief. Waiting 9 hours for medication so could be discharged. Patient next to me was in agony waiting for pain relief.  Doctors who can't speak proper English. Staff with tattoos etc on display, looks unprofessional. I would rather perform surgery on myself with a knife & fork, than let these idiots anywhere near me. What were people clapping for again?",1
"I received amazing care from this hospital and the SDEC Unit. However, I witnessed the most horrific behave from one gentlemen who constantly threatened staff over a 7 hours period and wasn't removed!! I commend the staff for what they had to put up with and the hospital needs to do lore to protect them.",5
"On Sunday 10th July, I turned up at A&E at 4pm, with Covid complications, high fever and extreme pain in my right Sinus and head.  I was drenched in sweat and became hysterical when I saw the 4 hour waiting time.

The Nurse saw me immediately, he was amazing, so calm, lovely, mindful and took my blood pressure, I was taken in for an ECG and seen by another lovely Nurse and a ward GP.

A senior nurse immediately assessed my ECG and symptoms,  she was incredibly calm and very thorough.

I cannot thank the amazing staff on Sunday enough, it was boiling hot weather, you didn't have any air conditioning, yet you soldiered on and helped.  xx",5
"Went to walk in centre for prescription for antibiotics to treat infection on leg. Expected to wait for a long time as was quite busy, but was seen in under one hour and treated by extremely pleasant and professional staff. I cannot praise the service and staff enough! Excellent facility with service by lovely nurses and office staff.",5
"Had a skin lesion removed on Wednesday. 4 health care professionals in the room,all very pleasant and put me at ease. Can not fault my experience.thank you all",5
"I would like to say a MASSIVE! thank you to all the staff in the SDEC Unit. from the ladies taking details, the ladies giving blood, the consultants. I was made so welcome, treated like I was the most important person in the world and they did this with everyone.
Everyone was so well looked aftered, because our waiting times were so long food was handed out with tea and coffee. Well done everyone and thank you. You are all angels.",5
Fantastic Hospital. All staff are friendly and made me feel welcome.,5
"Went in for an operation last Sunday, on a hernia that I was diagnosed with 2 years ago, what with covid and hospitals trying to play catch up i do understand, the wait.
Got to the hospital at 7.15 was made welcome on ward b1. Shown to my bed and left to relax, nurses and doctors came in done tests and gave me all the info I needed before the operation, staff new how nervous I was and helped me to feel calm, went to theatre in the afternoon wasbso nervous, the anesthetist got me to chill on bed and done all the needles before I could think about it just brilliant, the staff in the theatre and on the ward top rated.
Thank you all",5
"8/3/22.Took relative with abnormal heart beat to minors ED at 6pm. Although busy, were first seen within the hour. There were coffee stains on the floor and rubbish left on seats. Tests needed to be repeated and we ended up being there for 10 hours, the majority of which was spent on an upright chair in the waiting room. During the whole 10 hours, the spilt coffee and rubbish on chairs remained there. The only toilet in working order was not cleaned either. Two other patients with sickness were left in the waiting room vomiting in public. Ham sandwiches were offered to everyone including the Muslim families, please be sensitive! We saw a doctor who thoroughly went through my relative’s symptoms. By 4am, she had gone home and we had to repeat it all over again for a new doctor. She couldn’t find a quiet space to discuss her findings, so she took us through to majors and showed us into a cubicle. This hadn’t been cleaned after the previous patient and there were clear boot prints on the sheet. Finally just after 4am it was suggested that my relative went home and returned for clinic at 8am the same morning!
General view, medical personnel were friendly and explained everything asked. They were very over worked. Hospital premises in ED minors was dirty and not cleaned for over 10 hours.
10/3/22 Same relative went to out patient clinic. Very different experience. Much cleaner and comfortable chairs for the 7 hour experience. Out patients clinic would receive 4.5 stars.
13/3/22 came back into A and E and was transferred firstly to resus and then to Cardiac care . Both excellent. Julie in Cardiac day care was excellent and helpful. This visit much better 5 stars.",2
"I'm in hospital at the moment with a rare case of meningitis which has caused many problems including 2 bleeds on the brain.
I would give this hospital 5 stars because the doctors and the nursing staff have been second to none.
I have been told under no circumstances to get myself worked up or stressed in Amy way because another episode could kill me.
So......
In their world of wisdom the consultants who I must say let this whole place down due to them thinking that they are God and can Do no wrong put a dementia patient in the bed next to me.
As you can imagine I have had very little sleep in a week.
Obviously it's not the patient to blame as he has no concept of reality so life to him is totally normal.
The girls and boys work their hearts out and do their best but most of the time are banging their heads against the nearest wall.
Surely it's about time the trust looked at these decision makers who earn massive salaries and made some drastic changes.
Forgot to mention....
A consultant who can't be named was going to send me home because he wasn't even looking at the right scam.
REALLY????.
GOD HELP THE STAFF.
Yours.
Richard Jackson",2
Russells hall has saved my wifes life  twice. Once when she had bacterial meningitis then 7 years later with bowel cancer  . Can't praise them enough on both occasions,5
My mom was on ward c7 Station 2 an the nurse I always spoke to with any issues or concerns was more than helpful with solving any concerns or issue as soon as possible nurse bola was an amazing thoughtful an amazing nurse all the time,5
"Gave birth to my daughter here August 2022, student midwives everywhere - they were nice & friendly though. Was in labour for over a week & they kept telling me conflicting things (one Midwife said I was in slow labour then others were saying I wasn't in labour?) While being started off was just left to my own devices while in pain, I kept telling the midwives & they just kept giving me paracetamol & codeine - something didn't feel right, finally got moved to the delivery ward on my own, was having really bad pain in my lower abdomen (right side) I kept telling them I can't lie on that side as it's really hurting but was told to stay on that side because my daughter's heart rate kept dipping, was in ""active labour"" for a whole day with no progress - then I ended up having a epidural about 3 times which didn't work (was told after they injected me that they were both trainees) bearing in mind I already have 2 prolapsed discs in my lower back then after all that I ended up having an emergency caesarean by spinal block, then straight after I gave birth my delivery partner was told to go home - I felt so alone & couldn't even get anything out of my suitcase or reach for my daughter when she was crying. I can't believe that they've got trainees injecting people's spines! One slip of a needle I could've been paralyzed! Shocking!",1
"Had my baby at the midwife led unit and had to stay two nights on the ward after. I have to thank the nurses and doctors who helped me through the labour and postnatal care. Even after having to go back into hospital due to being unwell, I was taken care of and the midwifes and nurses were absolutely amazing! The only downfall is they don’t have facilities for your partner to stay and that I found difficult but they said it’s a hospital policy. It’s a shame because my brother was allowed to stay when his son was born a couple of years ago.

Overall I’d say I’ve had outstanding care and I highly recommend the maternity ward! They listened to me and respected my wishes when I refused to be induced and allowed me to stay in the midwife led unit even though I had become ‘high risk’ they monitored me regularly as recommended by the doctors on duty and kept me at ease. There were a couple of midwives that put me at ease on duty on the 5th, I wish I knew their names! There was another midwife that watched my baby whilst I had some sleep, I can’t remember her name (I think it’s Gemma) but she was lovely and I can’t thank her enough.

Whenever I needed anyone I just had to click the buzzer and they came soon after and helped me with whatever I needed. They were all polite and showed interest and genuinely happy to help.

I was out of it but I hope to go back to thank them soon xx",5
They never tell you what's happening and it's still the same. I had to demand that the nurse tell my brother he had a Stroke,1
Honestly if you're on deaths door and they want to bring you to Russell's Hall just go straight to the funeral home. Easily one of the worst NHS hospitals around. I've been in and out of this hospital since the age of 10 (now 26) and every time I enter this place is gets worse and worse. Doctors openly admit if they don't know what's wrong with the patient.. they blame the patient. They ignore the advice of GP's and do what they think is best. They make appointments for people without telling them when it is. A&E staff refuse to care for mental health issues. Crisis team would rather call security and police on you when having a mental breakdown. Whoever is in control of the car park have no professionalism at all. Honestly I'd go to a different hospital. You might not come out of this one.,1
"I can only thank the wonderful people who were involved in my care. Having arrived by ambulance, I was rapidly escalated through the hospital system and was admitted to intensive care with a pulmonary embolism (a big one apparently).
I was treated with kindness and compassion by a multitude of people who didn't know me from Adam. From the doctor in charge of ITU to the staff diligently cleaning anything and everything to keep us safe...
I cursed, ranted, cried and laughed with the nurses who got me back on my feet and well enough to return home, to each and all , all I can say is ""thank you"". I arrived broken and scared and left back in one piece.",5
"The care & treatment I received before & after my operation recently was outstanding. The friendliness & professionalism of ALL the staff was amazing. The compassion & sensitivity that was shown to me was heart warming.  The staff do an absolutely amazing job, really cannot praise them enough. A huge Thank you to ALL from Day Case Unit,  to ALL in Theatre's (Plastic surgery team) to ALL on B4. You ALL do an amazing job!! Thanks again ❤",5
"Thank you everyone who looked after me for the 2 days I stayed so close to Christmas!

I would mostly like to give my gratitudes to Kieran in Day Surgery for being so reassuring and friendly before going under and a massive thank you for Nurse Charles in the East B1 ward for being so personable and helpful for in my time of support.

Some staff there felt like it was just a job to tick a box and leave the room, but Charles took the time to have a quick chat about things happening in his or my life, do his checks and make sure you’re comfy.

The reason why I rated 4 instead of 5 is due to the lack of communication in the discharge process. I would have presumed my emergency contact would have been notified about my discharge, but with the the lack of any signal I couldn’t call her till I was out of the hospital and she then had to make a 45 minute drive to collect me while I wait in the cafeteria… not the best feeling after having a serious surgical procedure.

The food was great also. 😊",4
The staff are wonderful and that means all the staff...worth their wait in gold,5
"The care & treatment I received before & after my operation recently was excellent.

The friendliness & professionalism of ALL the staff I had seen to me was amazing and the compassion & sensitivity that was shown to me was heart warming.

The staff did a brilliant job so a huge Thank you to ALL from Day Case Unit, to ALL in Theatre (Mrs Meer’s team).

You ALL do an amazing job!! Thanks again.
Would recommend this hospital for outpatient Day Care.",5
I called 111 with terrible back pain caused from a complication of Covid. They got an ambulance to send me to the Covid place and then from there went to a Covid ward for the night. Every staff member who treated me was absolutely lovely. They treated my pain quickly and I was treated so well throughout my whole stay. The staff were so attentive and I’ve never felt so looked after at a hospital. The nurses are absolutely lovely at Russell’s hall. They don’t just ask if you’re okay but they will have a little chat with you and make you feel really welcomed. I felt so much better after my stay there and cannot thank the staff enough for the way I was treated. The doctors that looked into my pain were thorough and looked into everything so nothing was left not looked at. Thank you so much to all the staff at Russell’s hall. When I went in my heart rate was 160 and by the time I had left it was a completely healthy 94. I cannot remember the ward I was on I think it was C5 or something but the head doctor was Anthony and all his nursing staff were just amazing. The other place I was before this which was the initial place they put the Covid patients were also hugely caring and compassionate and I couldn’t have asked for better care. Thank you all so much for getting me better.,5
"I had a call from i believe from booking dep lady initials are CH from this hospital. CH was very brutal, did not listen one word what i was trying to tell her! Was talking over to me all the time didnt stop once only when I asked can i speak to somebody else, luckily another lady was ok and could have conversation. These kind of people CH  must not work in health care system. I will write complains too once i have a bit of time.
That experience was awful !!!",1
"I am currently having eye injections for Wet Macula @ both Russell Hall & Corbett Hospitals. I cannot thank you enough for your kind, professional, and understanding @ both hospitals. This includes the receptionist to the doctor Mr Yousuf & everyone in between.
Care doesn’t come any better than this.",5
"Where to start..
A and E is a nightmare for both patients and staff. Security have to put up with idiots with self inflicted problems as do the nursing staff and Doctors.

On the other hand, the staff in the wards are absolutely run ragged, yet they keep their self respect and still treat abusive patients with respect and manners.
This hospital copes with a massive workload, and copes with it very well.
My disabled daughter was treated in here for a week, and I never came across a stroppy or angry member of staff.
They have my total respect, as do the porters, cleaners, ambulance staff, and volunteers.
Five star effort, five star people.",5
"My dad was admitted to this hospital 8 nights ago. Although visiting was not permitted (understandably) due to covid. I was able to call up daily for an update. Every nurse/doctor or receptionist I spoke to was polite, informative and took the time to explain exactly what was going on. Thank you to the staff for looking after my dad in his time of need and for being so patient, understanding and proactive. ❤️😊",5
"Don't deserve any stars. My son is currently fighting for his life. After you guys did not check his feeding was right after we told you guys we were concerned. You still discharged and my baby is poorly with a heart problem and has had to have surgery. Was messed about with being induced, a woman rang up and said he needed another scan on his thema wether we liked it or now he had dwarfism even tho they did not have any facts to say that. He wasn't even born yet. Russells hall are an absolute joke same with the maternity side and the consultants. But I know my son is in good hands in Birmingham children's Hospital.",1
"Can't praise the staff highly enough,after I attended Russells Hall recently for surgery.The service I received was exemplary and all the staff I encountered were very helpful, caring and really took care of me.Thankyou!",5
"I had my day surgery yesterday at Russell's hall hospital.

The staff were so lovely and looked after me. I have had encounters with other hospitals via family but never experienced any staff as friendly as here.

Thank you to Dr Voynov for seeing me and fitting me in and to all the nurses that looked after me post recovery

God bless you",5
"Having never been to this hospital before I was overjoyed with the level of care my wife received from Mr Pathak and all the doctors nurses and associate non clinical staff on B3 we met.
My wife went from examination to emergency bypass surgery in 4 days which without a doubt saved both her legs from amputation.
The 3 weeks she spent in this hospital was made easier by everyone that looked after both of us,
Should anyone unfortunate to need the services of these wonderful staff be rest assured you are in safe hands and my wife and myself will always be eternally grateful for you vocational choice in this field of care. God bless you all.
Mr,Mrs Hackford",5
"I wish to extend my thanks to all the nurses in Wards C5 and B6, particularly the latter as I spent most of my time there during my kidney stone treatment. As I was probably the least afflicted, I could observe the way they treated patients with dignity, professionalism and kindness. How they managed to maintain a smiley attitude, I'll never know when faced with some very old men who could barely understand what was going on. I doubt whether one could find a better nursing team anywhere in the world. Love to you all from my wife and myself  especially Becca, who  never seemed phased and was at the beck and call of patients and nurses alike.",5
"Went to the fracture clinic yesterday and a lovely lady Angie was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. After a bad few weeks up there this experience was great and definitely a credit to the hospital. So polite, friendly and welcoming.",5
"I had never visited this hospital before, I was referred to B5 - Emergency Surgical Hub yesterday. Each single staff member there was very well mannered! I didn’t feel as though I had met them for the first time. Extremely caring and generous, it makes you feel that much better with happy faces around you. Wishing them all the very best!",5
"Well just managed to book an appointment with my renal doctor, the hospital couldn't be bothered to book me one again. This is the last time. I wont be chasing them again to see anyone, lost all faith in the whole fecking shambles.",1
"I recently attended A and E at Russells Hall Hospital as I had trodden on broken glass which resulted in excruciating pain and which developed into Cellulitis.
I cannot praise enough the treatment I received from all I came into contact with. Dr Peter Ahee was welcoming in manner, learned and professional. The follow up appointment by Dr Aflac Fazal was efficient and smooth running.
In particular I would like to praise Sarah Fieldhouse-Coates  Snr Nurse Practitioner, who couldn’t do enough to help and whose friendly manner put everyone at their ease. She was on the ball with every question the doctors asked.  A credit to the Department.
Thank you everyone.",4
"My dad got admitted here due to collapsing at home and I really wish we could of had some sort of input as to where he was taken but as Russell’s hall was the nearest that’s where he went.
After a long wait in a&e we were told to wait in a relative room whilst he went for a ct scan, at this point he had already suffered two heart attacks due to fighting a septic shock and pneumonia, he was then taken to critical care. This is where myself and mom sister and brother experienced the most traumatic time of our lives! We were told he was really ill but a few days later he was slowly taken off his medication but still on the life support if he needed it. The nurses constantly lied, one nurse would say he’s making progress and the other would say he’s not so great. They were aware of a blockage in his bowel when he first got admitted however 10 gruelling days later due to having another septic shock which they knew was approaching they decided the only chance was to open him up. His small intestine was completely dead and part of his bowel had died too so at that point we were told to say goodbye to our hero.
This was the worst time of our lives yet no one cared, he was just a number who was taking up a bed that they wanted, after being told they would turn his life support off gradually throughout the night we left in disbelief but went home and within an hour of getting home they called to tell us he’d passed away so no soon as we had left the building they switched his machine off!
My advice to anyone reading this is...if you have a relative a loved one or anything like that please do not send them here if you want to see them survive.
Nicola a nurse in critical care was amazing as was Justine, the rest were hopeless and didn’t have a clue what they were doing.
My dad was 63 he should be here but due to a number of staff who couldn’t arrange a piss up in a brewery he has now gone forever",1
"Car parking is a nightmare. I’ve visited various times recently during the day and each time I’ve been forced to drive in circles around the car park hoping that someone will pull out of a space. The hospital says you get 15 minutes free parking. Trust me, this won’t happen as by the time you get your ticket, enter the car park, find a space and get into reception- the 15 minutes will have elapsed",1
"ED Minor injuries were brilliant with my Mum today after she had a repeated fall on a weakened ankle, I think the gentleman who saw to her was called Andrew? He really made her feel comfortable when she has severe anxiety with hospital visits, thankyou 🥰
Was a bit of a battle to find her a wheelchair when entering the ED to book her in, but they were especially busy.",4
"My son was recently admitted to this hospital.
When i visited him i found the hospital was really light, airy and immaculately clean.
Everybody was very friendly and helpful.
I would like to especially thank the Doctor's, Nurse's and all of the staff on ward C1 for being so calm, caring and attentive to him and so helpful to me.
I have nothing but praise for them all and the hospital in general.",5
"I have nothing but praise for how well I've been looked after at this hospital,  from the communication by the general surgery secretarial team to check in at day surgery,  nurses on the ward anaesthetist, surgery team and recovery nurses. Thank you for being so attentive and caring ❤",5
"Have had so many bad experiences of this hospital this year. My husband has unfortunately had 4 in patient stays & each time their have been issues. He is unable to do anything for himself & now has vascular dementia. This time they kept him in nearly 3 weeks despite him being medically fit to come home after just over a week. He then refused to eat, drink or let them do personal care. When I finally got him home he was in a terrible state. His insulin had been changed, he was dehydrated, couldn't speak & his sugar & ketone levels were dangerously high. Had to call 111 who sent out paramedics who wanted him to be taken back in but he refused. After several days at home he was eating, drinking & talking again. I'm certain if he'd remained there or gone back in, I'd be a widow by now. Why on earth when someone is fit to come home do they keep them in & watch them slowly dying in front of their eyes.",1
"Worst Hospital. I was admitted there for 1 week for abdomen pain; 1 they have not diagnosed the reason for my pain. 2 they've discharged me from the hospital whilst still having severe pains. 3 all the note the nurses have written are incorrect. The last 3-4 days that I was there I had been vomiting everything that I ate and all the nurses have written in their notes ""nil vomiting"". 4 the last 2 days that I was there my pains were severe to the point I could not move on my own however the nurses have written I was independent and self caring. 5 my last night at the hospital I had an anxiety attack at midnight in my bed and the nurse has written I'm all fine.
Never going to this hospital again I would rather suffer on a journey to a further hospital than going here.
All the nurses lie and the doctor goes with the fake notes and then you are not treated correctly.",1
Unfortunately I was referred for heart pains & collapsing - streaming nurse “JGM” at the desk gave me a form to fill in and then even though my problem/injury was on there. Continued to rudely ask me to explain my issue out loud and keep repeating it along side mental health/personal questions with a line of people looking at me. Receptionists was rude and abrupt and cut me off at every chance they could - this Is my local hospital but will travel to Queen Elizabeth just for the treatment of patients to be better.,1
Go triage in an ultrasound First tell me something was wrong on the ultrasound then told me differently that the ultrasound was normal first impressions staff seemed really polite last impression seems like staff didn’t know what they were talking about running round like headless chickens would definitely not recommend i’d rather just sit at home in pain I have no faith in the nhs,1
Absolutely diabolical when in a/n Nov 13 happened to me be my birthday went in with kidney stones problem's in absolutely in agony kept waiting for hours to get pain relief treated like a dog I was quite upset and kept asking for help the help I got was from security staff please do your self a favor and give this so called hospital a very wide berth should. Have a/ e closed down peoples lives are in danger,1
"Dire.Went in for hernia repair,surgical staff were very good,but the nursing staff quite obviously didn't want to be there.When I arrived and was taken by the ambulance driver to the dept. on my letter no_one knew where to send me,3 tries later she just had to give up and leave me to their mercy.Eventually put into room and robed up for theater but after an hour told I would have to move.I was then sent to area 1,which is an eye dept.Was then sat in a corner on a kitchen chair,in theater robe with a mixed sex crowd waiting on eye procedures.3 hours later was taken into theater and had op.On recovery in ward was left to my own devices .Not  offered painkillers,had to request them.Left in blood soaked robe until discharged.Without a doubt the worst hospital I have ever been in.",1
"This review is only towards the children's ward as I have had many bad experiences in other wards but the children's ward was great, clean, helpful, there was activities for my child to do when ever he was being crazy and asking questions they had all the patience in the world, I saw the same pedeatrican a few times and he is fabulous, he really tries to explain things the best he can and he does it with with smile on his face. So fab experience yesterday ..",4
Just spent 5 1/2 hrs in A&E. The doctors were brilliant and the treatment excellent. My only disappointment was at admissions the nurse made my husband think he shouldn’t really have been there and twice said he would have to wait at least 4 hrs and the wait was getting longer!! I know people go to A&E when they don’t always need to but please don’t judge everyone the same. Something that seems simple can be quite serious as was my husbands case.,4
I was admitted to hospital  for 24 hpurs i had fanstic care throughout food good hospital was spotless  care  10 out 10,5
"What can I say about this hospital, so far they have.
Delivered both my kids.
Operated on me.
Went to walk in numerous times.
Took my kids in when they were poorly.
Trusted the care of family to them,
And everytime they have done a unbelievable job, staff are great serious but can also have a laugh, even the housekeeping team is great. Doctors and nurses all care about patient welfare and safety and let's face it without them covid would have been so much worse in the area.
I have nothing but respect towards the NHS and the morals they have as well is appreciate we have the NHS to help us when we urgently need them.
Thank you for your hard work, long hours and the high pressure and stressful job you do. Without you guys and ladies we would be in a dire place within our society and nation",5
"I have my own negative experiences being 'treated', but the current problem now is no one in the hospital can locate my mother brought in for emergency surgery at 4:30am over 12 hours ago. Bouncing from one department to the next, no one knows where she is. Shambles.",1
absolute rubbish service 3 departments refusing to see a child and no reason given. not enough doctors working when they need to be u cant tell us that 1 doctor is enough to run a whole department if you had more working then you're wait times would be lower and you wouldn't be getting poor scores on here would you,1
"Efficient, caring, well-staffed, clean and well-equipped the staff kept us well informed and we were in and out of the hospital in just four hours, having seen probably four nurses and two doctors in that short space of time, with us rarely being alone for more than a few minutes.

Compare and contrast this with Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, where for the exact same problem we saw two members of staff in total and were kept in a ward that was meant for elderly patients for thirteen hours before finally being released.

I am very glad that this is now my local hospital.",5
We attended the Imaging department at Russels Hall and Mohamed and Emily were amazing. There care and service helped my son cope with a scary situation for an Autistic man. Excellent care knowledge and service from a very professional team. Many thanks guys.,5
"My stepdad as dementia,and as been in the hospital since Wednesday.  He is very dehydrated as he's drank very little . why are these doctors and nurses not putting on a drip ? Its been 4 days with little or no fluids . I've ask nurse to put note on records for the doctor,and she hung up on me . How about if it was their own family members. They need to learn some manners and understanding.  Ward  b2",1
"Been in twice in last seven days. The service when you get into a ward, away from the unbelievably busy but coping A&E dept, is nearly as good as private.’ I was in acute medical and every type of nurse, staff and doctor that cared for me were excellent. Food has been much better than an op five years ago as well.",5
They did a great job looking after my wife after she had an issue with her gall bladder. Very helpful and friendly staff.,4
A and E absolute shambles - some departments are good but today was awful. A doctor didn’t want to see my wife because she was female and apparently didn’t feel comfortable … they have no clue in those areas,1
"My mother was recently diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. As soon as she was diagnosed she received wonderful service and care from the nurses, Dr’s and the Consultant Professor Stonelake. Our family would like to publicly thank them all for everything they have done, and the speed with which they responded especially during this covid-19 pandemic. Thank you all and thank you the NHS.",5
"I have been under the ENT dept since March and I am so impressed with their help, advice and patience.  They have gone above and beyond to help me.  I work in a hospital and to get that kind of treatment in these days is rare.  I am so grateful happy and impressed.  To all the staff consultants and the juniors you have all been so kind and helpful.  Thank you a million times.  Hannah",5
"Of course my son had to be ill on the busiest day of the year so far. When I arrived at a very full A&E I was told there was a 4-7 hour wait with 118 people in front of me. It was only about 10.30am. However my asthmatic son had low oxygen saturation due to a chest infection and we got to see a doctor within 20 minutes. He was xrayed and admitted onto C2 children’s ward very quickly, and I am very grateful for the treatment he received. Yes they were busy, yes they were understaffed, and yes admittedly not everything on the ward ran like clockwork, nor were there enough nurses per patient, but my son’s care was still good and the nurses were caring and lovely, and the doctors were friendly and approachable. Thankfully he is on the mend, and I am grateful to the lovely NHS staff that helped him get better. Thank you.",5
Ridiculous waiting times.. And if someone is Covid possative they will sit them within 2 meters of you even though they had a cubicle for that person it wasn't used for that as a patient with baby in a pram was sitting in it due to lack of seating in the waiting room. Well that's what the app said after a 5 hour wait.  Very unorganised place to be definitely QE for me next time.,2
"Unfortunately my mom, Annette Jones was taken to hospital yesterday ( Sun 31st May) following a bleed on the brain & unfortunately she died while in Resus.  I'd like to thank all of the staff who dealt with my mom's care, nurses, doctors & consultants all of you were so caring & professional to both my mom & her family. I appreciate everything that you did for my mom even when it was obvious nothing was going to help her. I am eternally grateful for your kindness shown to her and her family  in her  final moments.Thank you all so much x",5
"My experience there for three days was dismal. Had a bad fall and sustained a fracture in my spine. The paramedics were amazing from the moment they came to my house and stayed with me at the hospital until i was handed over to the nursing team on the B5 ward I am deaf and have a physical disability, there was no deaf awareness at all apart from the one lovely csw who served me meals. The nurses' attitude was awful and I was made to feel like a nuisance with a couple of nurses along with some of the auxiliary staff sighing and rolling their eyes upwards. They kept getting their facts wrong along with the medication. My dad who at the age of 88 had to come in and advocate for me which shouldn't have been necessary if they were more caring, understanding and knowledgeable. This was a shocking experience to say the least. Have stayed at the QE hospital in Birmingham and they were amazing.",1
"Terrible Terrible. Mother in Law, 92 years old, admitted yesterday with a broken shoulder. Tried for over 2 hours today to find out where and how she is. Kept being passed from one section to another. One person admitted that they didnt have an admissions clerk to check!!! Finally got to speak with someone who could help. This ""Hospital"" is a joke. The management needs sacking and their inflated salaries diverted to front line staff.",1
A&E is a nightmare. One doctor for an instreaming flood of patients all in need to see a doctor. Official waiting time escalated to 9 hours...I was in pain and in need of a doctor after 6 hours I left without ever seeing a doctor. I hope my situation will be bearable for few hours more at home and tomorrow I m forced to go to another hospital. At Russell Hall I asked 3 times how much longer but no hope could be given . I cannot blame the staff they try their best. The system is broken and this hospital mismanaged. This is not human.Its like a warzone.,1
"Was admitted early March 2020 with Sepsis, Ambulance crew were Brill and so were everyone else until I was taken on to ward, myself and another patient made an official complaint to Matron. My daughter when visiting had to clean toilet that had been in a dirty state for over 2 hours.",3
"Terrible service. If you can go somewhere else - do.
My mother in law came here after staying in the area, she thought she had fractured her arm, they took radiographs and told her she was fine she had just bruised it. My mother in law being an highly educated heath care professional waited a week and went to a different hospital - lo and behold she had a hair line fracture.
Recently I have been very Ill. I honestly still thought this hospital couldnt be that bad. Was told by the nurse my symptoms were caused by anxiety-despite begging her for help, I told her I was sure I had a chest infection and I couldnt breath properly she said the consultant on the ward would not see me - come back if you get worse.
She made me feel crazy especially scince my head was not working due to an infection.
Thank God I managed to see my own GP (she saved my life).
I really would not reccomend this hospital.
The cross infection control is terrifying.
Needs to be shut down and reopened under new management with new staff.",1
"My aunt was discharged home from the Russells Hall Hospital on the 2nd August. The physio (Isabelle) told me on the 1st August that my aunt's mobility was too good for rehab and that she could return home. The previous 4 days, the same physio repeatedly told me my aunt would have to go to rehab so I was confused by the sudden change in the physios attitude. Especially as my aunt seemed muddled on the 1st August. The physio and I had even discussed places my aunt could go to.

The physio said my aunt was back to her baseline with her walking. Since my aunt returned home she has struggled to walk. She is not at her baseline at all and is now requiring commodes with wheels on so the carers can get her from a to b. This is something the physio did not assess her for because I had to request these commodes from social services myself after my aunt was discharged.

The physio mentioned a social services carers package however she only gave me a few minutes to make a decision on this. She said she needed an answer there and then. I do not think its right to pressurise people into making such important decisions in the space of a few minutes especially as my aunt was muddled and half asleep. I told the physio my aunt was muddled too.

At one point the B1 ward had my aunt using the incorrect zimmer frame as she was meant to be using the one with wheels on and they had her walking with the one that didn't have wheels on. When I told the nurse about this, she said my aunt was using the correct frame. I had to wait to see Isabelle to tell her about this. Isabelle said I was correct and added the wheels to the frame. This made me wonder how well she actually was assessed by the team.

6 weeks later and my aunt can no longer walk and can just about transfer from the chair to the commode.

I also had issues with the hospital pharmacy. When my aunt was discharged, they sent her home with boxes of medication. The pharmacy wrote on the medication sheet that my aunt doesn't have a compliance aid. What they didn't realise is that my aunt suffers with macular degeneration and has to use a carousel to dispense her medication as she can't see the writing on the boxes of medication. Why did the pharmacy not contact myself or my aunt's pharmacy for clarification on this? I spoke to my aunt's pharmacy and they said no one asked them! This is disgusting. My aunt is 97 so did they not think to check her living situation?

The pharmacy also made the assumption that my aunt had regular medication at home so they didn't send her home with all of her prescribed medication either. My aunt did have some of her regular medication at home but how could they assume this without contacting anyone? And because changes were made to my aunt's prescribed medications whilst she was in hospital, I had to go through my aunt's carousel and take out 4 tablets for each day which my aunt couldn't do herself. I am not a pharmacist and this should not have been down to me. My aunt luckily had me to help her otherwise she would have been taking the wrong medication each day. This was a dangerous mistake to make as her blood pressure lowered in hospital and if she had taken those 4 tablets by mistake she could have ended up back in hospital or worse. I asked the hospital pharmacy how this could happen but they wouldn't give me an answer. The medication sheet says the discharge medications were clinically checked by Scott McMurray but he obviously didn't do a very good job of this.

I made a complaint to the hospital on the 8th August. Complaints administrator Hannah Fellows emailed me on the 11th August to say she received the complaint. 6 weeks later and no response. Says it all.",1
"I attended the Hospital after being advised by my GP Surgery. I was given nothing but 100% care and attention. From registering to seeing the nurses, doctors and consultant I was treated professionally and my care was excellent. One Doctor even apologised for having their lunch break, which they shouldn't be apologising for!!! Everyone I met during my visit was exceptional. Thank you for looking after me!",5
"Big thanks to WB5. Nurses are amazing, kind and supportive.",5
"During the early hours on 1st of March 2003, my mum suffered the most horrific, traumatic death at the hands of two nurses in a side ward. Also, at the same time her wedding ring went missing, although it was tight on her finger. I personally have never had a good experience at this hospital. I couldn't post this unless I gave a star!",1
Atrocious  hospital 4 hours in a&e no drinks m/c working the sooner it is closed the better,1
Two weeks ago this hospital treated my 81 year old father for the wrong thing on admission to A&E as he has Alzheimers and they couldn’t be bothered to communicate with family. Today they have sent my 77 year old mum home with a clear infection in her very swollen leg without any treatment or antibiotics. She is currently living alone and cannot walk due to the infection. This hospital is an absolute disgrace.,1
"My father was in the hospital for a bowel/stoma operation and the staff were excellent . They looked after him very well and  and the surgeon, Miss Mcleod was amazing. She and her support staff were excellent in how they treated my father before and after the operation. I will be forever grateful to the staff at Russells Hall for what they have done for my father over the last month",5
Yesterday I  attended the Eye department. All staff were kind caring friendly and very considerate. Everything was explained to me step by step and all questions answered in detail. Well done and thank you to all in the Eye Department...For your Outstanding care 😀 👏,5
"Well just gotta say how lovely the staff from Bay 5 Station 2 and Bay 3 Station 3 was they really looked after me at Russells Hall Hospital. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Plus was great making new friends or bedpals as I'd rather call them.🥰🥰🥰
I'm at home now recovering with the love and care from my lovely fiancée Stacey Walsh.💞💞💞 #russellshallhospital #appendix

"My wife is currently receiving chemotherapy. As anyone who has experienced this treatment and battled with cancer can concur this is a very challenging and traumatic time. The treatment provided by this hospital is awful, totally unreliable and is what I would consider totally disrespectful of patients needs. Treatment is not available on time, appointments are never on time to the point the appointments have been somewhat abandoned leaving patients waiting by their phones on the off chance their treatment will be administered today. typical example is today, appointment is booked, blood tests have been done yesterday, appointment for chemo at 3 o'clock, confirmed last Friday by the hospital and again this morning (Monday at 1pm) and now at 430pm we are advised the drugs are not at the hospital!!! how much more do seriously ill people and their families have to take before this is managed properly. I have voiced my concerned to the hospital staff on numerous times and nothing has got better in three months. I really hope the Hospital senior managers read this along with someone from the CQC because this is about as serious as it gets, negligent possibly, unacceptable definitely and a total lack of respect to all concerned. I would welcome a response from Russells Hall Hospital.",1
"Aside from one doctor in a&e everyone else was rude and couldn't be bothered to do anything when we was there for a good reason! Shocking how bad its got here.
Paramedics who brought us were amazing",2
Cant fault it one bit! Went in to have Appendix out and the care I have received has been excellent. Every staff member I have come across has been helpful and accommodating and nothing is too much trouble! Ward is comfy and quiet and even though unwell has been enjoyable being here,5
"A couple for years ago, I was in a bad place mentally. I was severely depressed and suicidal and took an overdose. I got taken to Russell's Hall hospital and had to stay there overnight.  It was my worst experience.  The nurses were dreadful. They were very nasty saying I was attention seeking and that I didn't deserve treatment and that I should pay for my treatment and even made a petition about me. They spent all night talking about me (loudly) and we're complaining and refusing to come into my cubicle when my machines were screaming because my heart rate and blood pressure were way too high. Even the doctor accused me of attention seeking and agreed with everything the nurses were saying. This hospital lacks compassion for mental health patients and it's sad. Mental health patients have just as much right for treatment as other patients.  We can't help being mentally ill. I am absolutely disgusted in this hospital and I'm glad I live in Wolverhampton so I don't have to go there if I'm ever ill. The nurses and doctors there should be ashamed of themselves.",1
Last night early hrs I went to toilet and noticed blood in my urine . I went on 111 and it told me to go to Russell's hall treatment centre if my gp was closed.so I did it was empty for a change I was seen within 10 minutes he tested my sample I had taken and then checked my stomach and said he had found a small lump I went into panic.  But instead of sending me into a and e he told me to go home and call my own gp to book a scan .surely that's not right I may as well of saved my money and time . Awaiting now for my gp to call me .docs surgery not happy how I was dealt with at hospital as it should of been sorted there,2
"It was a pleasant experience. The nurses were excellent, and it was my birthday. They all wished me ""happy birthday.",5
"Visited A ad E on the advice of my doctor for a vascular problem. The lovely,  pleasant staff eased my concerns. I was treated and sent home, after thorough tests with a weight off my mind. The hospital lovely and clean and I had no problem with parking.",5
"I wouldn't give it any stars if possible.  A disgrace of a place. Needs to be shut down. Mum went in 7 weeks ago with stomach pains. Ended up with too much fluid so had pneumonia and chest infections , Sepsis and a blood clot plus urine infections because of their inability to look after people properly.  On numerous occasions they forgot to put her oxygen back on, given her the wrong medication or someone else's. They havent got a clue what they are doing. You see that many different doctors who tell you different things and contradict themselves. It looks like now she has to go into a Rehabilitation centre because they couldn't be bothered to help her walk. Absolutely disgusting",1
Excellent service given from staff really appreciate there hard work patience & understanding,5
"If you need immediate medical attention , DO NOT GO HERE. My partner was experiencing excruciating chest pains, we rushed to the hospital just after midnight , they saw us straight away which was fine because its a chest problem,  only to be taken to a cubicle and left in there for over 2 hours !!!! I say 2 hours but it could be any amount of time as I'm still here now waiting as I'm writing this review . How busy can it be at 3 am in the morning! There was hardly anybody in a&e , I literally saw no movement from the staff outside the cubicle just laughing and  joking and very relaxed!! How can a hospital not care about its patients! Absolutely shocking !",1
"This as got to be the worse hospital in the world. Omg what a mess! What a waste of time & space.
Came to A & E via ambulance.  Waited outside in ambulance for 50 minutes before being taken inside. ....this was at 11.45pm.  It is now 9.30am the following morning and I'm still waiting to be seen by a Dr.  I'm still waiting to be told my prognosis.  I'm still just waiting",1
"Where do I start, after many years of visiting this hospital with parents due to the unfortunate fact it's their local hospital the service never fails to disappoint and sometimes shock. I know there is indeed good and bad in every profession but it does seem to us this hospital is full of the latter when comparing it to the QE and others. Short stay or day case seems to be better but long term on a ward is not acceptable. No one seems to care or know what's happening, it's difficult to get a nurse or Dr to talk to you, the standard excuse is ""were all very busy"" generally followed by myself then finding 4 of them sat talking about last night's TV. One Dr we did get hold of couldn't speak English to an acceptable level, I understand we have a diverse culture and our medical service attracts people from around the world but surely one of the exams a Dr must pass in the UK is English, fifteen minutes of trying to explain Dad had radiotherapy which finished 6 week's ago would of made a comedy sketch, the Chinese Dr was more confused than us and had resulted in smiling at us before going away and fetching another Dr who I have to say was great, he apologized for the language barrier and said he too has difficulty explained things to her. Amazing how she can diagnose, treat and explain with very little grasp of the English language. I know our NHS does get bad press for nurses pay, lack of funding etc but if Russell Hall is the benchmark standard I can understand why. There are lots of signs around the wards which have a heading of ""we want all our patients to ask us the following questions""  the questions are things like ""what do I have to do to go home?"", "" How long will I remain in hospital?"" ""Explain my treatment to me"" and what do you propose to do to help me recover"" I asked these questions a lot of the nursing staff and only one nurse over a week period gave us answers, the rest either didn't know and said they would ask another nurse to come to the bed or said they were too busy and ask later",1
"Went lat night with my partner. We got there at around 23:30 and didn't leave until 2:30am. The staff were nice even though it was very busy, the wait was long. But having said that, the doctor was absolutely wonderful and my partner was given a prescription after he saw her. The only thing that was a massive let down was them not having a working cash machine. Me and my girlfriend had to walk all around the hospital looking for one, and then over the road to Tesco just so we could pay for the car parking.  My partner was in a lot of pain and was slightly annoyed that she had to walk in the cold when she found it hard to walk far at all. But otherwise i was rather happy with everything else. Just take your own cash if you go here.",3
2 times I was left to give birth alone in this hospital first time was 9 years ago I was high risk birth and I was left on my own to have my baby my mum walked into the room when I gave birth baby was born in her arms with cord wrapped around her neck my mum screamed for the nurse and the horrible nurse said oh you've delivered your grandchild in a cocky way. I had my second baby in this hospital in December again high risk and again left on my own my waters broke naturally at 2am midwife checked cervix said im 10cm dilated my contractions was coming thick and fast they didn't even offer me pain relief she seemed like she didn't wana be at work within 5min after my waters broke baby was born over the toilet in my room baby was born black and blue with burst blood vessels in her eyes because of traumatic an quick birth. Also I had slightly overactive thyroid during pregnancy which caused me problems and the 0 level of communication and care from the endocrinologist clinic was 0 absolutely disgusting. I have reported it all to PALS,1
Rang for an update on an elderly patient who had been admitted following a fall.My call went round and round for 40 minutes. When it was eventually answered the call taker was abrupt and unhelpful. Very unsatisfying experience when you are simply trying to get an update on a frail elderly patient.,1
"Very rarely get taken here coming from Oldbury. My 1st experience was a bad 1 when I ruptured ankle ligaments. However on this occasion  I took my daughter to the walk in centre and she was rapidly taken through to a&e paediatrics with very high temperature and low oxygen levels. The staff were amazing. Polite, reassuring and had the upmost care for both me and my daughter. Cant fault them for their care in a time where it must be difficult to work in the profession. G.p has just called to follow up and confirmed she has a UTI/kidney infection. Many thanks to all involved",5
"Emergency don’t work , if you bad , go somewhere else anotherwise will be waiting for 6-9 hours. Rude reception, told me that if I die tonight you not gonna see a doctor tomorrow, disgusting stuff . I been there bcs have chest pain and difficult breathing, nobody cares for the patient here",1
"Came here for a blue hand with a painful arm that i couldn't lift. Doctor i saw seemed annoyed that he was being bothered by me and told to go home. Had a stroke stood there. The care was decent for the stroke and was transferred to queens in birmingham for rest of treatment as they didnt have the facilities. I guess it depends which staff you get, whether you get decent care or not",3
"3 hours waiting in a&e to be told they forgot to add my poorly daughter to the wait list and that we had to wait another 4 hours.

Pathetic place",1
"I was rushed into A & E in a serious condition. After 4 hours I was moved to a ward . Was in hospital for 11 days.  Everything was excellent...treatment , attention from staff (no exceptions), even the food. A bright clean hospital. A big thank you to every member of staff who attended to me.",5
Dr I.G in emergency care is brilliant he gave me a full understanding of what was up with the reason I went in and put my mind at ease 10 stars for him and the kind lady on reception 😀 ❤️,5
Went to anticoagulant unit with mom for blood tests. We from cannock quite far from Russell hall. One nurse Kim Taylor was outstanding. Kept coming in to sort mom out in between her other patients. Couldn't fault her .,5
"So had a Coronectomy done at Russell’s hall three weeks ago. Firstly my “dissolvable stitches” don’t dissolve. Secondly I end up with a dry socket and a concerning red lump I thought to be an abscess developing on the other side to which they say “no reason to be concerned, no antibiotics or packing required”. I did also question their negligence at this stage. My dentist (who was concerned at the hospitals response) then packs the dry socket (a dry socket caused by failed stitching)  to prevent further infection and prescribes more antibiotics on Tuesday. Thirdly, I notice a progressive numbness and tingley pain spreading across the side I had a concerning red lump. Tonight I look, and what do I find? A nice burst abscess. Thank you yet again for surgery that has caused more problems than its purpose, and your negligent post care.

No wonder NHS Dudley group are being constantly investigated for negligence when this is how people are treated.

This was rejected to be published on NHS website so always check these reviews first for honest reviews",1
"Firstly, hats off to the Facilities staff who work very hard and have genuine interest towards their attitude toward empathy. Absolutely great bunch of people - the security staff on the maternity ward in particular were great, however the opposite to be said about the midwives.

We'll try our upmost best to get over to BWH or another good hospital on our next child. Wether it was our luck of a combination of bad midwives or that's just the way they are, I do not know. Our experience wasnt great - more stress than needed.

Parking is relatively cheap though and if you get a single bay, you're less likely to get a door ding.",1
"Just had a new hip absolutely fantastic team work in the operating rooms very caring ,,.and on the wards came home next day ,
Thank you all very much",5
"Disgusting been calling for 10 mins no answer while we were on phone yesterday to very poorly pt we asked him what ward he was on he was saying excuse me to the nurse
5 times she ignored him then I heard her say I'm not closing this door because your shouting she

is in the wrong job as no way is this a caring attitude I work for the NHS with pts and would never ignore a pt asking a question she should be embarrassed and get a job not dealing with people as I wouldn't treat an animal like that this is b3 ward. Also had several messages from pt saying he wanted to return to new cross as nurses were not nice to him at Russell's Hall one told him he was bluffing his illness and now heartbroken to say he never got his wish.",1
Rude reception staff. Poor communication skills and not disability aware. Hearing impaired patients will struggle with unhelpful staff wearing face masks. Was referred to hospital having contacted NHS 111 to be told I was not an emergency case by reception staff even though 111 nurse said I needed x-ray asap. All hearing impaired patients should go to another hospital if possible. QE and City Road far better.,1
"I recently underwent major surgery at this Trust the care and attention I received was unbelievable,from the consultant to the cleaners everyone was happy had time for you ,food was always hot a good choice on the menu  and tasty ,and then after discharge the nurses on the dressing clinic were wonderful they work3d so hard to get my wounds healing I was attending 3 times a week and had continuity of staff fantastic place",5
"My nan went in for a slight fall & should of been sent home the same day but , they wouldn't discharge her so she was stuck in there for nearly a month & she died ! The care was diabolical while in there she ended up with a virus me & my family caught & the nurses were coughing to. They gave her antibiotics yet again she was allergic too when my mum had already informed them not to & they stopped her meds didn't give her a drink she was covered in bruises on her arms her head & the day she died on my aunties birthday the staff told my auntie she was just sleeping & all the staff did was stand around doing nothing , the place is a disgrace. When you go in there your more likely to come out in a wooden box ! Maybe its time you bought back matrons on wards instead of having teens & woman ready to retire running them.",1
"I put together this review whilst convalescing in my private room on ward B1. Having been under the care of Dr Rajan Patel I am grateful for his expertise in his medical field and the respect and dignity he offers his patients. A heartfelt thank you Dr Rajan Patel for carrying out my procedure and the years of care you have provided me. Gratitude and thanks also goes to Russell’s Hall hospital anaesthetists, doctors, nurses, porters, food providers, cleaning and all staff for your attention offered during this time of international pandemic. Optimum healthcare was offered, nothing was lacking in patient attention. Thank you and best wishes to Sam for being there when I came round from my operation, to B1 nursing night staff especially Irene for your vigilance and support, to the kind doctor who came to visit me and to the wonderful Matilda of the morning nursing staff too. I leave with immense gratitude for all the kindness you have all shown me and may it be returned in abundance to you all.

"Multiple drug dosing & prescribing errors and lack of interdepartmental communication. Don’t trust anyone, check, triple check and take names of everyone so they can be held accountable and learn from their errors to improve patient care.",1
"I have to say that this is the worst hospital I have had misfortune to experience.
It's a new building with all the mod cons but the vast majority of the staff appear to be working with Victorian values and out to do as little as possible so it doesn't interfere with their private conversations.  They are not interested in the patient's at all.  There are the odd exceptions, you can find some who are excellent but your lucky if you can find them (needle in a haystack).  I could go on for hours about their poor and sometimes almost diabolical care.  All I can suggest is that if your unfortunate enough to end up here know exactly what they are supposed to do for you in detail and what you should expect to happen with your treatment and aftercare.  Don't be afraid to shout and insist they do it right, they only listen to who shouts the most and loudest as it interferes with their never ending tea breaks.   This trust is desperately in need of new management and staff discipline.
OUT OF CONTROL, AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.",1
"I have no problem with the hospital. The outpatient department always runs on time. I find the biggest problem is the 20 to 30 minutes it takes me to find a parking space.Today July 1st 2014 the traffic stretched from the car park to the main road, and there wasn't any spaces to be had, not even a disabled space. And although I arrived with 15 minutes spare for my appointment I ended up being 15 minutes late due to this factor. In fact I spent more time in the car park than I did in the hospital.",4
My sister was admitted to Ward C3 at Russell's Hall Hospital with delerium. The nursing staff were excellent and went above and beyond to make a frightend and vulnerable patient as secure and calm as possible. Highest commendation to an excellent team; you are all a credit to the NHS.,5
"Called through to gynaecologist department as cousin was in excruciating pain, got through to the secretary of Dr Fitzgibbon (Julie) who was exceptionally rude, with no help or guidance from her my cousin was left helpless in pain.
When making an appointment or seeing if they’re were any cancellation to speed the process up (guided by gp) I was told not to call back because “she doubt there will be any anytime soon”. Considering she is an outpatient and possibly undergoing surgery I feel as though it’s highly unacceptable as staff should be more considerate towards there patients who could be going through a lot of stress and trauma. When asked for her name she was hesitant and told me that she was just known as his secretary then finally as I was persistent she gave her first name and refused to give her surname.

Julie should be trained in etiquette as she lacks in basic phone manners.",1
"Had CRT-D Pacemaker fitted In cardiology day case unit, I cannot fault this place staff were absolutely brilliant so was Dr Barr who performed my operation , I was very scared but put at ease I would have no problem going back for any further treatment keep up the great work guys 👍",5
"I was treated diabolically by this hospital, was referred there in December 2018 for a minor operation, saw the consultant in February 2019 was told he could treat me, then they kept me waiting till October2019 to be told the trust had no finance for this operation and referred me back to the Queen Elizabeth, was a complete waste of my time with no thanks or explanation what so ever. Avoid if you can.. - Glenn",1
"It's not even worthy of a star. The staff there when my recently deceased grandfather in there was appalling. Left in a room alone doped up on oramorph, buzzer out of reach. He fell out his chair twice due to neglect. An 89 year old man recovering from a broken hip. He still had nightmares up until the day he passed away. Absolutely disgusting. No compassion there at all. He died yesterday at home with people he loved and was cared for by his family and care in the community. The district nurses were fantastic. Shame on you Russell's Hall. I wouldn't let them look after a dog, let alone a human being.",1
"A and E doctors are friendly and nice but they are also not good at finding the issue your there for that matters. There from 6.30pm in excruciating pain in my belly and aching all over after vomiting early hours the day before.
8 hours in A and E they still didn't find the problem but knew I had an infection, around 2am I told a nurse my throat was really hurting bad and they said the Dr will look when he comes round in a bit, it turned 4:30am, in so much pain with my throat that no doctor had checked so I asked a different nurse, and another that told me I'm not a doctor. I had to argue and raise my voice, probably damaging my throat more, to be heard so she got someone to come as she saw I wasn't backing down and the one that looked at my throat was shocked and said it was inflamed. they then tried to give me penacilin 6 times after me telling them I throw up on penacilin then gave me something else instead that I think still contained penacilin but they was okay. They passed the book to the medical team with no diagnosis even after looking at my throat and all the time my throat was hurting in the night I could see the Dr's sitting at their desks with other Dr's coming sharing information about patients coming in not knowing each others names because they just met up online, what's happened to patients confidentiality? Obviously that don't matter in A and E. After arriving at the ward from being in A and E for around 9 hours it really did feel like I died at went to heaven. My Dr come round within 2 hours and I told him that no one knows where the infection is I have after taking loads of my bloods, a finger up the bum, balls examined, x-ray of my chest and wee samples but no one looked at my throat once until I started to raise my voice so can you please check if I have tonsillitis, he took one look for just 2 seconds, maybe 3, and he diagnosed me with tonsillitis, do you want your certificate he said, I said what for, he said for self diagnosis, it will be in the form of your discharge letter, yes please I replied. I told him about my experience and he said to raise it to make people aware of my neglect as something needs doing. A and E is a deathtrap and makes the wards look like heaven. On my way to the ward they nearly sent me back but I told them I'm not going back there and I will discharge myself and go to my Dr's that will look at my throat as soon as I walk in, they sorted something out as they saw I was destressed and put me on the ward. I was in so much pain everywhere when I went in to the hospital and so many questions that they have to ask I couldn't concentrate on much but to try and deal with the pain and I had to have morphine to deal with the pain hours after I was there. It settled everything but confused me. A and E said that I should of told the Dr's about my throat trying to make me to blame of what they missed, I told them I was in so much pain everywhere and confused with little sleep for around 3 days, I didn't ask him to put his fingers up my bum, he asked me! I didn't sleep in there incase they did something, I don't trust people too much and they didn't make me feel that I could sleep and I had to watch everything they was doing. It's disgusting how they let it be like this, too many people think you know nothing and they know everything. STAY CLEAR OF THIS A AND E IF POSSIBLE. Disscharged on the 25-04-19",1
"I would like to thank the staff on B2 hip suite for the fantastic care they have given my dad Maurice over the last 4 and half weeks following a fall resulting in a fractured hip. The staff particularly the CSW's who have cared for dad, Sooi and John, Lisa and Karen and Bev have been brilliant even when they have been extremely short staffed dad's ward was always attended due to the fact patients had dementia. You only get to read the bad press what a pity they don't print the good stuff. Keep it up guys you earn every penny and do your job from the heart. Heart felt thanks to you all xxx Also fantastic physios Amanda, Matt and Alex such lovely people who love their job and do it from the heart y",5
I went with family member to A&E on Sunday 8th June by ambulance . The A&E were on amber alert after we had been there 3hours the nurses were run off there feet and flagging in the heat. No one seemed to know what any one was doing every one doing bits of everything but nothing getting done . No one being moved on so cubicle full reception full. We waited 5/6 hours in the end self discharged as A&E was making things worse. An elderly man kept walking in and out cubicle asking for a drink he was there hours without fluid in that heat. Nurses worked hard but no one in charge getting things done,2
The care has been fantastic by who ever has treated me today but wow what a dirty place the urgent treatment centre is all windows covered in god knows what from children  cigarette butts all over the floor when it’s a none smoking site don’t even get me started on parking there is not enough spaces for urgent treatment centre the paint work is scratched off everything leather ripped down the back of wheel chairs broke chairs in the waiting room rubbish on floors cups everywhere I’ve worked in care homes for 15 years and it would be gross misconduct if a room was ever left that was in the home never seen a domestic person the whole 4 n half hours I was here what a let down our money spent on nhs and it looks like this shameful,3
This hospital is fantastic. The staff were all friendly and down to earth and looked after me during my short stay at A&E for pericarditis. They definitely put patients as the number 1 priority and should all get raises.,5
"This was the second time I had had to have a arthritis injection by Mr Marsh, and as exactly as the first time everything went very well.

From start to the finish the whole  procedure was first class. The staff were very efficient, friendly and very very professional. I cannot praise them enough!

Thanks to Mr Marsh, his staff and all at Russells Hall Hospital.",5
I broke my arm a couple months ago they helped me and they were understanding,5

"Attended in June of 2019 for a pre op. Pre op showed I had diabetes. I have since got my diabetes under control, but almost a year after seeing my GP I’m still suffering with the first ailment. Almost a year with a broken nose and not one nights sleep in over 12 months.  I have been forgotten about and feel very disappointed.
I asked my gp’s surgery if there was any sign of an admission date to fix my broken nose, but all they could tell me was the same as I already knew. (Letter from diabetic clinic to ent telling ent that my bloods are now under control)
Where else can a broken bone be ignored for so long? Disgusted to say the least.",1
"Thank you so much for all the doctors, nurses, and all the staff.
I saw staff like this a first-time
This is brilliant .
Thank you so much once again for everything.",5
"My father was admitted COVID free to a COVID free ward, got COVID. Staff then wanted to release him with positive COVID test and symptoms to the family.  When informed that was not possible as we are COVID free, they got aggressive and rude. I would not trust this hospital with looking after my hamster. Vile nursing  staff.",1
"I've recently received a new opthalmology treatment for glaucoma. The consultant, nursing team and organisational processes were all impressive. I am about to move area and want to thank Russells Hall hospital for the care and the treatment I've received over the years that I've lived in the Black Country. I haven't given five stars because no organisation of this size can possibly be perfect (giving one star, in my view, is equally unlikely to be accurate). Sometimes I've been annoyed by waiting times, the occasional irritable receptionist and car park charges etc but, taken in the round and, allowing for the fact that we're all human and aren't perfect, this is a good hospital.",4
Nine hours and still no doctor. Rubbish service. I have been nursing my 80 year old father on a trolley single handed for nine hours. Disgusting way to treat people. I would strongly recommend attending this place if your strong enough. The NHS should pack it in if they think that this is ok,1
"After a traumatic experience with my own last baby where i had 10 failed attempts at having a catheter in my arm and badly bruised arms for days,i attented the birth of my grandchild. My daughter was induced and ignored for hours when she told them her waters were leaking. After hours had still not progressed. Waited hours to be transfered to delivery. Had hormone drip and was in a lot of pain yet kept waiting 2 hours 4 anaesthetist to administer epidural. Who then decided it was too late as was 9cm dialated. Was left a further 2 hours with no pain relief at all and struggled to push after 2 and a half hours of unsuccessful pushing which ended in suction cup and also forceps and being cut all with no pain relief apart from local anaesthetic! She has been left very traumatised as was her first child and spent a total of 32 hours in labour  and unable to pee by herself. Cant fault the 1st midwife who dealt withher she was amazing and talked her thru everything but was replaced at shift change when all the complications started to appear.",1
"Bravo Urgent Care and B5 for such responsive well lead efficient care,!.
What was care planned for me to be transferred to Newcross W'Hampton (miles for my family to get to) I was cured at B5 without the transfer - It took me being patient and not expecting the world (as in you ask the nurse for something and expect it that very next second they have how many people to care for) might I add (my dr was on a 12 hour shift and still had a smile for me) so trusting in the medicine and diagnosis, throught having the compassion back to the staff what we expect as patient's got me my result. I wanted to post this as whilst i was there I experienced so much negative almost like other patient's couldn't see the bigger picture just clouded by negative vibes totally not me, through staying positive and greatful got my result. Thank you Russell Hall. RIA.D.BX",5
"The best, staff were fantastic to me during a three week stay. Care with kindness. A fantastic team and great level of care. Thank you very much.",5
"The waiting is something else.but when they fine out you are really ill they give u priority,that is what I like about Russell's hall  hospital.",4
Was my first day on agency the car parking had ample space and just opposite the main entrance and it only costed me 5.00 for the whole day and the theatre staff were amazing I really enjoy working in theatres.,4
Can't find a lot to complain about other than the parking fees. Staff have always been helpful. Most of the  doctors and nurses are brilliant. My family have always been treated well here.,5

On Monday 17th June, my mother visited A+E at Russells Hall. She had been complaining of s very painful left hip and our gp thought she needed an x ray to see if she had damaged the hip. She was x rayed and while in minor injuries area, told she had not broken the bone but she had arthritis. We did point out that the pain had come on suddenly and she was unable to weight bear, whereas before she was quite mobile. She was seen by a therapist who got her to walk with the aid of a walking frame, given pain killers and sent home.
Over the next few days the pain intensified and led to her being completely immobile and making her feel too unwell to eat or drink very much.
On Saturday 22nd I took her back to A+E because she was getting worse. This time she was seen in major injuries and more x rays were done. Again she was told there was no fracture and seen by a therapist who saw her walk a few steps with a frame and declared her ok to go home. She was given a supply of co-codamol and ibuprofen 400 to help with pain. On Monday 24th after complaining about being in severe pain and constant nausea I contacted her gp and requested a home visit. I received a phone call from the gp advising her to stop taking co-codamol and ibuprofen as this could be making her nauseous and just use paracetamol.
On the 26th things had not improved so I requested another gp visit. The gp examined my mother and was very concerned and sent for an ambulance.
In A+E a CT scan was carried out and we were shocked to be told that mother had suffered a hip fracture. She had been in agony for nearly two weeks trying to follow hospital instructions to keep mobile using a walking frame. Because of the pain and discomfort she was in she had lost her appetite and not felt like drinking due to feeling nauseous.
We became aware that not being able to eat or drink had led to blood pressure problems and other organ issues and she was now seriously ill.
At about 11.00pm she was transferred to HDU where her strength finally gave way and she passed away.
I am aware that sometimes fractures can be difficult to spot but the radiologists and nurse practitioners and doctors had several chances to spot the fractured hip. My mother and myself explained the symptoms time and time again so together with two lots of x rays someone should have had the sense to realise it was more serious than arthritis!
Hopefully your response will not contain phrases such as, lessons will be learned, as mother had worked hard all her life and was really enjoying her life. She clearly deserved better treatment than she was given.",1
"My granddaughter was taken to russelshall hospital after a accident at school.My daughter informed me how some of the drs had told my granddaughter you will have stitches and you will scar,evidently at newcross a different rapour altogether,a brilliant consultant and staff making my granddaughter relaxed.A message to russelshall hospital children are children try to show a bit more empathy,whatever culture you are.",1
"They are keeping my wife in the hospital for 2 days now with no treatment, no tests and surprise!!! Today no food but God forbid you bring food. You are not allowed! That's not a hospital, that Auschwitz!!!",1
Been here since 12:20. My misses had a scan and seeing a doctor. It's 16:00pm and we are still here.  40 weeks +1 day pregnant. No one seems to be doing their job. How can we be here for so long and no progress.,1
My mother was admitted with jaundice and vomitting twice. The second time she was diagnosed as liver cancer. A day later they changed their minds and discharged her without even contacting the family to come and collect her. She is 78 and left to find her own way home and still no diagnosis. Her care was negligent and disgusting. Shame on you all as supposed carers I am thoroughly disgusted with you all,1
"Took in with pain's in my chest
And the staff were fine friendly and polite
The doctor's I spoke too also
Always keep in your mind that there is a hell of a lot for these people to deal with
Keep up the good work to all the staff 👍🏼",5
"Went to get a health concern checked out. Swiftly given directions at the reception and was able to check in at the ward easily and was seen by a Doctor within the hour.
Parking was the only issue. Granted there’s charges. I paid £3.60. But the entry and exit are crazily at the same location, so in and out streams conflict.",5
"I was treated yesterday with severe shortness breath, hospital is very clean, staff are amazing, doctors take pride for saving life’s, can’t fault this hospital and it’s staff, I had to done cardiacs checks, doctors found that my blood oxygen was low, my blood test came with chest infection together with asthma, so this was the reason I was really bad, couldn’t breath properly, coughing was making me awful due to asthma getting worse.

God bless NHS, government needs to invest more and pay proper wages for all the workers, they do an amazing job without excitation to go extra mile.",5
"Recently visited Emergency Treatment Centre. Treated within an hour by friendly Doctors. The department is currently undergoing cosmetic refurbishment, but this doesn't impact negatively on care.  Great work, please keep it up :)",5

"Visited urgent care waited 4 hrs with a friend with breathing difficulties. The doctor, think he was a doctor never introduced himself.hardly spoke, never even listened to her chest. Sent home without doing bloods or anything was just told to see gp.",1
A brilliant hospital and seen in under 4 hrs. In a bed within 6 and surgery the next morning. Home safe and sound in just three days. Great teamwork all the way through. Thank you' Russells Hall Hospital.,5
"My father was taken into Russell's Hall with a blocked catheter, district nurses were unable to flush it themselves. Russell's Hall fitted a new catheter and he was discharged the same day. However, the catheter they fitted came out of it's own volition, meaning another admission to hospital. It should've been fitted correctly at the hospital, who also did nothing to address his confusion (caused by dehydration).",1

"Medical director needs to look into Dr Varkey's conduct at the eye clinic, north wing.  She kept me waiting for over 2 hours in the waiting room without any acknowledgement or explanation   PALS ran around trying to find me another doctor which they did and am thankful for that",1

Everything was done quick and efficiently lovely staff and he even got to ride a  electric remote control sports car down to theatre which helped him feel at ease and not scared couldn't fault our treatment and care 👌,5
They done my pregancy scan and then they said they couldn't find my baby and then they done a pregancy test they took a second to do it and then she said it was negative (they didnt show me the test) when it was just 2 weeks ago i was told i heard the baby heart beating! I was told i was 18 weeks and these nurses who scanned me said there wasn't a baby there! When I'm sure there is because i still feel her move!,1

Clean hospital with friendly staff. Visited the urgent care centre at 6.30pm which would be one of their busiest times and was seen after 2 hours which isn't bad for a hospital. Doctor was very friendly and reception staff were also nice,5
"The physiotherapy dept. is excellent. The staff are pleasant, helpful and understanding. Karen, my physio is great, she is very supportive and will always answer questions and suggest alternatives. I can't fault this department.",5
I had a horrible experience spent over 9 hours in a e department with my 18 months old son. But obviously everyday is different in hospitals depending on which staff and how many staff and how busy they are. They could have been just having a bad day,1

"Called 111 Para medics came out.
Told me it could be Dental but go and see Doctor at Russells Hall.

Decided to go to QE seen Doctor and consultant.I have aSavila gland infection.now staying overnight. Shows the kind carrying hospital Russells Hall is",2
"Can't praise the staff enough.. everyone from nurses, student nurses, auxillaries, sisters.. all where great.
Drs where also friendly and explained things.
Only one bad apple.. Joanne, (bleached blonde hair in pony tail. She is small) a very stroppy care assistant who was shouting at a couple of patients in pain..To that particular CA., Joanne,,, I WOULD have reported you.
ONE THING HOSPITAL BOSSES...
Why make cleaners do kitchen work???
It's unhygienic, and some days the ward was not getting a full clean...
If it ain't broke don't fix it!!!",5
I spent 5 days on the children's ward and I was overwhelmed by how hard all the staff work and still manage to have time to care for mine and my son's needs. I am so grateful for everything they did and the excellent care we received.,5
"Absolutely shamble of an NHS hospital, patient care is diabolical and needs serious investigation for duty of care and safety and safeguarding",1
Staff is ok but one support worker  Marian she is excellent worker my daughter was born on 16 of August and marian was on day shift i want to say her thanks a lot and keep it up you are doing great,4
"Our NHS ia amazing all round...but special praise to the Rheumatology team at Russells Hall & Corbetts . The nurses and consultants are exceptional.always helpful and friendly...using clear, concise terminology. Receptionists are always smiling..a major feat with such a busy dept...especially with the likes of me who's fibro fog regularly messes up appointment attendance. Their emergency help line always answered. Huge respect to this team.
Thank you. Without you all I'd be stranded...literally. 😊❤👍",5
"Where do I start???? Well, all I can say is this hospital is an absolute joke. . . The staff are damn right rude, they haven't got time for all the patients that they are supposed to be looking after, they pass you from pillar to post without telling you what's going on, the doctors don't wait around to tell you the results of your scan etc even if you were in the toilet, being told one thing and then they go back on what they originally said. The list continues and I could go on all day. . . Looks like it's a visit to the PALS department to complain and to discharge myself and go to the QE. I wouldn't of give this place any stars but unfortunately, I had to give it at least 1. . . . Avoid this place at all costs and go to the QE.",1
I am really grateful to all the staff for the fantastic care . May be some delays that's to be expected. Thère are 3so many patients being treated. I am certainly grateful for the care attention I've received.,5
"Thank you to Endocrinology Team, blood test yesterday. Call from Tom, very early this morning explaining results, Prescription ready for pickup later this morning. Thank you for the care you give. And always do.",5
Cafe has seating area blocked out for staff only. So you have to seat outside. Then secuirty move you to the smoking area . With elderly people this is not good to say the least,1
"Went around 3am for possible ruptured spleen and the nurse was absolutely brilliant.
Love down to earth staff and these made me feel my worth even though I feel run down... Thanx guys, brilliant hospital",5
Worst hospital ever staff are rude and should be thought manners and all we are is just cattle to these people. Shows the type of management that work here as this reflects on the staff. Should have a major staff cut as majority of them are useless and talk In a load of nonsense.,1
"Spent 4 days and nights, 1st on the acute medical ward and then on C5 I have nothing but admiration for all the staff under awful situations. Everyone talks about hospital food but I was surprised by the choice and quality",5
After travelling and living around the world I think it's time the British people realise how lucky they are to have such wonderful service. Most of the staff have smiles and are frindly.  You are very very lucky. Well done to you all,4
"Great nurses but a shame about the doctors and overwhelmed with ""leeches"" like most hospitals nowadays",5
This hospital has very bad memories for me and my wife. First my wife's mother had died here after been left in the hall waiting for a bed. And my brother died here but I cannot fault the Georgia Unit that helps people who has leukaemia. It's just sad that he died.,3
Great job Mr Mohan and his team. Went for day surgery this morning in at 7.30 discharged at 11.00. All staff were amazing kind and friendly which made me feel at ease. Thank you x,4
"Cleaner in paediatric team very rude, one student nurse spoken rudely about one of the patients family member very inappropriate and very unprofessional.",1
Went in to Russell hall hospital told in casualty  told them I had suicidal feelings. Doctor told the nurse to give me painkillers. She came put them in my hand then walked out its disgusting.,1
I was in a car accident I suffer with my nevers I have mental health conditions I was I a sate the receptionist told me I couldn't have my partner stay with me even though I'm vulnerable they said unless I was there for my mental health I couldn't have anyone stay with me I was so upset I had to leave to go to sandwell hospital this place is horrible staff are extremely horrible avoide,1
This place was going to switch off my life support machine when I was in a coma the nurse told me that when I woke up.  They kicked me out to live in a maisonette alone no help or support from the neighbours when I could barely walk.  In short this place exemplifies all that is wrong with the nhs how much does it cost to keep you alive.,1
Disgusting got a pt sitting swelling in neck feeling like throat is closing up and 6 hours later still sitting in urgent care and told 9 people in front of him when there were 20 people originally so 11 patients  seen in 6 hours yes I understand there are emergencies but surely they would be seen in a and e I work for NHS and I know our patients would not wait for over 6 hours to be seen.,1

"My Grandson was on the children's ward last night, no one seemed to be doing anything only talking amongst themselves, he had a high temperature a heart rate of 155 and was breathing fast, the put him on a heart monitor and left,  my daughter had to ask for ibuprofen to try and bring his temperature down to which the nurse replied if that's what you want I'll get you some, he was on the ward for 5 hours and that is all they done, it took 3 different doctors to check him for the last one to say he had a upper chest infection, the  Saturday before he was taken by ambulance to the hospital and they said he had croup and was sent home obviously he shouldn't have come home, This hospital reminded me of something from a 3rd world country.",1
"On two occasions I've been on hold for over an hour trying to do the simplest of things - last time I was trying to cancel an appointment.

Very frustrating",1
I was taken to A & E by wonderfully caring Paramedics. I had exemplary treatment by all of the staff..it seems the heat was too much for this old dear...thank you ❤,5
Have nothing good to say. Place isn't fit for purpose and the patients suffer as a result. Go to a different hospital if you can.,1
Went in for a few nights stay after being referred for a brain tumour. Nurses spent the night talking and laughing loudly on the ward - got zero sleep. Really uncommunicative and unhelpful.,1
Urgent care centre what a joke receptionist is rude can tell she clearly doesn’t want to be there no caring no empathy ridiculous waiting time one patient goes in and comes out no one else is called in for ages after don’t see this hospital ever improving something needs to be done,1
Very dissapointed at how soon they sent my mom home after a serious operation. Also after discharging her at 11am she had to wait till 6.30pm for her medication,1

Safe to say this is the worse hospital I've ever been to. Just be warned you could end up leaving in a body bag. The NHS at its worse!,1
0 stars. Issued complaint to PALS and still nothing has been resolved. Avoid maternity and early pregnancy centre,1
Been waiting over 3 months for an emergency appointment despite loosing a lot of blood everyday! And a family history of bowel cancer. Very disappointing,1
"I have just returned home after a 13 day stay on c5 russells hall  hospital i can honestly say the staff from drs to domestics were marvellous the care and treatment  i received  was 100% they went beyond duty to help my consultant  and his team dr Philip brammer i cant thank enough you hear so many bad reports of this hospital  and staff, once again a huge thank you for helping me god bless you all true angels and when im up and about im going to do a raffle to help buy something for the respetory  ward c5 10/10 excellent  👏👏👏👏",5

Steady decline in staff and services .I have been going to this hospital at least 3 times a week for treatment  for 7 years they are understaffed and it's getting worse and now it's very difficult to contact them over the phone you're either cut off or no one answers .The doctor's and nurses try there best under the extremely difficult circumstances but because of the extreme stress they face daily they are leaving which is making a bad situation worse.,1
I must say staff on ward b1 are fab and the very nice smoking Marshall by maternity entrance couldn't have been more helpful,4

"Passed from pillar to post 24/7. I’ve worked for the last NHS for 7 years & this is the worst I’ve seen care given, spoken to about 12 different people and have all told me different things, had a diagnosis and then when asked okay what now? Was told to wait for a consultation, 3 months later and I’m being made to feel like my diagnosis didn’t even happen and I’m sat with worsening symptoms & can’t get no help. I can compromise with the staff on how busy it gets, but allowing someone to wait 3 months with symptoms getting worse and not so much as an appointment/check up is just beyond unacceptable.",1
"Horrible, I went to the emergency room with my 1-year-old child and he didn't care, I don't recommend it",1
"Amazing: I was in and out of a&e WITH a prescription within 3 hours start to finish. After past experiences at New Cross, Walsall is a far better hospital! Every member of staff was super friendly and made me feel at ease, the dr listened to me and my needs and really took her time to understand my problem, she also got to the route of the issue whereas I’d been fobbed off at New Cross previously. Moving here to having my baby now in May. Thank you",5
"Haven’t been to this hospital in many years and was worried when mom was being sent to their a and e department. Wow is all I can say. The staff and facilities are way better than the other hospitals in the area and they really do have their triage and care process nailed down. Wait time for triage…. 6 minutes. We arrived by ambulance just before 9 and had relevant blood tests, X-rays and treatment and were discharged by 11.15. No waiting 4 hours for an X-ray or blood test. All done in rapid time and efficiently. And the friendliness of the staff really puts patients and their relatives at ease. This will deff be my first choice for urgent treatment. Well done and thank you manor hospital urgent treatment and emergency department.",5
"My dad died here last year from Covid, they neglected his health, took off his oxygen mask when he was on 30% oxygen, nurses on ward 7 were the worst- they were rude to him, gave him no food/ water, couldn’t show simple human kindness such as charging his phone as he wasn’t able to move. Worst part is doctors who didn’t intervene to send him to ICU when his oxygen was at 20%. As a family we were told about his death 2 hours after with no reason. Worst hospital ever and I hope ward 7 staff are held accountable one day. So many of my family/ friends have said they experienced neglect especially when they’re coloured person, elderly and can’t speak English!",1
"Hubby sent to Emergency care by 111 and have to say triage were quick and brilliant. Kerry Bolton who took care of us and treated hubby was exceptional.  5 stars for her. 3 stars is rubbish parking trying to get near the department when the patient is disabled. Thanks again to Kerry though, an absolute gem.",3
"As people who live in Walsall, this has always been our go-to hospital, my mum has been visiting here frequently as of late, for her cancer treatment, appointments etc. I cannot fault this hospital. They have made sure that they provide us with so much support, all the staff have been really friendly and nothing is ever too much trouble. The hospital is really clean and I have a lot of trust in all the staff for what they are doing to take care of my mum. Overall FAB hospital",5
"Amazing care is provided at walsall, the staff work very hard! They deserve credit for the hard work they do daily! Katie in ICU is like no other nurse she is amazing and provided outstanding care to our sister! She is calming explains everything and gave us a lot of her time while she was working away. Katie is an amazing nurse we hope walsall know how lucky they are to have such a caring nurse. Thank you for all you did xxx",5
"Terrible hospital which is a shame because it used to be one of the best. 6 hours in a&e to be seen for severe back pain. No offer for pain relief just left to sit there. When you ask the receptionists a question you clearly are being inconvenient. I asked how many people are in front of me and she said loads of people because there is a lot of poorly people, basically saying that I didn’t matter. I witnessed a person with piles get seen before a little girl who clearly needed attention for her cough but obviously they didn’t see it as a priority, I witnessed a drunk female with a cut on her lip come in and out within 30 minutes whilst a lady sat there wincing in pain in a wheelchair. Honestly this place is absolutely horrible. I was sent a text when I first arrived advising of an approx 3.20 wait! Almost 6 hours and still here. Please don’t waste your time with this place it’s full riff raff and jumped up staff who think they’re god! Oh but if you know the receptionist like one patient did you’ll get seen very quickly!",1
My elderly mother was admitted to this hospital on Saturday. I can only say that her treatment was first class and that I was not ignored by anyone while accompanying her. I myself have been treated at this hospital and my treatment was second to none. Thanks for to every one of the staff for your caring and professionalism.,5
"It's a great hospital and has been extensively renovated with the addition of a brand-new, more spacious, and I think a better waiting room, in the newly-named Urgent & Emergency Care Centre. I've just returned home from there, and couldn't believe the transformation of the place. It's pretty impressive. No more cramped old waiting room and overspill corridor. I felt strange in the new place at first, but it's a necessary upgrade.",5
"I've ALWAYS had bad things to say about this hospital. I've found them incompetent, waste of time etc. However, today I went in for an operation and I can honestly say that from the second I arrived, every single member of staff treated me with the upmost respect and dignity. They were all very friendly, polite, caring, answered all questions professionly and extremely organised. They were such a great team and I can not thank them enough for the care I've received. I really felt that they really put my best interests at heart and were what the NHS should be. Thank you all!",5
"I had an appointment with orthopedic surgeon mr.G.A . He explained me everything regarding my spine , he listened , he checked my physical condition and movement, doctor reffered me to physiotherapy. It was the first doctor I met which checked on me first instead writing on the computer at the beginning. I was very happy I received  a proper care  like it should be... We need more doctors like this..",5
"I would like to say a big thank you to all team ( from nurse to doctors)And Emergency Department.
the kindness and the care are providing here made me to feel safe and less worried about my illness.
We need more people like this !!!!
Thank you so much!!",5
"Visited A and E recently - the new building is lovely and spacious.  I was seen by the Triage Nurse within half an hour, then taken to the Ambulatory Unit soon afterwards.  The staff were efficient, friendly, introduced themselves and always checked my name and DOB.  They explained the process clearly and informed me when a delay was expected due to awaiting results.  Food and bottled water was provided.  Considering the consultants and junior doctors were striking, the remaining staff didn’t give the impression of being overly stressed (though it must have impacted on them); they remained professional despite having to pass on news of extraordinary delays.  I believe in giving praise when deserved - well done A and E, Ambulatory Care, xray and CT scan staff.",4
"Absolute joke of a place,
waited 7 hours with my 6 year old who was in pain, then in the same week waited over 5 hours overnight to be seen while not many were in… dr Daniel.A was taking 45 mins between patients to do “write ups to GP” when it doesn’t usually take that long on a average day.
I thought the new a&e/utc was supposed to help speed things up but if anything it’s just made it worse. Deeply unimpressed with how things are being handled recently.
Something needs to be done.there’s just no care for the patients anymore.",1
"There is a new A&E department which we have unfortunately had to visit twice this past week with our 14 month old with RSV. Very modern, seen by triage fast and the nurses we met on the second time were amazing. A&E was rather crowded both times but given the time of year it can’t be helped. The reason I haven’t given 5 stars is due to an incident that happened in the main car park on our second trip. We were stuck in there for half an hour, it was grid locked. I got out my car to the only exit barrier to find a very unprofessional security guard arguing with a doctor about paying for parking. He was being extremely rude and condescending to the doctor and even swore at her. A group of people had gathered out of our cars and were trying to reason with the security guard. I asked politely for him to allow her through the barriers and park up outside because of the grid lock in the car park, so the 60-70 plus cars waiting could get out, this was ignored and they continued to argue. Me and my partner were ill and our 14 month old was in the car with RSV all waiting and we needed to go and get medication for her and I needed to get back to work. People weren’t able to park to get to their appointments, woman who had just given birth were having to struggle through the car park to get to their cars. It was ridiculous! After a lot of shouting from the crowd that gathered the doctor inched over so that the car park could empty. Eventually the security guards let the doctor out and the car park cleared but not before having one last shouting match with the doctor before she exited the car park. I have never seen anything like it and hopefully that security guard has been fired.",3
"From the moment my partner dialled 999 at 3am for a heart block . Within a matter of minutes the Ambulance crew were on scene and by all accounts were brilliant, to the treatment I received at A& E and the two wards I was on to discharge this hospital and all the staff I came into contact with excelled .
My treatment and the all the people who looked after me were second to none.
I cannot thank them enough",5
"I was referred to thoracic medicine here, first I had a telephone appointment of around 10 minutes. The letter regarding this to my GP had multiple errors on it, drugs I have never been on, said I had no allergies, but I do. It said I wasn't breathless, but I am, why would I want to see them if I wasn't?
Simple respiratory tests were ordered and I was seen by my consultant just to be told I'm fat, I asked 3 times about a chest x-ray, he said it was fine, I walked out a bit gob smacked, having given up my job, nearly losing my house due to my symptoms and this Dr had not even ordered an x-ray ! What a waste of time, and what a lazy diagnosis",1
"Have been to this hospital twice in the last 3 months no problem, appointments have been on time each visit.  The eye department has been 1st class.",5
"The treatment I received to have three extractions of my teeth removed was nothing short of outstanding!  The Lady (think her name was Cecilia) had such a calming voice, and explained everything. I was so nervous and even questioned if I needed them removed at all. I listened to 80’s music in the background to distract me which really worked. Well done Walsall Manor Orthodontics your team is amazing and a credit to you.",5
Having tried over 10hrs on the phone to find out the condition of my wife's mother.  As we're 300 miles away it very stressful. Today was no difference hours on the phone. Such a disgrace. Would be quicker to drive the 300 miles. These reviews mean nothing as no one takes any notice or action,1
"Today I unfortunately ended up in A,E. With breathing problems.
The staff from beginning to end were fantastic. The porters The nurses the doctor The consultant The clinician Rebecca.
The ambulance staff Harriet and lyndsey.
Thank you to you all. We are very lucky to have so many wonder people in the NHS.xx",5
Absolutely terrible at ever picking up the phone. You dial through to the relevant department and your either disconnected or you wait for 30 minutes on hold being told your next in the queue only for them to hang up on you. What’s the point of listing a contact number on an appointment letter if no one picks up. No wonder the NHS is bleeding money in missed appointment costs. Staff can’t even pick up a phone to allow patients to rearrange an appointment.,1
"I took my daughter with a suspected kidney stone, at 2am. . She was triaged quickly, but the nurse never took her temperature or asked about the possibility of her being pregnant. She did a urine sample, which they lost. We waited three hours to get her any pain relief, despite asking several times. She was extremely distressed and vomiting. But all we were told was resus was full and the wait would be five and a half hours. After three hours they gave her two paracetamol, which she vomited back. The pain became  excruciating and she once again knocked a door and a doctor gave her stronger pain relief. Where was the triage? Finally after asking again, six hours after arriving, she was told by a very surly nurse that the wait was now seven and a half hours. Then a short time after that she was taken through to cubicles. This side of it was well managed and run, she saw a fantastic doctor who treated her with respect and dignity. She had a large kidney stone. My problem lay with the triage system. Totally mismanaged and not really fit for purpose. I also found failings in basic patient care.",3
"My sincere  appreciation and gratitude are extended to the doctors, nurses and support staff of Ward 1 for the excellent and compassionate care extended to my husband Richard. The professionalism and level of care could not be faulted. Moyra Woodward",5
1 star is too much wasted my 6 precious hours for no thing... madness there are more staff than patients and walking around like a boss 😎  while you are about dead all the staff are busy talking they don't give a dam about anyone.. .. and then when you get call to go see them they haven't got a clue 🙄 so many people got the job at this hospital with fake certificate fake degree 😁😁😁😁 good money and good job doing nothing and get big pucket of money 💰  well done 👏 😂😂😂😂 what a scum 👏,1
"Ambulatory care is one of the worst place you can go to, imagine waiting for blood test results for 5 hours and still waiting for ""doctor""  to come see you, when there's literally so many so called  ""doctors"" doing nothing behind computers, on phones and just chatting around with each other was kept on been told your ""next"" for like 2 hours, Even though there was one nurse who kept on telling them we've been waiting for a long time, but they kept ignoring her as if they are so ""busy"" like wth man just do your job, you freaking getting paid for it, if you don't like doing this job just quit, end of.
imagine how many more patients experienced things like this or even worser situations.

"11 hours wait to see a doctor in A&E
No working coffee machines, diabetics waiting wthout access to food, crying children with mothers waiting hours to see someone, anyone. A horror story",1
"If I could have given a zero score, then I would have done so. This must be the worst hospital in the West Midlands & probably the country. I took my adult son after having been given a sealed envelope from our Gp. We went to a ward & a nurse came to do my sons vitals. She looked at the screen & said the machine must be wrong. She fetched a different machine. Then another. She said he had got the highest bp she had ever seen. 353 over 273. Dr. came & told us to go to our Dr's to get some bp lowering meds. We went back to the Dr, who asked why my son wasn't in the hospital. After many mistakes, lies & lack of early diagnosis & treatment, our son died at the hands of the Manor Hospital. The only way to get to the truth was to sue the hospital. We did & we proved medical negligence against the Manor, which they eventually admitted. Although the answers were horrific, at least we knew how & why our son was killed. The hospital later sent us a letter telling us that they COULD have saved our sons life on at least 3 occasions. The Manor Hospital, Walsall, has since treated several others in a similar way, with the same horrific outcome. My family & I will never go to that hospital ever again. If you love your family, don't let them go here for any reason.",1
"My brother fell 8 weeks ago, he didn't call an ambulance but instead got a family member to take him to A&E at The Manor. He is or was extremely fit and knew immediately that something was wrong. They did examine the knee but refused to do  xrays and told him to see his doctor. He went again 2 days later and again was refused xrays. They THOUGHT it was probably a tendon injury. He visited his GP who arranged a MRI scan. He got the result yesterday his GP phoned him and told him he had fractured a bone. Now my brother is retired so he hasn't lost any work days but his daily life as been severely impacted the last few weeks. He now has to attend a hospital ( not the manor) to get this treated and potentially looking at another several weeks of recovery which should have been started 8 weeks ago. Shocking. I have had positive experiences at this hospital myself but I am so annoyed",4
Poor communication and service i had pre op in january for an operation and am still waiting for procedure even the pals office back the staff who work there and cannot help the sick in society please note i spent 48hrs in A&E and was sent home after with no medicine update now a year later and still no operation date the NHS staff are very selfish and uncaring and it's all about money rises. please not persons over 60 are pushed to the back of the queue hoping we will die,1
"I just want to publicly say a massive thank you to Ward 14 at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust - Walsall Manor Hospital and Community Health for taking care of my Mom Heather Bougen over the last several months and even more so over the past few days.

So to all the Ward Doctors, Ward Manager Finula, Ward Sisters Vanessa, Precious and Kerry, Nurses Mike, Jennifer, Leslie plus other Nurses I can’t remember the names of sorry and also to the Clinical Support Workers Rachel, June, Chelsea, Rebekah and Wendy thank you for everything and you have done for my mom and for me, especially over the past few days and for honouring hers and my wishes while she passed away. None of you will ever be forgotten by me.

Also a big thanks to all the staff on Ward 15.

Also I want to say Thank you to Ward 16 Doctors & Nurses and also to Clinical Support Workers Shelly & Anna for everything.

But mainly a special Thanks goes again to Finula, Vanessa, Kerry for getting my mom onto Ward 14 where she wanted to spend her final days.

I will also never forget what Rachel from Ward 14 and Shelly from Ward 16 did today by looking after my mom and taking care of things after she had passed.

Honestly if i can ever do anything to repay any of you, you only ever have to ask

Thank you again
Craig Bougen",5
I would like to give 0 star but there was no option!! Went to A&e around 11:45pm at night with worst ankle sprain. 2 very frustrated nurses told me to come inn and however i was on wheelchair and I couldn’t even step myself without pain. Those 2 nurses accessed me but then refused me for xray and worst part is that they didn’t even gave me single hand to help me walk and forced me to walk all over hospital without wheelchair!!!! I hope those nurses will loose their job someday and feel the same pain i did .,1
"This hospital is not a good hospital
Especially ward 1
Most of the patients have dementia and are talking or screaming overnight
The staff do not care all they are bothered about is how many people are by the bed with the patient.
8 beds in a room and they still think they have no room to do anything.
I figured out that in reality they don't want visitors to see what they do with patients.
That's the reason they want 2 to a bed.
Some staff absolute diamonds but some ignorant especially the asian ones who think they are the bosses even though they just helpers.
Contacted PALS and they don't do anything about it either the matrons don't care either.
Stupid rules and ignorant staff
Do not take any of your family members  and admit them in walsall manor.
Also this hospital is one of the worst hospitals for covid victims.",1
Tax payer money spent on new buildings. Only to be sat at the urgent treatment centre for hours on end.  What an absolute joke. Staff are ridiculously rude and I don’t think these guys understand the meaning of urgent. Why not call it we’ll see after 6 hours centre,1
"I was kept on the ward 29 the staff was soo nice and heplful the gave me a warm welcome yemsis my nurse was fantastic i give her 10/10 the service she had provided for me and the care she has given she always had a smile on her face everytime i called for help the nurses looked after me want to say a big thank you to Dav, sister in charge nana, sarah, alisha, chantelle, fatima, mera, thanks for all the effort they put into me while i stayed there thank you to all the the ward 29 staff  exp-yemsis live u loads sis xxx",5
"THE worst hospital ever. LADIES PLEASE DO NOT GIVE BIRTH HERE!!! My child is left disabled for life thanks to the negligence of this place and the staff. Shocking midwives! First off adding a drip my blood was shooting all over the ceiling and room! But my poor son had a stroke in active labour and they didn’t send me for an emergency section, after they had sent two people to take blood samples from his head while I was 8cm. One of the ‘doctors’ was shaking when she did it which immediately effected his heart rate as she clearly stabbed his brain and killed the whole left side of it!!! Once he was born I was just left on a wing alone unable to get out of bed. They tore my urethra whilst putting a catheter in and had to stitch it back up! They then came hours later and asked if I had fed my baby and I said no hes struggling to latch can anyone help me please and an hour later they bought over a bottle!!!
Disgusting place. Please avoid my friend also had numerous issues whilst in labour.
As this was my first baby, the experience effected me so intensely I have not had anymore children.
I also tried to sue them twice but was told there was no evidence or documents that proved anyone took blood samples from my sons head!",1
"Completely poor management, the whole system is made to be slower, atleast 70 percent of the people who come to ane know what the symptoms are and in need of a prescription,

They could do a quick doctor prescription service based on the people who have had similar symptoms for example if it's asthma and poor breathing 6 hours waiting time to get what you know they will say anyway is what is causing the back log, the put nurses who do a quick check for pointless reasons just thing people can self diagnose the whole system is outdated and I think the top people have designed the system like this so to bring in privatisation.

And even more annoying is the idiots who come.in because of a Cold get over urselfs!",1
"Five stars for the care received - the urology team and nurses working to discharge from urology/the arrivals lounge have been fantastic. Cannot fault the service at all.

Getting to this point, however, has been a bit of a chore - over 18 months on the waiting list, many false starts with wrong appointments and a few wasted journeys - BUT - the important thing is the quality of care received, and it’s been absolutely faultless. Thanks all.",5
"I had my son in Manor hospital on 3rd August.From the time I got pregnant I have been on regular checkup with very sweet staffs who always cleared all my queries and calmed me down.. All the appointments where prebooked and confirmed with our convenience.I had an elective c section which went very smooth as I was prepared well before the surgery during the preOp section.the midwife explained the whole procedure nicely so the next day I was calm .The drs,midwifes,nurses,anesthetic team everyone were very helpful and kind... After the surgery me and my baby were very well taken care of.very happy with Manor hospital . thank you for helping me in every way possible.keep the good work up.",5
"This hospital is shocking, waited 10 hours to see someone.Lots of staff that don't seem to be doing a great deal.",1
"If there was an option for zero stars, the A&E department would definitely get that. People are having to wait 5-10 hours to see a doctor. Elderly people and babies and not made a priority. It’s an actual joke.",1
"Never had a bad experience with the Manor ,ok The old A and E was outdated for amount of patients they received,but this has now been updated to a nearly brand new department which touch wood we as a family haven't had to use yet, Cardiology and Diabetic Foot Clinic deserve special praise as both are fantastic,even to the extent a cardiology surgeon phoned my Dad at home,two days after his pacemaker check to see if he wanted the whole device or just the battery changing,Dad choose just the battery as the device itself dispite being 8 and a half years old is fine just the battery is getting low,Dad now has his appointments for changing the battery within the next 3 weeks which in my opinion is fantastic service given the pressures the NHS face",5
My 19 year old daughter has been in this so called caring hospital environment for 3 weeks the care or rather lack of it is beyond me I've never experienced such appalling care in any other hospital this place needs serious intervention from the cqc there are a small number of good staff but the majority are just not upto the job no one actually listens to the patient or their family what the management are doing is anyone's guess,1
Took my daughter to the urgent treatment centre today with a suspected broken ankle. Had a faultless experience and was out within hour with just a sprain thankfully. The nurses and doctors are terrific and looked after her with genuine care and professionalism.,5
"If this hospital wasn't already bad enough, they can't be arsed to change a date for an appointment that I've waited 2 years for and when I phoned about their mess up to see if it was right or not, I got a load of mouth off the woman on the phone who then started bad mouthing me to her colleagues. Unbelievable.",1
"A&E department was terrible. I took my daughter to hospital because she had a rash that looked like meningitis. We waited nearly 12 hours in A&E. The seats and floor were dirty and some of the chairs were broken. In the whole time we were there we only saw a nurse, who complained about how tired and overworked she was. No doctor in sight. I decided to leave and take my daughter to another hospital.  They saw us within 3 hours.",1
"Got to A and E to take my fiancee as she had a sprained ankle but it was that painful she could not walk on it. Hence the reason we were there to make sure there was no break. Only to find no wheelchairs available, when I said well that is not ideal. The reply was ""well I can't magic one out of thin air"". Luckily I am strong enough to carry her. If that had not been the case we would have had to go to another hospital. Absolutely disgusting service.",1
"This booking a visit on the day is a joke. 40 minutes it takes to get through to be told I need to call back tomorrow. My daughters in hospital and I should be able to turn up. The NHS needs a big shake up

Further update. My daughter is being kept in with baby as they are waiting on blood tests that they say will take around 2 weeks.  They obviously aren't busy and don't need the bed. She is in a side room but they still won't allow 2 visitors for 1 hr leading up to the Xmas period and they won't discharge her.  This hospital has little empathy and the nursing staff are rude and have little care.  Doesn't help when no ones knows what they are doing. So badly run. I was hoping that since they merged with Royal Wolverhampton they would improve I was wrong. Deserves 0 star",1
"I have been in the A and E on the weekend with terible kidney pain and been told that this is just muscle pain in my back despite the fact that I have been repeatedly saying that this is not muscle pain but in fact kidney pain that refused to listen a word I have said so went to another place just to find out I have kidney infection.
They do not really know what are they doing over there.",1
"The best hospital I’ve ever been to!
I had my daughter at manor 6 years ago where the staff were fantastic from appointments to aftercare!
Then last year I had an eptopic pregnancy where I got an appointment with the early pregnancy unit within hours, they were brilliant I have recently contacted them again and been fit in the next day! These staff are rushed off their feet but still give you the best care and reassurance they can
Thank you so much!",5
Yet again in the hospital. Dad has bowl cancer ...he's 90 and needs tablets with his meal ...got his meal but can't eat because they haven't given him the tablets..this happened last time ...why do I have the same issue every time? Ive put complaint in last time stillnofeed back,1
Very very clean and nurses smile and appears to genuinely enjoy their jobs.,5
"I had to discharge myself, I genuinely felt in fear for my life with the ""care"" handed to me by this hospital. First they thought I was a different patient, second I needed to have a CT scan on my neck which the doctors said didn't need bloods taken, the nurse tried to take my bloods and put a catheter in thinking I was a different patient, god only knows what would have happened if they administered anything to me. Thirdly, I had to lay with a neck brace on for 3 hours flat on my back and when telling the nurses I felt sick they handed me a sick bucket but told me not to move. They kept trying to take my temperature and trying to move the neck brace. I had to discharge myself in the end as I said because I genuinely felt in fear for my life! I'd rather suffer with a possible fractured neck than trust this hospital to look after me. I'm going somewhere else",1
"Attitude of some of the nurses are disgusting and make you wonder why they’re even in the profession. Waited about 6 hours to be seen and when asked how long it would take even the receptionist was shocked we were still waiting with the given symptoms we showed up with. Joke of a hospital, do not go here if you want proper care!",1
"I was transferred to this hospital as my local hospital cancelled my surgery, a number of 7 times. Mr Mirza and another surgeon performed my operation. From the beginning and hopefully to the end, I have been treat with the upmost care. This hospital is well and truly like a private hospital, compared to other NHS hospitals I’ve been in.  I have felt safe, in the care of this hospital. If only other hospitals were the same standards x",5
"The prompt care and attention given to my partner throughout his cancer diagnosis was excellent. The medical and nursing teams from the initial walk-in to the urgent care centre, Surgeons, theatre staff,wards 22 and 11 Consultant and all Doctors, Colorectal Nurses.  We thank you with all our hearts.
Your care and knowledge saved a life. So eternally grateful ♥️",5
Attended Walsall Manor hospital ETC this morning. Excellent service yet again!,5
"I wish i could give a 0 0 0 stars. The worst hospital ever. They take advantage of people who don't know much. They manipulate the 18 years old child and get him signed for surgery where they say after oh it was an urine infection. Bastardi. He was alone because they didn't let anyone else be there with him. Now they asking to pay money to get the reports. He still in pain and they just giving him painkillers. We dnt trust them what if they did wrong during surgery and he gets more problem after coming home. This hospital is just making money. Surgeries, c section just makes money. Rubbish and greedy hospital.",1
"10th May 2023 @ 0915. Orthodontic dept.
Went in for dental surgery to remove a awkward tooth. have to say start to finish the dentist was top class. was nervous of going under local anesthetic as perfer general/sedation. She put me at ease talked me through the whole procedure feel very fortunate to have her do my treatment as never experience anything like this at various dentists I have been to in the past. She said I will feel discomfort for a few days. second day and l am fine. no pain just feel abit tender. Sorry I didn't get the dentists name but thank you so much wish all dentists could be like her.
Mrs S Bungar.",5
Thank you Sarah in AMU. You are a true ambassador of the NHS showing real genuine care and compassion and that was really appreciated. Thank you 💕,5
Having treatment at the hospital three times a week and the nurses I see are really friendly and helpful and make you feel at ease.,5
"Krap hospital to call or go to
They switchboard women put you through to different wards if the ward u want doesn't answer simple as that they don't care and its a absolute discrace for the local community and people out of the area.
Definitely would not recommend this krap hospital and definitely would recommend a different hospital as they treat you better and with respect.
$hit hospital.
Update they done surgery on my mum to remove some tumour she couldn't move talk or do anything.
Before surgery she was fine walking on zimmer frame talking fine and active.
After surgery she just went downhill and stayed in this krap hospital for 2 weeks then released but exactly same no walk talk or couldn't do nothing herself then called a ambulance as surgery wound was leaking but they kept her in after waiting 8 hours in A n E
Her organs started failing then the staff at ward 1 and 4 had problems as alot if family members were coming from different country's and city's then sadly my beloved mum passed away.
NEVER GET A LOVED ONE IN THIS SH1T HOSPITAL AND NEVER GET A SURGERY DONE FROM ANY OF THESE SH1T ILLITERATE DOCTORS AND STAFF.
THEY KILLED MY MUM THEY WILL DO THE SAME TO YOUR BELOVED FAMILY MEMBER.
THEY DO NOT CARE AND ONLY WORRY ABOUT THERE BREAK TIMES AND TIMINGS FOR HOME.
SO CALLED DOCTORS WILL TELL UOU EVERYTHING WENT FINE BUT IT WILL BE OPPOSITE.",1
I know it's never going to improve still I put one strar because the waiting time not acceptable even if you go to emergency make sure take breakfast lunch and dinner,1
"Went for a scan which was a pain free examination. However a certain secretary of the main cardiologist (Dr Jaumdally) is next to useless and never answers her phone. I had to use the PALS service to get some answers. Apart from this the hospital has paid parking and is clean enough. It has, as one would expect, handgel located in strategic locations as well as masks at the entrance. The security guard on the 21st March had no idea where the routes are so he is not customer services orientated. Overall its adequate but could be better.",3
"this places need improvement, sorry but that is true, A&E staff reception need to be more open and helps during the visiting this place, nurses need to be more helpful and not ignore the problem or leave someone out of line :(",1
Disgusting. 86 year old mother in law taken by ambulance after fall at home. Discharged same day to us despite immobility and unable to move. Sent home with a commode for us to lift her onto even though we are elderly with health conditions too. Pain relief delivered next day by taxi!!  Readmitted 3 days later by 111 gp but thank goodness ambulance took her to newcross hospital this time and admitted by them where she remains. She has a hairline fracture of her pelvis.,1
"Whilst visiting family in the Walsall area my wife had some medical problems.  We had traveled down from Blackpool and we know A & E is a nightmare, so when I dialed 111 and they said they were sending an ambulance I thought we were in for a long wait as we would in Blackpool.  Ambulance came in about 15 minutes took us to A & E we were booked in and on a bed within 5 minutes looked at and discharged in about another 30 - 40 minutes. Fabulous service, perhaps you should get in touch with Blackpool Victoria Hospital and give them some tips.",5
"Cannot fault the service I got today from the Dr and staff of Cardiac Intervention Suite. I arrived early for my appointment and was treated with respect and good humour all the way through the process of my Angiogram. I can now look forward to an accurate prognosis of my condition, after some sufferance throughout the recent pandemic - normality is slowly returning - well done to all and thank you.",5
"Rang 111 yesterday evening and they advised to go straight to the Urgent Treatment Center in the hospital. Yes, there was a wait but that's to be expected. Saw a lovely Afro-Caribbean nurse who from start to finish of my visit was unbelievably caring. She went above and beyond for me, I could really see the concern towards me. She went out of her way to make sure that my referral was placed as urgent and even made a copy of her own notes for me to take to my next appointment. All nurses should take lessons from this 1 individual. It's never a nice thing to go to hospital but she made it memorable for all the right reasons.",5
Medical care itself was fine. Receptionists in urgent care need a lesson in manners or just generally speaking and acknowledging the person standing in front of them.,2
"Positive -
Great fantastic hospital with great doctors and nurses parking right by the front door with ease into the hospital

Opportunity -
only thing I would say sometimes a bit busy on some days was hard to get a space on some occasions",4
"Just get passed about from pillar to post. Been on waiting list 13 months to have an operation and I am in agony every night having to take co-codamol every night making me very sleepy when I have a toddler and live with him no one else for them to offer me morphine and send me home. This is not treating the issue. This is just prescribing me pain relief when the issue is still going to be there.The nurse said ‘ go to your doctors they are just being lazy’  I was there Friday they took better care of me than the Manor!
How about whilst I’m at the hospital you see to me properly and do your job instead of fobbing me off (again).  Will be using burton from now on. Worth going the bit further for the right care!",1
"New urgent care centre, really nice clean place staff really helpful.",5
"I am waiting to be discharged from ward 20C after being in Ward 10. I have had a full hip replacement after breaking mine on Sat last. The treatment I have received from every member of staff has been exemplary. They are all caring, professional and just make you feel safe and cared about.
From the surgeons, doctors, nursing staff, physio,  occupational therapists cleaners and porters the care and support 100% THANK YOU SO MUCH",5
"I arrived with a 3-month-old girl and I waited more than 3 hours, but they keep telling me that she is a priority. I explained to them that I'm breastfeeding and they don't care, they let adults in who had come after me and they weren't the only emergency room, it's the worst hospital. Don't care about a 3-month-old baby.",1
"Unfortunately I had a terrible experience waited 8 months to be seen and sent away left in I’m pain. Will be taking this further.
The hosptial also needs more to be cleaning done it’s dirty?!
Staff just hanging around in the department doing nothing saying how bored there were very loudly and complaining about their managers. Terrible. We are in a NHS crisis no wonder!! 0/5 if I could",1
Absolut shambles don't even deserve a 1 star don't take your loved ones here for treatment they would have a better chance at a vets,1
"This hospital is good for the right reasons. One problem though, what the F''k is going on with the NHS (despite covid 19). It can also take forever to be seen especially if they're running late.",4
"5 weeks from due date, being told baby is under weight and them wanting regular checks in case baby needs to come early. Only to arrive for a scan to be told that they changed our date of scan and didn’t have time to tell us. Unreal that a hospital can have such little empathy for patients. Not to mention the lady who did our first scan who was rude and unprofessional really gives the nhs a bad name.",1
"The worst hospital ever. Left my 8 month old brother and mother unattended for the majority of the 5 hours visit as he was unwell. Shoved a syringe of medicine down brother’s throat because the nurse was getting impatient as my mum was gently giving it to him at first, and made him throw up. And then left and never returned. They were so eager to get rid of us, and overheard people at reception gossiping about us while we were on our way out. HIGHLY recommend everyone to avoid this hospital. Would not wish this experience on anyone, even to the incompetent people working at this hospital. But karma.",1
"Had a colonoscopy today under sedation. The team were lovely, i was very nervous and all team members put me at ease.
Thank you to Erika Holford, Rosser Ramos, Shukurat Bello. Also to receptionist (curly hair) nurse preparing me and recovery nurse.  Amazing team",5
"This is an older average regional hospital. The information available to patients is very limited,  they do not appear to have a timetable for developing a diagnostic plan, or a treatment plan. Communication form nursing staff is all I am not allowed to say. Communication from the doctors is full of jargon.
The mens' toilets are old, and stink of stale urine instead of bleach and cleaner.",3
"Cardiology ward 7 basically a waiting room for New Cross Hospital may as well go directly to New Cross as you can be held here days and know or be told absolutely nothing

Dr death aka hammarad rude does not give information rather talks about you at next patient’s bed
Dr Wen Joe Chin more explanations of your problems yet jumps at hammards nods. If hammard says jump the sheep who work on cardiac ward say how high!
Hit and miss here especiAly ward 29-who have a habit of losing your meds

A&E always excellent service and staff. Follow up appointments and consultants a waste of time and money on both sides,  with no action taken

Discharge lounge hours plus to get out 0 out of 10

All in all go to New Cross or QE for outstanding performance rather than here

The manor has really hit bottom over the last decade",2
My husband sent for the ambulance after I had a fall at home. The paramedics were very professional and decided I needed an Xray so took me to hospital. The care I got was second to none. Everyone was very kind and professional. Every step of my treatment was explained to me and I was eventually discharged home with pain killers and a frame. I would like to thank everyone involved for their help.,5
Can not believe I've been discharged from the cardiologist department despite having a ongoing heart problem. All because 1 I did not want to attend a group call to discuss my personal business. And 2 because I had to cancel an ask to rearrange a face to face appointment due to no transportation. Iam mentally unwell I can't attend alone . disgusting,1
"Absolutely disgusting!
I had taken my son of 10 months for an on going issue, been in A&E since 5pm finally they came to give him some ibuprofen at 9:30pm and I was told the doctor would come to see my son and evaluate everything and come up with a plan with in 15-25 minutes, yet to be told at 12:30am that we can just go home and that he doesn’t need to be sitting here! And that the doctor doesn’t need to see him! Disgusting that they would let a 10 month old baby Sit in A&e waiting to see someone and then just tell them to go home! Fuming will not be taking my son here again!",1
Very long waiting time at emergency. One toilet for one ward. Unprofessional doctors. Rude nurses and they just want to get rid load and would discharge patient without complete treatment and suggest to contact GP for further investigation. Very poor service,1
"Hi,wenlt to hospital for an absys, wasn't sure it was an absys but was told by dentist I had to go to a&e, built up courage got there and they just turned me away, no examination  nothing, so I'm at home with a massive lump on my face, nhs staff want a rise, what for",1
"Diabetic eye screening
Waste of time, 3rd world countries have far far better service than this, over 2 hours of waiting and no sign of anyone seeing me yet, why do they give appointments if they don't understand time. My appointment was for 9.45 am and it's now 11.45 am, I enquired twice within that time and on both the occasions l was told to wait, one can understand if the clinic was busy but they were not on this occasion, useless staff and waste of public money. Clearly a  mismanagement problem here. These people should be paid  according to how many patients they see and then you would notice the difference.",1
"DIRTY! slow and and rude staff.
I hope I never have to go here again. The waiting room was full of cigarette butts dried leaves and a general sir of neglecte. The wait time was average of 2 1/2 hours. I had gone in with chest pain and left after 2 hours as I couldn't stand the dirt any longer. I will go to my GP when they open. It felt like an eastern block medical center, not a western hospital.",1
"Bad experience with staff when trying to book an appointment left feeling anxious, worried and looking to go private. My experience with Dermatology today. Serious communication issues patients should feel better after speaking to a hospital not nervous. No care given to me what so ever despite me explaining my worries over the phone.",1
"My 87yr old mum was admitted to the Manor following a nasty fall. It took 24hrs for a drink of water and nearly 2 days for a bed pan. They showed no compassion, no care, and no people skills and hardly anyone can communicate or converse in a way that you can understand. Nobody there was willing to administer basic needs and often she was left in a degrading situation which no human being should ever be put through. Worst of all, on leaving, she had no discharge note, no doctor sign off and no pain killers. Do yourself and your loved ones a favour and go somewhere else.",1
I have never experienced something so unreal in my life. Having my wife’s waters break we arrived at Walsall manor hospital to be told out baby is not ready to be delivered and was sent home to then my wife being in so much pain and unbeknown To me that I would be delivering the baby at our home. Thankfully paramedics turning up in less than 10 mins of call to make sure baby was in good health. I never got the names of the midwife but I can assure you that the African lady at front desk really let the ward down and if I knew her name she would definitely be put out there so people can avoid,1
Went to have my knee checked over after it going on me . For all the nurse to do is squeeze my ligament and say yeah that’s not good . I was going to put you in a splint but I’m not going to asked for the reason she rolled her eyes . Ended up walking out and going to new cross where they actually was more considerate had a x ray to find a lot more damage has been done . Never going back to the manor,1
"My adult daughter received cancer treatment. From Clatterbridge hospital in Liverpool 5*+. Also Liverpool women's hospital 5*+, Liverpool Royal hospital 1*.
Walsall Hospital 5*+. Because she is now on ward Merlin waiting to be transferred to a ward. The full health team are attentive at all times 24hr. The ward team are always professionals. Their sense of humour relievers some of the stress off my daughter and other's on the ward.
What I have wrote is in relation to my daughter in fear of her life.Due to having a collapsed large bowel.Due to the radiation therapy that saved her life.",5
So much staff yet your waiting ages and the pharmacy is even worse. Waited nearly 1 hour for prescription . The service is not fit for purpose. They keep you longer waiting to make money off car parking charges .crooks nhs needs reforming,1
"People’s days are often bad already having to go to the hospital. We would at least want some comfort and warm welcoming from the staff, but instead all I got was unpleasant experience going here.
The worst hospital I’ve been to so far. I would love to give this 0 stars if I could…
The receptionist is SO disrespectful and rude. I went to the A&E hoping to get my daughter diagnosed. I was asked to give my daughter’s name so I gave it her. She asked me to spell it out so I did, she didn’t even bother to listen and tried blaming it on me saying how I didn’t say it. She also asked irrelevant questions like “was your daughter even born here?” How is that going to help???? Like I would expect them asking stuff like “when was your daughter’s date of birth?”.
The doctor and nurse were alright, but compared to the hospitals in Wiltshire, they don’t give enough care towards their jobs.
Especially, I hope that receptionist fixes her attitude.",1
"Have to go for regular checks for I,c,d. Find the nurse very professional and helpful.",5
"This hospitals funding should be revoked with immediate effect, this hospitals A&E is by far the worse in UK. After being involved in an RTA where I injured my head first a doctor tried to tell me by looking at me, I was fine and there didn't require my head examined to establish the fact, and that I should go home, had to put my feet down before I was giving a ct scan after waiting 4 hours.

I was then made to wait another 4 hours a total of 8hours waiting at the A&E only to be told they didn't have any doctors available to read my ct scan to establish if I  had internal head bleed or not, they show total luck of care and respect to thier patients, I would vote in a heart beat to have this hospital completely scrapped.",1
"I was taken by ambulance, after fantastic care by the two paramedics, to Walsall Manor Ambulatory care on Sunday July 3rd.2022  . I have nothing but praise for EVERYONE who treated. I was scared as I has breathing difficulties , swollen ankles and very high BP. All the staff were kind , compassionate, professional and gentle. I had  to visit again the next day and has just the same care and  conpassion. Treat people how you would like to be treated,it does help. Thank you to everyone ! Sue.",5
"Pathetic service. Waiting for child with hi temp and weird rash to be seen. Receptionists have changed, nurses and doctors have changed since been here as have most patients. Being non urgent really means waiting till your dead before they decide to see you",1
"Cannot fault the care my son received at WMH today. We are so grateful to all the Doctors and Nurses who looked after him (and me while I blubbed). From the first assessment in a&e, to seeing the Doctor, having surgery and then recovery, he was treated with kindness and had everything explained to him.",5
"Cannot fault the care I received from staff on Route 201. From the minute I arrived I was kept informed of everything that was happening. The anaesthetist (Mr Mo?) could see I was very nervous, as could the surgeon, and went out of his way to put my fears to rest. The aftercare I received, especially from Jamie, was sensitive and sympathetic. Thank you for looking after me so well.",5
Primary care for OAPs is ok.Aftercare is dreadful. Pain management non existent. They will virtually discharge your octogenarian parents whilst still on the operating table given half a chance. Communication with family ZERO even if you tell them your folks are ancient and can't remember anything. AVOID AVOID AVOID. Go to New Cross. Or anywhere that doesn't have the letters M A N O R in it's name.,1
"Attended today (Saturday) for a CT scan. Lady on reception very polite and helpful, Zain who attended to me with my 1litre of water, very polite and again very helpful. Male who called me in for CT was lovely, chatty and professional. Following my CT scan female member of staff was polite and helpful also. Had a 15 minute wait post scan and Zain removed my cannula without any problems. In and out in just over an hour, can not fault the service or people today. If I really had to make a suggestion I’d say ask people to drink the water prior to their appointment to reduce the waiting time. Otherwise a really really positive experience. Thank you so much. You’re doing an amazing job, please keep up the high standards and stay safe x",5
"I had never been to A&E here so thought as I come under Walsall I would try it on this occasion as I needed to be seen. All was well with me I'm glad to say. But I was shocked with the service as soon as I was moved to assessment unit from getting biscuits water a sandwich and crisps, and I was seen in under 3 hours, everyone was lovely and professional.",5
"I had 2 children here with the best possible care but my more recent experience was god awful. Honestly I wouldnt put anyone through the rudness of staff the appalling waiting conditions, lack of care lack of patience. They need to build another hospital close or have a very close look at whats going on there. I was in a&e with a stomach ulcer after being sent away from them 5 times previously with the same condition. Blood in vomit and non stop vomiting and a heart rate over 150!! 10 hours I was expected to wait in a&e. A man in front soiled himself and walked it all around the a&e and nothing was done even though it was all over the floor and people were complaining. He even told a doctor before my eyes and was shunned off. They are not coping at all and I really believe they are putting peoples lives at risk. It really needs looking in to. I was appalled. Compared to my experience there 5 years prior, its deteriorated unrecognisabley. Sad but true! After waiting 10 hours I was fobbed off with tablets by a doctor called Rory for ulcers even though they didn't do any real checks. They made my situation worse and I'm now in another hospital getting proper care and treatment.  This whole experience is quite scary as its my local hospital and I don't think they are capable of caring for people anymore. Something really needs to be done. 10 hours in pain after being rushed in by ambulance is not acceptable but then to be fobbed off after the wait. Ridiculous. The staff were completely over run but very rude also. I met 1 nice lady and even she seemed to run off after telling me she would get me help. They are not coping. If you want good care do not go here.",1
Appointment today 21/6/23..ECG + Echocardiogram..all the staff were extremely friendly & helpful..well done Manor Hospital for employing such wonderful people...,5
"I would love to give this hospital zero stars but that’s not possible so I’ll have to give it one. My Grandma has been there a month and has had nothing but awful care from day 1. The nurses have been rude and disrespectful. No one knows what they’re doing. Instead of telling us they don’t know what’s wrong, they keep making different diagnoses and changing the diagnosis everyday. We have a long list of complaints regarding the awful standard of care my grandma has received. I will never ever come to this hospital or recommend it to anyone.",1
I’ve just spent a week on ward 12 and then ward 11. Fantastic care from all members of staff but would like to give a special shout out to HCSW Charlotte on ward 12 and HCSW Leigh on ward 11 who both made my hospital stay much more comfortable.,5
"One of the worse hospitals ever. The care appears to be getting better but the management appears lacking. I have no idea what strategy they have in place to move from needing improvement  but it's not working. Clean sweep needed. I say this as the problems we have had with communication  such as getting through to book visits, getting through to the wards etc remain the same as  before covid, so can't  even say decline down to pandemic.  Just more of the same",1
I went to the early pregnant unit (ward 23) in 5th week of pregnancy with bleeding. The staff took care of me as soon as I got there. Every time when i called them with any problem they always was helpful and do any examination what needed to be done. Even after lost my pregnant they was so sorry for me and offered mental help. Any of the staff members was always so nice and helpfully. The ward is also clean. I cant say any bad word. Thank you so much for take care of me and for talking to me when things went wrong.,5
"Went in last Monday for a simple minor problem. Ended up spending nearly a week in hospital. Got sent home on the weekend but still waiting for my medication and my discharge papers. Some of the nurses were lovely but the worst time for bad nurses was the night time. The last night in hospital there was this one nurse and she wasn't very nice. I had requested a doctor 5 times that night and the nurses wouldn't listen to me. This one nurse literally had a go at me for requesting a doctor.

Walsall Manor Hospital has failed me in so many different ways. I went to Urgent Treatment Centre for piles and ended up being hospitalised for something completely different. Yet no one actually treated my piles and now I'm at home with the same pain that I was in when I went to the Urgent Treatment Centre. I feel like I've been let down by the NHS. Now I have to be uncomfortable in my own bed because I still have the same problem.

Walsall Manor Hospital needs to treat all the ailments people come in with not just pick and choose which ailments to treat.

I am fed up with having piles and not being able to sit down without pain.",2
"Yesterday I was referred to the SACU unit with glandular fever where I believe I was dealt with mainly by Danielle and Mel. They were so lovely and extremely caring and helpful. I often avoid doctors and hospitals because of past, unpleasant experiences but I felt these two girls deserved a big shout out. Thank you both so much for all your help, you’re amazing at your jobs and absolute stars!

"I have had the misfortune of being forced to use this hospital for many years, but recent events have pushed me to a point where I can no longer keep quiet about how atrocious this hospital is.
In June I went to A&E with a large swelling in my neck and unable to open my mouth beyond a few millimeters - as a type 1 Diabetic I was concerned I could not properly feed myself beyond soup and yogurt, affecting my bloodsugar readings. The Doctor refused to even examine me, saying I should go see my dentist instead (which I had already done and told her so). It turned out it was an abscess that had gone septic and a few days later I was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment at the much superior New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton. Having apparently been very close to dying I attempted to track down the doctor at Walsall Manor to complain about her conduct but inconveniently any record of mine at A&E had 'vanished' and there was no way to lodge a complaint without a name.
Then in July, just over a month later, after returning from a family trip I became rapidly and incredibly ill within a matter of hours of returning home. I had had a cold the previous week but the symptoms were very similar to those I had experience with my sepsis, and only being a month since that situation I was concerned I had relapsed. The Ambulance crew asked me the same questions repeatedly despite my inability to breathe, one absolutely butchered my hand putting a cannula in (I am used to needles and cannulas and I have never had such a painful attempt to put one in before) and at the Hospital, before any tests had been conducted, the doctor (who had the bed side manner of a house brick) told me that I had Covid-19, repeatedly, which naturally made me incredibly worried for my family. I was then forced to walk to the ward where I collapsed due to no support and being unable to breathe properly and to top it all off the nurses were often rude to me and other patients from what I could hear of their conversations.
However, finally after a PCR test, x-ray and blood test I was given the all-clear for Covid-19 and instead was diagnosed with a localized infection in my lung (much to my relief!). So I had spent upwards of 4 hours in a stressful state for no reason thanks to the doctor who just assumed I had Covid rather than wait to see the results of my tests before jumping to conclusions.
I was promptly booted out of the hospital at 4am, which I had neither the strength nor the desire to argue over as I just wanted to get away from that place.
I implore any of you who have an option to choose what hospital you go to, DO NOT choose this hospital! I have used the services of a number of hospitals in my life, and by far this hospital is the single worst place I have ever been treated at.",1
"I have had many appointments and even been on the ward for gastric bypass. Each time has been a good experience, staff are so helpful and attend to all needs.. The Dr Khan was so nice he went through everything thoroughly and considered my needs, worries and concerns.  No operation is expected to be brill but I had no after effects it went perfect so 10 stars to Walsall  Mannor their weight management team and all nurses throughout the hospital. Thank you for being so efficient and caring.",5
Went at 2 o'clock in the morning they where so helpful at the A+E they treated me well and were really reassuring about what was going on was told 4 hours wait but got in within half hour and was home by half four. Which from what they have to do and the amount of people they see I feel is pretty good well done Walsall,5
"Avoid this hospital at all costs.
Neglect isnt the word that i am going through with these lot.
I have no trust in this hospital whatsoever anymore.

Updated 9/11/22
Now this hospital has emerged with New Cross hospital they are now sending patients over to cannock for ct scans n xrays!!..after a phonecall explaining im very ill and cant travel far i was told ""to get the train""...whats the point in having a local hospital when theyre sending you here there and everywhere for scans!!

Updated 19th jan 2023...
After losing all trust in this hospital n the lack of care...i have now transferred all my care over to another hospital.

Shame on you manor hospital!!",1
This place is horrible been sitting in a&e for over an hour and they didn’t even help the gentleman who was bleeding out. Horrible place never come here,1
"Cannot reach by phone, 3 days 10+ calls hours spent.

Switchboard ignored my question and just continued to dial out.",2
"Waiting in ward 15 to take my mother in law home. She was told 2 hours before we arrived that she could come home but had to wait for Pharmacy. We had been here 40min and was told ""I will just send for your meds from the pharmacy. So 2 hours & 49 minutes after being told she could go home! Been told that we can come back later but this really is not practical. When I asked how long the wait would be it was a straight don't know! As if they didn't care and almost as it it's not their problem! The whole system needs a shake up!",1
"I went in for gastric surgery that had been delayed 2yrs because of covid and it was all a bit of a rush (which I'm glad of). From start to finish the team at Walsall Manor were fantastic - thorough, informative, friendly, helpful and very good at their jobs. Thank you Mr Mirza and the surgery staff, the brilliant nurses, the lady who brought round the hot drinks, and everyone else that helped me. Thank you",5
"Doctors,nursesplus staff were excellent.good catering facilities for refreshments. Plenty toilets to use and spotlessly clean. Masks and hand cleansing available on enter. Good car park but the cost of parking is atrocious and disgusting pricing. People come here or bring others for treatment or visit the sick.not visiting 5 star entertainment in. London.Do something about it. This is a brilliant hospital,don't tarnish it with overpriced parking.",4
"The visiting system is ridiculous.  2 visitors for 1 hour a day. Patients are worried and stressed,  and relatives are only allowed in for 1 hour, not much time to reassure people.  The booking system is difficult to get through to at times, yesterday I waited nearly an hour for my call to be answered,  another relative was hanging on for over an hour. The whole visiting system is stressful for all concerned,  and I'm.sure doesn't help patients mental health and wellbeing. I know there has to be some restrictions,  but this seems very harsh. I have emailed the chief executive to express my concerns.",1
"Just overall terrible services off a few departments. Not happy at all basically been left to slowly die, in pain everyday nothing being done and in the past they even lost my hospital documents! Ive had enough hopefully i have better luck at new cross.",1
"This hospital is a disgrace 😤 my mom has been been waiting on appointment since February and every month she has a letter saying we have had to change your appointment to a different date which is the next month. So today this is the 8th letter she has received... plus this appointment is only for a telephone chat first.
It's disgusting you telling me that this consultant can't pick up a phone and make a call for ten minutes. Yes understand they are busy due to covid and other things but come on we are in September now and her new appointment is for November now ... its disgusting makes me angry and sounds to me even if you was dying they wouldn't care.",1
"Had to spend a couple of days at the AMU. I would like to thank nurses Kim, Gemma, Emily and Sily. Also thanks to student nurse Melissa and the Doctor Molly and nurses Oscar, Megan and Rea from A&E. You were all lovely to me and you treated and looked after me very well.",5
"Giving five star not to the hospital but to Anita - one of the doctors whos seen me in Urgent Treatment Centre.
My blood pressure was super high but after she examined me and talked to me I felt little bit better and even the pressure has gone down 👍🏼 Many thanks",5
"The best hospital in the west Midlands, the staff on the maternity ward and delivery unit are the most amazing staff .
The care that we received in labour and after care from the moment we got there is out of this world.
I can honestly say that this hospital is doing something right .
The  trust should be so proud of the staff they are on another level .
We had a plan in place and they went above and beyond the plan , can't thank you enough !
Especially in lockdown, for them nothing has changed they are doing an outstanding job.
Thank you again .",5
"A&E-  What a place. - 03/04/22

Went back today 06/04/22
The girls in the childrens A&E are fabulous. My original visit was after 6 pm on Monday I stayed till gone 11pm and gave up. Today I went in at just turning 11 am and so much better. Lovely experience. Reassured and didn't feel like a bother at. The girls on Monday we're ran off their feet. The whole of A&E was manic. If I have to go again I will leave it until morning if possible rather than tea time.",3
"This hospital needs new management....!
No excuse for poor care and rude nurse and over work consultants who work 2 or 3 hospital for extra cash. Its dirty and smell in toilets. Staff are poor hygiene smell of bo. No excuse for long lost covid. We in 2022 all needs to clean up and train staff and are consultants work one job not 1x at 3 places. Walsall hospital Give your staff free soap and mouthwash.",1
We would like to thank Dr Rumi Jaumdally for yet again saving the day and going above and beyond in caring for my partner Ian Hassell. If only all the department's were as good as yours. Thank you for everything.,5
I think it was very unprofessional manner hospital nurse was handing out tablets and he was giving a man paracetamol when he already had it sorry to say Nice nurses very helpful I just thought the practice was very impressional,1
"First off, I have the utmost respect for our emergency services and NHS. I they have very difficult jobs most of the time thankless. But and it's a big but. Quite a few of the staff at The Manor I have found really aren't bothered. A few are exceptional. There is a big guy in SAU who when he dealt with me was chatty, pleasant and just seemed to be a decent bloke. Well done that man and I'm sorry I don't know your name. They really need to do something with UTC. The waits can be horrendous and it's right at the back of beyond. A&E is the same. It's like no-one is particularly bothered. Get it sorted and put your patients first. Get them in, get them sorted and if possible back out the door.",3
STILL doing virtual appointments! Dr’s never call on time and then when they do eventually call you can hardly hear or understand them. If the staff are going to insist on calling patients instead of seeing them F2F then at least make sure the call can be heard clearly! And cardiology should not be assessing patients over the phone when that patient is recovering from a heart attack.,1
"A big thankyou to the MRI team at Walsall Manor. I have visited twice now for an MRI scan and was very poorly on one account. Due to their patients, professionalism and good communication as a team I was able to receive my scans despite my clostophobia. The scans were performed in an efficient, effective and very caring manner well done and keep up the good work.",5
"I had a procedure carried out at the Surgical Outpatients Department (Route 201) on Monday 7th October 2019.  The staff on the department gave excellent care, was very understanding to my apprehension whilst waiting for my operation. The consultant Mr Ral was very informative regarding my procedure and very understanding that I was very frightened.  The anaesthetic team were fantastic, they put me at ease as best they could and reassured me until I was asleep.  Overall the whole experience was handled with great care and I would like to thank all of the staff for the excellent treatment.",5
I contacted maternity triage regarding my situation and I am truthfully disgusted by their behaviour. Their patient care does not exsit it is shocking to wonder how they became midwives. I will be lodging a formal complaint.,1
"Absolutely poorly run and have been involved in very many lawsuits due to their improper care leading to people dying. One of my relatives used to work as a doctor at Manor and she told us never to use the hospital as they don’t know what they are doing and kill people due to their incompetence.

I used to visit this hospital until I got tired of being messed around by incredibly long waiting times, rude doctors who dismiss your concerns, and other issues. I also had surgery here and they butchered me leaving me with chronic pain and nerve damage due to poor surgical technique (they slipped and cut me and failed to tell me about it until I ended up in A&E 1 day later). Also, after my operation they failed to get my pain killers ready so I was crying in pain for 2 days until they had done so. At that point, I had become delirious with pain and managed to get some strong pain medicines from a friend.

I recommend that all read the CQC report before visiting the manor. I’ll summarise it, the hospital is rated as “unsafe” and “needs improvement”. Word of advice, visit New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton instead, much much better and the staff there genuinely care about you!",1
"It's known as one of the worst hospitals in England for a reason. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant,she was feeling unwell and they told her to go in. They sat us on a plastic chair in a random hallway for over 7 hours. In the end we got up and left. The place needs knocking down and building up from the bottom. I can't put into words how badly the place is run.",1
"The secretary for the ENT department is absolutely vile to patients, every single time I have spoke to her she gives nothing but attitude all I was trying to do was return a phone call that I had missed and it only would of been from ENT department because my appointment was yet again cancelled with no explanation, she speaks to me with attitude and tells me it wouldn’t of been from her, who else would it of been then!? Who even hires these kind of people!",1
Treated fantastically from paramedics to discharge. Thanks.,5
The staff at walsall Manor is amazing because when I had heart attack and was admitted to hospital first the ambulance staff was really really helpful and caring but when I got admitted to hospital the staff was so caring makes me so proud of them. I would like to say Thank you so much to all the staff who looked after me I know this review is little late cuz I was in hospital in middle of Corona but staff made me feel so comfortable so thank you so much again xx,5
"Visited the urgent care centre today and can't fault them the dr in there was very thorough and didn't hesitate to contact the heart department and ask them to check me over. Went to the heart department and I can't fault them I was in bloods taken ecg done and results back quickly before being saw by a lovely dr who was happy for me to go home as everything was good.
I know hospitals don't always do good but personal experience today was excellent.",5
"I wish to congratulate the whole staff of the Day Centre 201 for the treatment I received yesterday the 21st May 18. There was nothing but pleasantness from the early morning greeting from reception to the discharge nurse.  I was put completely at ease by all members of staff and every procedure was explained fully and with patience. The highlight of my day was following, 3 steps behind, the anaesthetist to her consultation room, wishing the corridor was a mile long. (No, I'm not a dirty old man, well, maybe just a little).
So Thank you to Mr. S Ganta Consultant and his wonderful staff.
A very satisfied patient.",5
"My step daughter got told to go to the hospital yesterday 15th May and go to ward 22 to get her problem sorted and it's 10.30 am the next day and she's still waiting to be seen this is a disgrace and the best bit she isn't even in a bed she's been sat in a chair all night got woken up for a scan and because her bladder wasn't full she's been sent away and told to wait until 2.45 pm I can't believe how bad they are treating my step daughter, she is in pain and she's told the nurses and they've done nothing get it sorted walsall manor and also I've just spoken to her and she was told she would get some breakfast she didn't get a thing so she hasn't eaten since yesterday morning it's not on",1
The worst hospital ever. I got treated worse than an animal. I was threatened if I was to report. Would rather not go back there.,1
"Fantastic service with partner to be seen in A&E for a potential fracture. Thankfully, it was just a sprain. In and out in 3 hours. You can't ask for more than that, thank you to the excellent team at A&E.",5
"If i could i would have given 0 star! The urgent treatment care is awful!!!! I went today for my little one he had priority and I waited 6 hours!!!!!!! My son was really bad and they couldn’t do anything!  I have the worst experience !!!!
Waiting time was 1 hour and I waited 6 hours! So fair !! 👏👏",1
This has.got to be the worse hospital in the whole of the midlands. You induced my wife early due to mistakes made. Then ends up in neonatal with sepsis my wife then gets sepsis. So one dirty infection riddled hospital. You put my son on antibiotics told to come back when he was 6 weeks old for a scan on his kidney. Near on 4 months later still waiting for a scan. You have him on antibiotics for a infection you have no idea has cleared up or if his kidney is any better. But yet keep him on these antibiotics which got be doing more damage than good. Your a waste of tax payers money. You should be ashamed to call yourself a hospitaland most your nurses are horrible and have the compassion of a cochroach,1
"I gave 5 star for the maternity part , I had my baby there last week and the standard or care and professionalism was amazing. Every single midwife was lovely , caring and really took an interest in me. Very pleased! Keep up the good work.",5
"Tried numerous times to get through to ward 3 to find out how my father was. Joke! No one answers the phone. The left hand does know what the right hand is doing! Total waste of time. When I do get through eventually I am told he’s doing well and ok, only to be told later that he isn’t well at all! What the heck is happening to our NHS???",1
"What an absolute joke! Would have thought a walk in centre wouldn't take as long as A & E but sat here now and have been for 3.5hrs!!!  Was told 2.5hrs wait and half an hr ago told I would go in after the next 2 people and asked now being as its been 3.5hrs and all the receptionist can say is ""you'll be going in very soon"". I might aswell have gone into A & E!!!",1
"Maternity ward have been cold and shown little care throughout our pregnancy. Can only be compared to getting treatment in deep Soviet Russia. No one knows what they're doing nor do they want to help you. You're not a person here, you're definitely a tick in a box. Recent surprise CQC inspection highlights this. Thankfully we were able to give birth at New Cross and it was amazing.",1
"If I could give zero stars I would. Ward 2 at the Manor Hospital was a disgrace. Lack of the absolute basics like feeding and bathing patients. My Grandad went into that ward and within under 2 months lost 3 stone. Caught infection after infection.. Sepsis, MRSA.. They have sped up his deterioration hugely. They lied on the notes to say they had checked on him and treated him when they hadn't. Didn't move him so now he has severe, deep tissue damage bed sores. Other families on the ward had the same issues and had put complaints in. Patients left sat covered in their breakfast until families arrived in the evening to clean them up. Avoid this place like the plague.",1
"A very very busy hospital. A&E is typically a 4 - 6 hour wait.

Staff are polite and very helpful but waiting in A & E for so long with people intoxicated from drink and all types of other things is painful - but I guess that is the same no matter what hospital you go to for an emergency.

Two of kids were born there and the maternity section and staff were exceptional. Strict visiting times but fair.",3
"Woke up unable to get to work last Wednesday with a big red rash on my right leg & taken to Walsall Minor by my friend.

Friendly and courteous treatment right from the beginning, admitted to A.M.U within three hours of arrival where cellulitis due to infection was diagnosed.

I cannot fault the kindness and care I was shown by every nurse and doctor here, they checked my right foot in X–Ray no problems when I said it seemed unduly painful last Saturday morning and reassured me nothing was broken!

Five Stars to everyone in AMU, Ward 16, the X Ray Imaging Centre and the Discharge Lounge  Ward 8 for caring for me right up until my friend came!

There was one very noisy dementia patient on the ward unfortunately, but the staff treated him with courtesy at all times and regularly moved patients around the ward so no one had to put up with this chap's shouting all the time!

Only slight grumble is so much of the hospital is a 'fone dead spot!

Chris Williams",5
"My baby son was born here on the 8th
January. I am not normally the one to write things, however when credit is due, it's important for feedback.
We were taken care of by the most amazing set of midwives in the country,  the best of the best. Each and everyone of them that crossed paths with us during our visit were 100% top of there game.
Each and everyone of them you could tell loved there jobs and total professionalism was absolutely evident.
I would like to give a big thank you to a lovely lady called Siljia. She was our midwife during the final phase, she was absolutely incredible. Manor Hospital  is lucky to have such professional staff such as her. People like her are what make a good hospital a Great hospital. Many thanks to them all.",5
This place is terrible the nurses and staff are rude and leave patients in bad condition in the waiting room,1
Ten years this week since I had ankle surgery under doctor goswami 'ankle specialist' and am now virtually a cripple thanks to him. Don't know if he has retired yet but would like him to know that he has ruined my life when he messed up in the surgery and then washed his hands of me when he realised that he had got it wrong. Hope to be able to walk again one day. Happy anniversary eh😭,1
"Abysmal treatment on the birthing wards. Staff inexperienced/lacked knowledge, no one knew the answers to questions asked.
One of the midwives said she was happy for birth to happen in the observation area, that tells you all you need to know.

Years ago, waited hours in A&E, doctor saw me for 20 seconds, told me to take it easy and rest. Next day I was admitted with a serious muscle infection in my chest. The consultant actually laughed that the previous Doctor had missed it.

Not a great place to receive care.",1
Can’t say this is completely a poor hospital. There are many tired looking but pleasant staff. Many working over and doing bank shifts. All staff were calm. The hospital is clean. The down side: Poor communication between medical and nursing staff with regards to individual patient care. Patients left second guessing about what’s happening. Advised to ask the doctor or speak to consultant secretary that you can’t through to. Medical notes lost on 2 occasions. Unsafe transfer due to lack of information. NG tube causing pressure ulcer in this day and age? Not sure nurses realise this should be given the same thought processes as pressure ulcer prevention for someone on bed rest. Anticoagulation over looked. Some wards lacking basic equipment like drip stand resulting in drips hung off curtain rail and other make shift things. One ward not lending another an ECG machine because it take too long for it to be returned. Wheels loose on bed side locker causing it to tip up when moving. Unhelpful parking attendant. In summary I observed the care of a parent on several occasions over the last year. I knew they were looked after in a basic way and chose not to challenge the things I saw for fear of impacting on their care. I kept my eye on the priority aspects of their care and had to watch the pressure ulcer develop. What has happened to the fundamentals of caring in this hospital? Hoping you can get it right soon and that my parent and myself are not put in this uncomfortable position again.,3
"Took my 81 year sister to the Manor hospital yesterday, walked through main reception looked for hand gel. NONE went  up excavator looked on  the walls all the way to appointment area looked on reception desk there None. Why is this not around the hospital to try and help stop infections spreading.. Unbelievable....",3
"Involved in an accident on the M6 motorway on the 16th.December and taken to Walsall Manor Hospital. The hospital was extremely busy but my wife and I received thorough ,efficient care and attention .we were both very impressed with the efficiency and friendliness of the staff. Everyone from the receptionists,nurses,nursing assistants and doctors were pleasant to deal with and very helpful. Special thanks to Nicki and her team in room 235 for their help with ""Jackie"",I don't know how we would have managed without them. Best wishes for 2017 from Paul and Margareta Morgan and Jackie O.",5
Arrived on a Wednesday night with a child and a pretty empty waiting room. Had to wait nearly 4 hours to see a doctor! Didn't get home until 4am! The service is always so slow it feels like everyone's asleep. I'd rather drive an extra hour to the next hospital .,1
I don't think I would of give 1 if it wasn't for the fact that I wouldn't be able to write a review. The neglect I have suffered over the last 4 weeks is something I wouldn't want anyone else to go through. To being told I will be fast tracked for operation and then finding out I was never on list anyway for operation . To 4 weeks later trying after numerous phone call and trying to sort to feeling that I'm never going to get anywhere. I advice people stay clear and go somewhere else if you can.,1
It's Tracy Mortiboy I came in hospital Wednesday afternoon everyone in a and e was amazing and 12 30 on night went up to ward 22 where you go before op I came in with very bad pain in stomach diabetes key tone levels were very high all nurses looked after me were fantastic they couldn't do enough for you thank you so much to them all I got have gorbladder out I came home Christmas eve night with antibiotics pain killers so wait for op now so thank you again to all lovely staff,5
"My 94 year old mother was admitted and while there contracted Covid 19 (positive test yesterday). They are now discharging her! Family have been waiting seven hours for her to arrive but the ambulance went to the wrong address so they cancelled my mum's drop and have taken her back to hospital. Last time she was discharged they took her to the wrong address; shouldn't be surprised as they keep getting her name wrong. Total shambles, an excuse of a hospital.",1

"having spent 2 weeks in this hospital with a very bad infection, I was ready to discharge myself on day 14! the quality of the care from the the bottom of the staff chain to the top, was utterly abysmal! I felt as though I was abroad, in a third world country.. I would rather die at home, in agony, than ever be admitted to Walsall Manor Hospital again! disgusting facility!",1
"Having called 111 and there being no other open   Out of hours GP facility I was sent to ‘urgent care’ at the manor hospital. A&E was empty, the urgent referral unit was heaving with people from babies to pensioners. I spent 3 hours waiting to be seen, I was NOT triaged at A&E or in the urgent referral unit, just told to wait to be seen. As my condition and that of others got progressively worse ( I was passing blood.) the staff seemed not to have any system (or inclination) to expedite matters. The doctor I saw was excellent, showed empathy and importantly diagnosed and prescribed medication. This review is NOT about staff it’s about a failing system potentially putting lives at risk. This unit is understaffed, over used and not fit for purpose. The people of Walsall deserves better.",1
"Had to take my elderly father to emu dept route 233 today and never before have I felt the need to leave a review
Although we had a lengthy wait we were so well looked after ! The whole team we had contact with were so caring and professional
I would like to praise Dr Senna she is so lovely  and a nurse named Loveth she was so caring and attentive
Thank you all so much",5
"Thorough, prompt service. I felt truly spoilt. A and E care long but very good care. Ward 11, staff attentive, polite and caring. Information given every step of the way. The doctors and nursing team so impressive. Hardworking nursing staff presented themselves in a friendly, cheerful manner. Thank you so much. 10/10 and the same! House keeping girls second to none, food was really good plenty of choice great job thank you.",5
"I have just taken my father out of the hospital after two weeks, ignorer to get him to a doctor who can diagnose his problem. I welcome the extensive tests that were carried out on my father and the excellent nursing he received. I feel the doctors did not listen to me. And if you do not listen you cannot help. My father has an infection that keeps coming back and is treated with antibiotics. He also is also in the early stages of dementia. The two are clearly a separate issue but the medical team were (unlike previous medical teams) unable to see past the dementia. In the end I decided it would be better to take my father out of the hospital for treatment. I am disappointed as the hospital is very clean, well run and well staffed.",3
"so far 40 minutes late of an appointment, we arrived 20 minutes before the appointment dhouldve started making it an hour of waiting, uncontrolled kid keeps screaming and its triggering my autism. Please, god, help this hospital",1
NHS is so terrible. I’ve been waiting for 7 hours just to be told my blood test results (which I did on my first hour of waiting) are not there. I was so mad people at the waiting area were fuming as well waiting even more then I did some 9 hours. I don’t know where our taxes go,1
"I have been to easybook today right from the start it was fantastic service. First i was seen by a nurse called stacey??? She was brilliant came over very friendly credit to the hospital.then i seen nurse lynne she was fantastic. This nurse was wonderful she really
is hospital credit thank you both i felt really comfortable",5
"There are 2 sides to this hospital. The effective and polite front line staff, and the administrative shambles behind it.
The automated switchboard is an ill thought out mess. The options have no connection to the appointment invite. Most people are not familiar with NHS speak.
Most people rang and shunted appointments during COVID, with the consent, agreement and understanding of the staff. The system then closed the file after three shunted appointments. Despite a critical heart condition, I was blocked and had to start again through my GP wasting the consultants time, my GP's time and leaving me in a life trhreatening condition. All because nobody in systems bothered to adjust anything on account of COVID.
The NHS, their front line staff and the tax paying public are being let down by the indifferent attitude of the system administrators.",3
"Very poor service for a number of years was stuck in a&e for 24 hrs twice  then sent home in severe pain i'm a 70 yr old disabled amputee of the leg and have one kidney not functioning since a year ago
i have recently been to a crt scan and pre assessment appointment but cannot
obtain a procedure date 10 weeks later so i am putting a formal complaint in and seeking compensation for the suffering ive been through since 2017 there's no caring there for others",1
"My dad died in this hospital on 3/06/14. The nursing staff & doctors were wonderful. I wish the same could be said for the one receptionist. After checking him in I was told to sit & wait to be called. I sat there for 2 hours not knowing what was going on. I went to the reception desk where a new receptionist was on & she said ""You havent be called yet ?"" & told me to go to the nurses station where I saw my dad. The nurses thought he was on his own as the receptionist never bothered telling them that his daughter was there. My dad was on his own for 2 hours. Luckily I got to spend an hour with him before he died. Not happy",2
All treatment given by consultant very good place had no bad experience,5
91 year old mother went in for transfusion as anaemic been in over a month caught UTIs chest infections hospital acquired pneumonia sent home on oxygen paramedics had to take her back. Absolutely disgusting even paramedics said should not have been discharged,1
"I had a 10 o'clock  appointmenton February 19th 2020......for a gastroscopy.... Went in at 9.55, answered the nurses questions and then taken into room where it would be done, well! There was a team of four staff looking after me, and every one were amazing, caring and helpful, have full praise from start to finish......",5
"I went into the manor hospital for an inguinal hernia repair and not uncommonly was worried. I have to reassure anyone who reads this the whole proceed was handled extremely professional and please try not to worry as you will see it is no where near as bad as you may be thinking. It really is something you will handle better than you may at first think. I can't fault any one member of staff from the time I was diagnosed to the time I cam out after the operation. The actual surgical day was really one that was a lot less stressful than you would think and all the medical team where superb to me and everyone was so friendly. The surgeon Mr Rao was excellent and did a great job and all the tram including the anesthetist and the girls helping in the surgery were brilliant and kept me so calm and relaxed, they were so friendly. The recovery room staff were brilliant too so kind and considerate. I thin I was in ward 20 b over night from Wednesday dinner time to Thursday tea time. The staff in the ward and I mean everyone from the cleaners, the tea ladies and all of the wonderful nurses were just excellent and so professional and caring. I would like to thank each and everyone of them, you are all special to me and thank you Shirley, see I didn't forget lol.  The procedure to get out of hospital was a little slow but hey let's not mention that as all the staff were brilliant. I speak as I find and in so far as you have to go into hospital i just could not fairly give the whole experience and every single member of staff anything less than a 5 out of 5 for excellence. Thank you all so much. Just as a side note the guys in my ward were fantastic and we had some reall good laughs, I know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself in hospital but thats how ggod the experience was. So just a quick mention to the 20 b team of patients, that Mervyn , Edward, Strep(apologies if I have that slightly wrong), and Leslie. Yes with me just 5 in our ward and the ward was lovely.Terry Till",5
"Absolutely horrendous. My father in law has been going to this hospital for his treatment for cancer. All I can say is, if this is the level of service you get there is no point in putting money into the NHS. here are some of my experiences when i have been. Poor fellow in a bed next to my FIL needed help with going to the toilet, asked a nurse for help to which he was ignored and ended up doing the business in his bed because he couldnt hold it in. Another time I over heard a doctor say in A&E ""shes been waiting 7 hours for me, i'm going to make her wait at least another 3""!!!!! We wanted to know the diagnosis for my FIL for his inflamed Liver to be told by the doctor "" I'm off duty in 10 minutes i am not repeating myself, you FIL knows whats wrong with him ask him (bearing in mind my FIL was completely out of it due to the drugs)"" I nearly punched him and had to be restrained. The nurses (not all) are rude and not very helpful. one nurse was too busy playing on her phone and i stood there and counted to see how long it would take for her to notice. Had to clear my throat at the end to get her attention. I live in the North West and never have me or my family been treated like this in any hospital. Truly ridiculous.",1
"Very poor service in a&e, my Daughter was in severe pain and the staff seemed totally disinterested. They where on thier phones and planning the take away for the evening!! Lost count of the number of nursing staff who came over and she got asked the same question each time they came over. She has been on a multitude of pain killers and was left weeping with the pain for long periods of time. Avoid if you can!",1
For  god sake if you have to wait 8 hours in an hospital SO WHAT .... The NHS have been in the front line from day one . Like postmen . Bin men .. chemists...Pharmacy staff. Give them a break they as they could be saving your life next.  I take my hat off to everyone in the front line provide...... I can't thank Walsall Manor hospital enough ad they saved my life last year . .SO SHUT UP MOANING......AND JUST WAIT THEY ARE WORKING AND LOOKING AFTER EVERYONE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂,5
"i know the NHS is understaffed but never experienced anything like this place. My Mrs was referred by gp then had to sit in a&e for 2hrs to get seen. Finally got taken through to another department to find that the waiting area is full of people moaning about how long they've waited, some as long as five hours. So far sat here for 3 hrs (that's 5 hrs in total so far) and still not seen a doctor. I appreciate they're busy but this the worst place I've ever been",1
My dad was took in here early hours yesterday. He as been in many hospitals and said the staff and care he received here was second to none. He rates it the best hospital easily. Cleanliness and fantastic doctors and nurses. A shout out to the paramedics who took him there aswell brilliant.,5
"Yesterday i ended up having to call 111a few times because i have been quite unwell for over two months. The people who i spoke to were so kind and made me a doctors appointment at manor because they wanted me to get looked at as soon as possible and because new cross didn't have any appointment slots open so  my mom took me to the urgent care unit at one in the morning. The appointment was for 1:30. Didn't get seen until nearly three. When I did get seen the doctor did my temperature, bp, blood sugar. He just said to carry on with the tablets I have been taking for over a week. He said he doesnt think its anything serious. Said come back if the symptoms get worse. Bare in mind my local doctors said the same thing. They don't seem to understand that the only reason I was taken to the hospital was because it was serious. If it wasn't serious I would have been in my bed asleep. Don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon. Especially because of how messy the corridors and waiting rooms were. Rubbish all over the floor. Strains on the floor.",1
"I have been visiting this hospital for 35 years now and have always received excellent care within the old building and the new. My only niggle really is it would be so much better for patients and doctors if more than one procedure could all be done in one day, so do not have to keep  going back and fourth from one day to the next. It would also help with parking charges which can mount up over the days.. One more thing I personally would prefer to attend appointments in the daytime rather than the evening I don't think people really do like attending appointments at night.  Just my opinion. Other than that I do like this hospital.",5
Lovely staff ok took hrs to be sorted out but it was stitches in my hand through my own stupid fault. Very busy and I’m sure a lot more deserving people in front of me. Love you all at the NHS keep up the good work,4
My mum had a ct scan today she is 80 no heating on in any of the waiting areas or wards everyone was dithering with cold no one was really interested when patients complained terrible especially when patients have to remove there clothing,1
"Went to my appointment on time , all the NHS staff were friendly and professional.",5
"I have had to attend here many times over the past three yrs. My treatment has never been less than first rate. Always on time, courteous, & competent. Recommended.",5
"I am absolutely gutted with the service we got from Walsall Manor hospital.
We came at 1.20 and we got discharged at 6.30pm!!!!

We came with our 6 months old baby! He was really sick!
I am absolutely disgusted with the treatment and the service we got from this hospital. It seems like they do not care about anything or anybody. The doctors were just casually talking to staff leaving patients waiting anxiously. I have seen it with my own eyes.

About 4 or 5 nurses seen the baby and kept asking the same questions! Felt really frustrated and angry as we kept repeating ourselves.  Finally the paediatric doctor came and seen him after 6 hours!

I have NEVER experienced anything like this before!
We came to visit family from London . I have to admit Royal London hospital is the best for babies. Within 30min of arrival they see you and a paediatric is already waiting for you.
I guess this hospital is really backwards and need to update their service! Some seemed even racist. I came back from moving my car from the car park as my time limit was up, I came to A&E reception asking to go back... they looked at me as if I was a liar and a criminal. They said my son has been discharged,  when I challenged them with ward proof, they then made a weird face and toldme to go to another building....

The nurse seem to have a go at us for bringing the baby to hospital. I felt really uncomfortable. She said that the baby is smiling so no need to come. Omg! What kind of statement is that? So unprofessional and immature! My baby smiles at people anyway...its his natural habit. At least my baby smiles... some staff didn't even bother. Seems like they need to learn from babies!

I will never recommend anybody to come to this hospital.
I am really really disappointed!
They didn't even give us any medication for our baby.
I am lost for words!",1
Not enough deaf awareness and most doctors and nurses fully brainwashed make waste time for nothing.,1
"Beware of parking charges i was charged £6.50 for 45 minutes  which is for 2-3 hours, theres no one around to diapute it either
Rip off",1
Having been under the care of dermatology and haematology for a few months now i would like to praise Dr Wernham and his team and Dr Vega and her team and the nurses i have come into contact with having blood tests and scans.  I could not have had better care or kinder attention. I have a diagnosis and feel so confident that i could not be in better hands. Thank you all so much. You are all a true testament to the best of our NHS.,5
"Absolutely disgusted with Walsall Manor. Was told by 3 different doctors I will not be needing surgery and I believed of course as they are doctors. I've had my appointment transferred over to Blackpool Victoria Hopsital. I was in Walsall Manor for 5 days and I have heard more from Blackpool Vic in a day than I had heard at Walsall Manor and I was in 5 days, I then was told by Blackpool Vic that I had a life changing injury and will be needing surgery but with metalwork, plates, screws ect. If I wouldn't of transferred my appointments over and went home I would of ended up with the broken bones (in which the majority of my foot is smashed to pieces!) Not healing right and would've had to have surgery to break my foot again and to risk potentially more damage! Absolutely disgusted with what I thought was a great Hopsital. Wouldn't want to come back even if I were comatosed!",1
"Called main reception to speak to A&E, it took  reception 4 mins to answer then when I  got through to A&E  the  phone was  answered then went dead. So let's start again this time it took 4.38 mins for phone to be answered then A&E answered the phone and asked me to hold for a minute....11 minutes later I hung up. And yes you guessed it we started all over again. I asked the receptionist if she thought this treatment was acceptable she said they were busy. So I got in the car and drove from Milton Keynes to ask if they could locate my 87 year old mum who had been bought in by ambulance .",1
"Had my son here on the 27th of Jan 2018 . What an experience, I stayed for 3 night in total . Every single member of staff who dealt with me had been nothing but fantastic, Caring , kind , thoughtful and great at what they did . A massive thank you and well done . The NHS is under so much pressure but the people who give there heart and soul prove every day how amazing they are . 10 out of 10 And thank you .",5
"Due to Covid-19 and no relatives, spouses being able to go into the hospital. The telephone service for each ward i have had to ring is appalling, how are you suppose to find out how your loved ones are. I understand they’re busy but this is a pretty disgusting service. Need to man the phones a bit better",2
"Spent 17hrs trying to find out where my 94yr old nan who has dementia .  taken in via ambulance, no proper update, finally located her at the AMU . I've never heard such a cant be arsed attitude.  All we wanted to know is was she ok and what was happening.  To be told I'm not looking after her , I'm not the nurse , I dont know anything of this lady ??Youll have call back later. Weve spent 17hrs tracking my nan already . Disgusted.... Would it hurt to ask !! Didnt want her there in the first place .. NEVER EVER AGAIN.",1
"My father in law passed away due to their lack of care. He went in by ambulance with low blood pressure, to be sent home with sh  stroke. He collapsed again at the car park, he was taken back in. My father in law passed away due to neglect that day, and all we've been told is staff with be trained so it doesn't happen again. How is that going to bring him back, he wasn't a test subject!!! He was a loved respected man",1
Recently had appendicitis so I went in and obviously had then removed the stay was comfortable but lack of response from nurses was having a anxiety attack before the operation as it was my very first op and was unable to breath for at least 20 minutes before the nurses could get me a doctor to do something to cool the anxiety as I could not relax. The nurses do a stunning job but are so over worked and do such long hours that it's hard to see if they are happy to be there or just aren't bothered and in some instances are so short staffed that I rarely saw a nurse walk into our ward bay other then to take out blood pressure and readings. Also when leaving the hospital and being recommend to relax and rest to 2 week within three hours of me returning home the ward I was on phoned me to say that the doctor had prescribed me more antibiotics and wanted me to collect them the day after and said they would be ready for 2 o'clock in the afternoon. My partner and my father went up to the hospital to go collect the newly prescribed antibiotics and within a couple of hours I had a bad reaction to the drug as it completely contradicted and rejected the other drugs I was taking and nearly made me end up back in hospital. I don't know what happened down at the pharmacy but I do think they need to pay more attention to what is inside the drugs before dishing out to paitents without knowledge of a doctorate and are dependent on the doctors to make the right call. Overall the nurses on the ward are overworked and some are studying and are left to deal with paitents on there own this may be due to under staffed. And the doctors really need to know what they are giving to the paitents.,2
I was admitted as an impatient for 6 days after visiting the critical care unit next to the A&E. I was suffering from severe kidney infection and De-Hydration. The service and staff was wonderful. Cannot praise them enough. Well done ward 17.,5
As hospitals go this is one of the best. Once you get used to the system how to find your way around it's easy to find where you are going. It's absolutely spotless inside and there are plenty of toilets. The staff are friendly and helpful and polite. There is a shop and cafeteria to have a drink and something to eat. The only problem that you have is having to pay for parking.,5
"Reception staff very helpful. Sat in grubby a&e for four hours to see a doctor. Doctor saw us for 90 seconds. Terrible place. Then I had to pay £4.80 to get off the car park. I was parked between 11:30pm and 3:30 am. Shame on the operators, disgusting charges.",1
Was assessed on triage unit and nurse asked me to use my torch on my phone to check my cervix. Terrible that they didn't have a torch. Smh they need to supply this hospital with proper equipment.,1
"Worst Hospital in the West Midlands, clearly understaffed, definitely do not care about the patient and no communication with patients. Expect you to sit around twiddling thumbs then when its finally your turn....just go home and have paracetamol.",1
Wow! The reception staff are the most rude people I have ever seen. No compassion for fellow humans. Behaviour of the reception staff made me think of prison waerdens from the movies. Simply horrible Behaviour,1
They call my wife for laproscopy at 7am and we wait here for 8 hour for actual appointment at 3pm.very very unprofessionalism,1
"Undergone massive redevelopment recently. This is my local hospital, I've been a number of times throughout my life and I've never had any problems.

Expect to wait, that's how it works. Staff are friendly.

However, there are legitimate care concerns in some areas apparently, Google 'care quality commission manor hospital' to read detail.",5
Would need pages to explain just how very scary the manor hospital is. Why oh why isn't their an investigation. Most of the staff are wonderfull unfortunately thay have to carry the bad.,1
"Staff here are exellent especially in A&E where nurses and doctors made me as comfortable as possible, were mega kind and treated me with upmost respect. The nurses and Jr. Doctors on ward were also very kind and caring and made every effort to help me in any way possible.

The only bad points I can say is that I had a long wait to see a doctor in A&E  but that is to be expected in most nhs hospitals. I did feel that the senior doctor was trying to turf me out of the bed without really caring if i was well enough to leave but I do understand how high the demand for beds is.

Overall a wonderful demonstration of our nhs at work!!",4
"I have recently had a Mastectomy. I cannot find the words to thank Mr Kasana and the breast care nurses . Special thanks to Helen and Trish.
You are all so kind and caring. THANK YOU ALL.",5
"My main complaint is about the lack of consideration given to patients during the night by staff . Having been admitted to ward 17 on 24th. May 2017 and being dismissed on 5th. June 2017, making 11 nights stay I was and still am amazed at the volume of speach and general noise made, I believe that in total I was able to get 2.30 hours continuous sleep in one go, the rest of the time I was ""cat napping"" 1 hour at a time. I have always thought that a good nights sleep was beneficial to recovery.
Staff were calling to each other,  talking loudly to patients and leaving lights and machinery running unnecessarily.
I have always thought that come night time that wards would be kept as quite as possible with a nurse being there to maintain things.
Things such as blood pressure tests and sugar test surely aren't necessary throughout the night.",1
"Telephone booking for visitors is a shambles,  takes nearly an hour to get through.  Online booking doesn't exist despite website link that doesn't function,  what a joke I've spent over 2 hours  trying to get information on my dad in this hospital",1
"Possibly one of the worst days for my wife  to have a fall and break an arm with industrial action ongoing. However from the moment that I rang 999 to us getting back home early this afternoon we had the best care and service in the world. Special mentions and thanks to the ambulance crew who were gentle, caring and very thorough. A big thank you to all of the Walsall Manor Team working with Dan O'Carroll in A & E who were without exception caring, respectful and thorough at a very difficult time.",5
I had to have a csection but not happy with there service as i got infected straight away. They was more worryed about a virus you cant catch than looking after me properly. I would never recommend noone to go to this hospital. Its a really bad hospital it was in the paper too.,1
"Absolutely ridiculous, staff at maternity are really rude and too busy talking about Thier own family problems and nights out ......if you raise your complain you will be kicked out by the security staff !!!!  TRY to Avoid if you got a choice , otherwise you will be their next victim with your innocent newly born baby and helpless mother who's stomach wide open with councless stitches..... I felt so helpless and all the memorable , Nobel moments were destroyed because of the rude ,careless and selfish staff .",1
I had my tongue tie fixed here 2 weeks ago and it has completely healed now. I want to thank the 3 staff members who worked on a Saturday to get that done for me in the maxillofacial unit. They were all really nice and friendly and informative.,5
5 hours on the phone and unable to check what is happening to 93years old mother taken by ambulance. A&E do not answer the phone no-one else can help. Appalling. Perhaps Trust CEO can make it work!,1
"Yet again - Fantastic care, arrived at A+E 22 Dec by ambulance, booked in and seen by first nurse within 15 MINS. Overall including all tests i.e. ECG, urine. chest X ray and antibiotics been given to my husband by the Dr (without us having to wait at dispenerery).
Stop knocking this hospital, get behind them and we will be all the better for it.",5
"Inadequate planning, operation cancelled 5 times then to rub salt in cancelled one minute before the operation. My missus has all the drawings on her ready for surgery.

This is disgusting and they need to book their ideas up.",1
"been suffering with ongoing reflux all night and being sick for a long time! was finally told i could have a breath test as i didnt think an endoscopy was necessary for something that could be found using a easier way. waited months to be told my papers had been lost and i should of been seen sooner and had a brief apology, lost lots of weight gone down to practically nothing and still struggling to put the weight on as well as this im unwell with severe anxiety so this made me worse. finally got a breath procedure and was told I have Hyplori! took the antibiotics but was still suffering after treatment for months and went back and forth to different gps and had countless blood tests to be told the manor likely doesn't do the funding for the test anymore  yet i could have a more invasive endosocopy to show if i still have hyplori when a breath exam would show it anyway? Looks like I may be being transfered to another hospital soon.  Hoping to get this problem sorted once and for all!",2
"Went for planned c-section hospital didn't put security tags on my newborn baby (security ankle tag)

Discharge me the day after surgery and 1 night stay. I was asked to leave the ward at 4pm and wait to be picked up from the waiting room. With my 1 day old baby, there was 1 plastic chair to sit in that was painful to get in and out of and no facilities for my baby. No drinks facilities or adequate heating (it was December) the staff knew  I couldn't get a lift till 6:30 yet they still made me leave the ward",1
"Appalling hospital. Sent home in the same pain.
X-ray and MRI of totally the wrong area of body.
Type 1 diabetic,  no food provided for over 24 hours.

"After so many months of going in(from January/Feb 2018) and out with my daughter who they said had constipation most of the time or just a cold, it was later discovered she had cancer early April 2018. It took too long for them to notice. She died in October 2018, only 6 months after diagnosis aged 3 years old. Every day is painful and again like some comments I have seen here they said they will review so that it dont happen again. Sadly shes gone and this is not gonna bring her back.",1
"Hand sanitiser and face masks at every entrance point, hats off to all the staff that are working under these tough times",5
My doughtar has been sick 5 time within 2 hours I rang hospital they gave the appointment when I came on the given time in the urgent care unite they told me to wait and they said it's gonna take 1 and half hours more so what's the point of giving appointment???? People come to hospital when they ain't well not for picnic or sommt . What should a patent do if he ain't feeling well middle of the night come to hospital and couldn't see the doctor for hours and hours it's always being same it happens all the time whenever we come here. And it happens with everyone,1
"Very clean ,friendly staff doctors allways happy to help when asked kept well informed",4
"Went for my 1st COVID Vaccine. It was all incredibly well organised and thought out. You enter through the caravel door - hand sanitising stations by the door then you are instructed to follow the orange arrows. You check in at reception and they direct you to a Marshall. The marshall cleans a pen and clipboard and gives it to you. You sit on a socially distanced chair to fill your form in and a Marshall collects it once you're done. You are then taken into the vaccination room, where screens are up between patients. The nurse comes and does the vaccine for you and you proceed to a waiting area, where you sit for 15 mins. Whilst you wait, the marshall gives you an appointment to come back for the second jab. There is even a bay set up with life saving equipment in the waiting room incase of any adverse reaction. Then when you are done, you continue following the 1 way system out the building. Superb organisation.",4
"Treatment on suspected prostrate Cancer so far has been mixed, even though I see a different Urology consultant every visit. The hospital Administration though is a total joke. Promised appointments rarely arrive, files get lost and new empty ones appear. The latest catastrophe was being invited in to discuss the results of a biopsy but the results couldn't be found!!! Not pleasant when cancer is suspected. Was later told via letter Cancer was not found and a follow up appointment will be arranged and nearly 5 1/2 months later still nothing!",1
"Extremely disappointed to discover that after 4 months of waiting, I'm still on a waiting list for rhumetology with no time frame as to when I can be seen. It must be normal to be in pain and wear back, wrist and knee supports at 23 just to try and do normal jobs. Extremely saddened to see that this is the reality for ""routine"" appointments.",1
"Absolutely rubbish, when a patient is admitted you would think that they would at least have the common courtesy to let the family know but you get nothing here, eventually when you phone up they say the same thing which is the ward is extremely busy and they give you a extension number that just rings, however they are trained to say the same thing regardless of what ward you are given the extension number to and when you go to the hospital they say you're not allowed to visit due to covid..... And these people want a pay rise! Too busy on facebook and twitter or instagram",1
"Gynecology is a complete disaster. Waited 6 months for an appointment there, only to be yelled at by a super snappy doctor who didn´t help me at all. If you can, go elsewhere.",1
"Cant complain about the checks theyre performing on me or the one nurse who has been brilliant to me, but the fact that im just waiting to be told results and theres most of the staff sat talking about when theyre going out to get pissed is beyond a joke. Asked ages ago how long its going to be and was told that the report just needs reading through, that was an hour ago and i keep seeing the same couple of staff doing stuff the rest are chilling gossiping....",3
"I recently took my wife to A&E and I was amazed by the excellent and timely service delivered by the staff in A&E. All staff were professional, Courteous and passionate to deliver the care based on 6'C Model. All staff in A&E were superb but y CSW Sofia Mumtaz, Ssr Leslie Smith, Ssr Tracy and Dr. Alam were outstanding and went extra mile to put at ease.
As my wife was later admitted to AMU, we were greeted by another professional and superb team. I would like to praise Ssr Kirstie Adli for her help and support and excellent communication and her commitment and dedication toward her patients and all the team. The nurses in the bay and Ambulatory area were equally kind and courteous and provided the excellent. The doctors were caring and very supportive and the communication was delivered at a very high standard.

I can't thank enough to these 2 excellent teams of A&E and AMU for getting it right the first time. These 2 teams are an asset to this aspiring trust.

Thanks once again and your help and support is much appreciated.

"I've been to the Manor Hospitsl many times, and have always been impressed by the friendly and professional attidues of its staff. The new building is great: light and airy, and without any of the old fashioned claustorphia and chloroform smell that I used to associate with hospitals. It's 'only' the local hospital (so no kidney transplants here...), but it seems to be working hard to provide a good service to the people of Walsall, and so be a place where it's safe to entrust one's care.

Keep up the good work guys....",5
"Shocking Hospital, 84 year old parent left in A+E on a trolley for 16 hours. If I can get anyone to answer a phone they are rude. Unable to get any sort of diagnosis on her condition, just left in the dark. Appalling.",1
From seeing my GP having an urgent ambulance and being admitted to MAU my overall care has been incredible all the nurses Drs Consultants have given me exceptional care beautiful food a smile kindness care absolutely 5 star I can not Thankyou all enough just brilliant,5
"I would like to thank Dr Cheti and the nursing staff for the care of my father in 2014 on the Oncology Ward. They were caring, informative and never stopped trying to help my father with his illness. As a patient's relative, I think they do wonderful work under very difficult circumstances.",5
"Breast Cancer Nightmare - Manor Hospital is the worst hospital ever. I have basically had 2 botched operations by Manor. Because my breast cancer was so small the hospital put a metal clip next to it so that they would be able to find it easily, after my 1st operation no clip & no cancer were found I asked for an MRI scan etc but was told no I needed a 2nd op to remove a larger section, after the 2nd op still no clip or camncer were found.  Then they wanted to do an MRI scan but they booked the wrong scan, I eventually received the correct scan which showed no clip but the cancer was still there. Basically we established that the clip was removed during the 1st op but the pathologist dropped it on the floor BUT it was put in the wrong place to start off with !!! Unbelievable !! So then they want to send me for a mastectomy -  perhaps their policy is 2 attempts then remove or amputate ??? On the day of 1st op I am left with a scar from an injection where the nurse slipped and left a hole, the nurses were then trying to place the wrong booby on machine to insert wire,the ward said they were expecting me but had no idea what I was in for and they couldnt find my notes ??There is far more to this story - I would recomend that anyone with breast cancer stay away from this hospital for your own health & sanity !!!!",1
"They look after my Nan very well
Thank you",5
"Go somewhere else if you value your health atall. This hospital only care about keeping beds free and less about your health. Stayed here on multiple occasions due to ill health and have been treated like rubbish on multiple occasions, referred to the wrong specialist, verbal abuse by staff. Complete waste of time and money. Bound to make you feel worse.
A and E is the worst.",1

Money making scheme @ Urgent treatment centre parking! Why is there more disabled parking bays than normal bays? So you can fine drivers for parking in a disabled bay. People go there in emergencies and you guys are taking the piss!!!,1
used to have to go here for my DIABETIC specialist appointments always on time probably the cleanest hospital ive been in I been in a lot.

"My mum was in AMU on Easter sunday and unfortunately passed away after 8 hours. I would like to thank all on AMU for the dedication showed to her and the family. Neil her primary nurse was amazing to us, how he dealt with us at a difficult time was second to none. The respect, dedication and professionalism, was a credit to his profession and to the hospital...Walsall residents are lucky to have such a dedicated nurse. A big thank you from Hilary,Diane and families for the care of Iris Walker.",5
"The worst hospital I have seen by far. I asked the nurse for baby milk for my new born. The nurse told my wife to get up and get it herself after a c section. Rude and ignorant staff, very dirty facilities. Don't be fooled by what the hospital looks like on the outside as it is dirty and staff are rude. AVOID AVOID!!!",1
From diagnosis of kidney cancer (Mid January) to my subsequent surgery by Mr Koneru's team and excellent nursing in ITU everything was handled professionally and courteously.Everyone made me feel that I was a special patient and this made me feel confident in a successful outcome.

"I've come away from this hospital today feeling stressed and depressed, the way you are spoken to by staff doctors , nurses etc in this hospital is disgusting they treat you like you are doing them a favour or something, trust me I don't want to be in a hospital like manor hospital, its dirty, no one knows what there doing no one speaks to you properly, look if you are not happy with your job let someone else do it it's really made me upset  remember people come to you because they have too not want to",1
"Walsall Manor Hospital- Where the hospital bed is more important than the person in it. Uncaring, under qualified staff- too quick to write-off their 'patients'.
Where gorvenment paperwork completion is top prioriry and not the welfare of the patient or their families. No glimmer of dedication or devotion in sight. Care isn't their name and most certainly isn't their game.... Zero rating.",1
"Omg really,  o though I was in a third world country,  the please is a tip.  I went in with pains in my chest and arm.  And after a couple of questions got told to sit and wait,  after about 1 hour I got to see someone and had an ecg etc,  I'm still here after 2 hours waiting to see a doctor,  rough does not come close to describing this place,  I thought good hope was bad.   It's like a place compared to this.",1
"Absolute awful place to work at! Too many self centred egotistical people! Would recommend staying well clear of this place if you require people that are rational thinking, polite or even have an ounce of humanity within them when it comes to employment and dealing with staff! There are some absolute gems that work here that are being used and abused! HR needs to take note and take on these complaints.",1

The website desperately needs updating as non of the ward extension numbers are correct and unfortunately when I go through the switchboard there is a long wait and if you are lucky to be transferred the ward there is another long wait or the phone goes dead after a certain time.,2
So far very good experience with this hospital at antenatal clinic much better than city hospital very good staff and doctors,5
"Took my 13 year old son to A&E, arrived about 11am saw a nurse who spoke to him like he was 3yrs then transferred to the urgent assessment unit route 238.  Walked out at 2.33pm without seeing a doctor and adults going in infront  of us.  Total waste of space, thought Stafford was bad!",1

I went to manor hospital as I caught a bug since having the bug I stopped eating for 3 weeks and when I got there all they gave me was tablets antibiotics how the hell  am I suppose to take tablets on a empty stomach?  To be honest Walsall manor hospital ain't all that doctors don't listen to you so 1 star I wouldn't recommend going there again...if I could I wouldn't give no stars to this hospital....also all they do is chat,1
"Needed to update surgery Pre Assesment information, spoke to the receptionist at Easy Book - she was not interested one bit, worse than useless, Easy Book? not with a very unhelpful receptionist in the way!!!",1

Booking an appointment does not guarantee being seen on time. Be prepared to wait at least an hour after the appointed time. Not ideal at all especially as you can't take anyone with you.,1
Every time we go there is always a drama. We always have to push for treatment and some of the doctors are shocking. 3 pokes with a finger does not indicate that my son has a virus!,1
This hospital recieves money from the ccg to provide care for my daughter's diabetes treatment. Yet part of that care and funding should include psychology. They provide no psychology care and yet still recieve the money. The money isn't put back into the diabetes team it is spent elsewhere or collecting dust.....hoe can you recieve money for something and not provide that service. Therefore this is fraud....its no surprise you didn't meet the standard of care when the CGC inspected last year.,1
Useless hospital waited 5 hours and just left after severe pain. Wouldn't even call this a hospital its a disgrace any other hospital is better.,1
"Nurses and doctors helpful if any questions always getting answer and help. Wait is long but that’s understandable, thank you everyone for your hard work!",5
I'd just like to say I've been there today in accident and emergency and the staff were excellent had ecg but still went up to anbicly care were I had full body scans bloods ect sandwiches and water and the staff there was so friendly I'd just like to say thankyou,5
I have never seen such neglect from hospital staff it's like half the nurses and doctors enjoy leaving the patients to suffer and do the laziest half-arsed job possible.,1
"it was my first time in a NHS hospital - and I was pleasantly surprised: all staff, doctors, nurses, janitors etc were lovely, professional, kind and patient",5
I had a great birth experience thanks to my midwife-Scarlett Nicholls. She was absolutely brilliant and supportive.,5
"If you have an appointment your fine, the doctors are good the waiting times are around 30 minutes  or less and the after care is good,
A & E is a different story, a nurse ordered a ambulance for my mom with suspected sepsis and she was left for 6 hours and then rushed to intensive care with kidney failure she nearly died, we have had other experience""s with A&E and the longest wait was 11 hours before being admitted somthing REALLY has to be done to improve this department",4
"Arrived for appointment 10 minutes early booking in was a farce,was told that there was a 40-50 minute wait because doctor was late , hospital generaly had not got a clue very disappointed",1
Children's unit in accident and emergency - staff were fantastic. Hardly any waiting time for my 2 year old - 10 mins at most. Thankyou so much.,5
Would be lovely if you could get information recarding your health im awaiting letter about results to be told I have to wait for as secretary is of sick till after 16Nov so I'm going to have another set of blood tests that I probably don't need and they wonder why NHS  has no money prime example,2
"Management of this organisation endorses rampant bullying by their inactions. I am personally aware of bullying complaints that have made their way to the CEO but no action has been taken. ""Stand up to Bullying"" is nothing but a hollow chant from the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust.

Respect, Teamwork, Compassion, Professionalism are values set by the staff, promoted by the organisation but not adopted by Executive Management. Please take time out to read staff surveys which clearly highlight a rise in bullying culture in the organisation and clear support from the Executive and Non-Executive Management by their inactions.",1
Extremely poor out patient service compare to city hospital. Keep cancelling my appointment. Had enough with this hospital ask my GP to change it  to city . Total waste of time went through pain for approx 5 months. Very poor service .,1
"Absolute joke.
Being send from one place to another, having the same test done twice, and when you tell them I've already had this done, they'll give you the most ridiculous answer you could hear from a doctor or a nurse, well I don't have the results WHAT ???
Waiting hours are ridiculous and the place is storming with doctors and nurses just walking around looking for their heads
You never know what they are doing with you",1

This hospital really needs improving,1
Car parking is atrocious riding around for ten minutes to find a space in the finish had to park on the foot path at by Moat Road being a blue badge holder this is totally unacceptable and being charged extortionate parking fee's for the privalige.,1
My partner was to have her baby when time after time we was moved in and out of the delivery department. The reason was not enough staff to deliver our baby. Leaving my partner in really bad pain for over 24 hours. STILL WAITING!!!,1
Hit and miss with service from doctors and nurses. AMU is very good but ward 7 not so much. Have to push for things to be done. Willing to leave u most of day without checking u ok. Public areas clean and shops/restaurant ok but restaurant bit pricey,3

"Most A&E staff were friendly and genuinely caring.
Other wards, not so much. I wouldn’t ever chose to go to this hospital again.",2
Be warned this hospital plays god with people's lives they decide if you live or die I can't go into go much detail because we.are planning on taking legal action but question everything if your love one goes in and don't come.back out epesialy the pack of lies you will get from them never mind protect the NHS it should be protect us from the NHS.,1
"Lack of respect. Had a distorsion on my ankle they didnt even help me to reach the room where i needed to go. Lack of respect.would never go there again..also takes bare time to check someone, u need to wait for 2-3 hours+. Absolutely dissapointed.",1
From start to finish the level of care was faultless. These people are totally dedicated in providing 1st class expert care. Well done. Thank you,5
Staff were attentive. My Son has a bad tooth and fractured arm In an accident . Staff very helpful made sure he felt at ease.,4

"All I can say is how disappointed I was to discover thast it doesn't matter how ill you are or how urgent the operation you need is (despite the doctor writing URGENT on the paperwork), as soon as the paperwork reaches EASYBOOK you are placed on a pile of papers and left there till somweone eventually gets down the pile to where you are. At this rate I will be paralised from the waist down before they reach the request for my spine operaton form",2
First class in every way all the staff Nurses and Doctors where very caring and left no stone unturned very grateful  to a,5
"Staff are rude and pretty obnoxious, didnt like being asked for basic information, was there for 8 hours for partner who had keyhole surgery, partner had bruises on her and scratches and a fat lip, dont know how keyhole surgery can cause this, staff walking round eating and drinkng, no excuses for the staff to be so un professional really, parking prices a joke, looks like millions were spent on a face lift to the front building but forgot to improve the wards, very poor.",1

No good  urgent care  centre  5 hours wait and  I had miscarriage. Still staff  laughing and talk,1
Waited 6 hours seen by one nurse and one doctor after 3 hours and once the doctor came he said to wait for another 10 minutes yet Iv waited for another hour and a half worst waiting time,1

Some people may have good experiences but many haven't. Like going in with stroke symptoms being sent home then next day having a massive brain stem stroke....,1
The queue to pay for the car park is terrible. There are now about 20 people waiting. By time you get to pay they have added another hour. And it's not cheap,2
Nice big open plan shoping and food area clean condtion. Friendly staff can get very busy at visiting times car parking area is mostly full and costs signs are marked clearly for where to go for appointments,4
"Got to agree with Asha D
I went to A&E after I fell onto my side at home, damaged my ribs and was struggling to breathe
After getting through triage Dr sees me and tells me I have muscle bruising to my side
I asked if they are going to xray my side to be sure and he said they would IF I WANTED TO
Xray done and was returned to A&E, was told xray was okay and I was given liquid morphine ( not told what it was prior to taking) and then sent home
Wife contacted my GP to get prescription for painkillers and my GP confirmed fracture of the 9th rib
I will be attending Lichfield hospital in future
Walsall manor is woeful",1

"My husband was brought into the stroke unit.
Lovely clean hospital but we struggled so much understanding the nurses as many have very broad accents.
Amanda the student nurse on ward 41went above and beyond. Excellent patient care. Warm and friendly.
The hospital is let down by a lack of functioning equipment and the lifts haven't been serviced or repaired for months.
Sign of the times I guess 😞",3
Spent 7 hours 51 Minutes 31. Dr decided that need to be admitted. In very considerable pain and asked for Ibuprofen and Paracetamol which are taken every night. She said need to ask Dr to prescribe. The she went off for about half and half. No pain-killers and no nurse. left sitting on chair to be admitted to ward. Nurse walking about as if on holiday park. I just left. came home and took painkiller. A waste of 8 hours and 4 minutes in total.,1
"On this visit we really cannot fault the service given to our elderly mum. Speedy scan on arrival to check for stroke in an A/E resembling a war zone. The staff all deserve pay rises for putting up with everything going on in there whilst still giving great care. Apart waiting 13 hours for an assessment bed the treatment and care given was excellent, safe, and very well led. The bed management is amazing and the fact that there are no agency staff makes a noticeable difference in the morale and continuity of care. I am sure staff are working under pressure but I was reassured that my mum was in safe hands at all times. The car park is quite expensive but that aside this is how all hospitals should be. I can't thank everyone enough.",5
"They are short of staff in A&E.
Last night 43 person in queue waiting time to see doctor 12 hours.
Be prepared every hour to you or sblomebody fall on the floor.
So after you survived 12 hours on uncomfortable wooden chair 🪵  , you expect to see doctor?
But not in this hospital, you see student or junior practice for 3 minutes chat.

NHS used to be one of the best in the world, but now with not well educated and short staff become one of the ........",1
"Absolutely horrible, the hospital management is awful. Here are a few of my experiences. I went to A&E SAU recently and first of all, the nurse didn't take my blood properly and I have a bad bruise now and it has been painful for days. Initially I saw it was very crowded and so I asked for the average waiting time and they told me they didn't know. After around 6 hours I asked again they said the waiting time is 8 hours. In the end I ended up in the hospital for over 10 hours just for a ct scan. I got to the hospital at 5pm and left at 3am. At around 2:30am I went up to reception to ask why my result has taken longer than 2 hours, then the nurse looked and said nobody wrote my name on the list, it was only then they wrote my name which was absolutely appaling. Worst experience, I would rather endure any kind of pain than go back there ever again.",1
"Can I start by saying the understaffed nurses are doing an amazing job.

The management needs to support the staff better.

I am in with my daughter and the parking cost is obscene, I could park in London for less.

Second, the hygiene is almost non-existent.
I can see why people are getting an infection.
Just been to the toilet, the floor is still dirty,  clearly the cleans never look up of the floor or behind doors, as the back of the doors are dirty, the floor behind the doors has months of dirty and blood up the wall..

Walking down the corridors, it's the same. Stair well, I have seen cleaner ones in the back-end high-rise flats in London.

Also, I saw a number of people in the last 24 hours who have been to Warwick, Nuneaton, and  ended up here as the wait was over 6 hours or they could not be seen. So please explain why every time the residents from Rugby ask for their A&E back, we are told you are coping, 6 to 15 hours, and dirty hospital is not coping by any standard.",2
Waited an hour for a booked fasting blood test when I haven't eaten since yesterday! It was bad enough not being able to get an early morning appointment and 12.50pm was the earliest time. It will now be 14 hours since I've eaten or drunk anything other than water! The reason .......    they are short staffed! I'm pretty sure they won't pay the extortionate parking fee for the long wait!,1
"My recent visit to the Endoscopy unit was quite beyond my expectations.  I felt cared for, supported by a team that were extremely efficient ,  attentive and very professional.  My fears about the procedure were completely disipated and everything was done perfectly on time. Brilliant team of doctors and nurses.  I cannot praise the NHS enough.  Thank you so much",5
Terrible a and e experience after being sent there by my gp . Staff kept trying to move my wheelchair to the middle of a v busy waiting room despite knowing a have a neurological disorder. In triage I was given morphine to help with my pain then told I would need to wait for 10 hours in the car park as they were so busy. Never in my life have I experienced such lack of care i just cried. The waiting room had a pile of used gowns on the floor. I saw a wheel chair taken off an elderly man who was then sat in achair with an oxygen mask plonked on his lap. It was so loud my ear plugs proved hopeless. A lady spoke to my mum  she had been bought in by ambulance and had been there 11 hours and still waiting . Blood pressures were being taken in the waiting room. I physically could not wait due to my disability. Sitting in a wheel chair for what was now a 12hour wait was impossible. I am still on a lot of meds to manage my pain and no answers. I still cannot take the images of the dirty room and the elderly patients sat in there out of my head. .,1
"After a 7 hour wait for an ambulance my mum way taken gear after a fall. In A and E nobody seemed to know what they were doing I kept explaining my mum has dementia and what’s she’s like yet I still get asked if it’s ok to check her to see if she has dementia yet she’s had it for 5 years. They moved her twice in an and e, then up to medical unit where her medication she has at home was not prescribed for her, so I had to take it over to be told by a nurse we can not gov it her but you can, then you have to leave as visiting is finished.but before you go can you help lift you mum and help me change her pad. Was not told when they moved her again. Finally found her to be told she’s being transferred to st cross. In the end they were not doing anything for her, she had no pillows for 3 days, and left in bed , not even taken to the loo and when messed her self took a couple of hours after asking for help so many Times. In the end I signed her out she has better care at home. Hospital is a joke",1
"My advice is If you don't need to go don't!! (GO TO YOUR GP MAKE THEM EARN THEIR MONEY FOR A CHANGE) I was in  need of help due to my asthma and chest infection. It took 40+ hours to get a bed (Which is disgusting managment need to pull their fingers out and organise things better) as they admitted me straight away. The nurses are just amazing they are so under staffed and under mense pressure. Every medical professional I came across went above and beyond. Empathy , Compassion shown all the way. I was on the MAU ward and was sat in assessment room as there where no beds.The lead nurse organised the ward and got me a bed and another lady with in an hour. (Much needed by this point)
Don't have a go at the nurses they are all trying their best. Thank you all
In A&E , Majors ,MAU, Wards 31 and 33 for my care. Hopefully I don't need another visit anytime soon I have a fear of A&E.",2
"I honestly can not praise the incredible doctors and nurses at this hospital enough.
I’ve had multiple appointments and procedure's leading up to some major stomach surgery and everything went smoothly, I was shown a caring professional nature from start to finish.
Today I left the hospital after my surgery on ward 10 and I want to thank each and every member of staff on that ward hands down for the incredible, difficult and stressful work they carry out.
I really can’t understand the negative comments from some.
obviously all experiences are different however I’ve had multiple days and appointments at this hospital equating to hours and hours of service that’s been hands down amazing. I genuinely believe too many people feel they are overly entitled and quite often don’t need to be there for a cough or sprained ankle or a screaming child that stops a few hours later after calpol.

Once again thank you so much NHS and Coventry hospital for all your hard work.

Thank you, thank you

Alex",5
"I arrived at this hospital at 4am with an extreme fever (almost 40 degrees Celsius) and neck pain. The first doctor wasn’t even able to turn on the machine to observe my neck with the camera without my help or other staff members. He didn’t find anything and left everything for the morning shift. I was left for a few hours on the chair till the other doctors arrived. After their observation, I was diagnosed with Pharyngitis and Fungus infection + scared me that I might have HIV. I was left on the chair for 6 hours rethinking my life. All of them were completely wrong. After spending more than 14 hours there, I was sent home with antifungus medication. Thank god I went to the GP the next day and he understood that I had thyroid inflammation. 3 doctors in this hospital didn’t even consider that, and didn’t add it to the blood test to check my thyroid hormones. Terrible experience",1
"Fantastic, I was scared going in but I was given care at every step of the process. Yes the car park is a bit expensive and yes I needed to wait at times but every person I spoke to was nice and cared about my well being. Do please remember every person working here is a human being and doing their best. The consultant, the radiograph lady, the nurses and the lady who told me how to get to where I needed to I thank you. I will not be scared to ask for help next time.",5
"Daughter was taken in as emergency, Sunday PM. Severe allergic reaction. Amazing care. Prescribed and out within 1 hour. Was a massive relief to us. Shame that the government can't fund free car parking. God bless the NHS",5
My husband was sent from his go to uch for an urgent chest expat? Sent to mau who sent him to minor injuries who sent him to a&e. Arrived at 12.30 pm had a 4 hour wait for triage told to go back to waiting room and someone will call you for a chest xray which went for 2 hours later then had to wait again for 3 hours to go to ct now time 9.15 pm people coming were being told waiting time 14 hours at 2 am was told maybe have to stay in as had partial collapse lung and lung infraction 5 am given antibiotics sent back to a freezing cold waiting room and told to wait. I popped home to get pjs and made him a drink and sandwich when I got back a&e was rammed couldn’t move people complaining about wait my husband (74) was huddled in a corner trying to keep warm he was so cold he was shaking I went to the desk to try and find out what was happening to be told yes we know he’s waiting and has been here 25 hours we are waiting for a bed on respiratory. 3.30pm was collected and taken to mau put in a room because of infection for him settled and he fell asleep 5pm asked what he wanted for tea ??. All of a sudden nurse comes in we have to move you when asked why ? Told he had been out in the wrong place ok collected his things and moved to corridor then put into a 8 bedder bay 4 mau had his tea no drink had to go to the shop to get a drunk for him doctor arrived 6.30 pm and talked to his second listened to his chest then said we will give you some antibiotics for 7 days have another cray in 2 weeks if the fluid hasn’t gone we will drain go home this is some thing that could have been given at the a&e consultation and saved us many freezing hour in an emergency waiting room that was like watching a headless chicken running round in circles. The poor nursing staff were so over run I’m surprised nobody died . To a&e cov is no place to be sadly,2
"The worst experience ever. I have been today there,cause my daughter 18months,ia suffering with a high fevers without any other symptoms. The GP doctor advised for a blood test. The A&E advised no blood test needed. I m trying 3 days to find out what is going on with my child as is not well the last month and everyone knows only how to send me back home with viruses diagnosis. Of course I will contact a solicitor as they dont give attention to my concern which is start to be very serious. Last time , GP advised that my Daughter has ear infection and A:E advised chest infection.
STOP PLAYING WITH LIFE'S!!!!!!",1
"Last week I had an appointment here for an X-Ray and it was my first time at this hospital. I must say that I didn’t have to ask anyone where to go because the indications were quite clear and I was able to find the right room only by following the signs, which was a good thing for me. Otherwise I would have felt very overwhelmed by the size of it. The personnel were polite and fast in doing their work, but not very attentive. Lastly but not least, I was surprised to see that the parking was quite far away from the building. Overall, my experience was ok.",3
"Well after last night's experience I hope I do not need A&E anytime soon!!!! The reception staff are so rude as I sat and could hear the way they speak to some people is just disgusting!!! I understand they have to deal with irate patients when they're being told 7 hours wait to see a Dr but from what I seen no one caused a scene over it. However, as a first point of contact they do not make you feel the most welcome. Hygiene?? What hygiene? I wish I'd have taken photos now. Bins overflowing with people having to put their rubbish on the floor next to the bins. The toilets Well I'd rather have held it in until I got home. Again bins overflowing and people having to put dirty nappi on top of the bin as nowhere else for it to go. Blood all over the floor toilet seat and just disgusting for a hospital. And this was reported on more than 2 occasions, yet in the 8 hours I was there nothing was done about it.",1
I was left 2 days without any sort of pain relief in crippling pain and yet I'm prescribed strong pain relief! When it was finally sorted I was given one days dose but the next day because I was unable to swallow tablets the nurse falsified her notes stating I'd been given it! Absolutely not the case so I'll be making a formal complaint and statement so she is unable to do such a dangerous and appalling thing again. because this is not the sort of nurse who should be in charge of patients I'll be contacting a solicitor to ensure I have the right experience to deal with this! This nurse is capable of killing a patient!,1
"Arrived at children a&e for my newborn daughter, couldn’t fault the staff in all departments who seen us from the nurses to doctors in a&e and especially in ward 15 who looked after us overnight. Would like to say how amazing they all was and very happy with all the checks they kept coming to do and checking on her all the time. Thankyou so much",5
"I need to make clear that I give 5 stars to every person that took care of me beyond WARD 35. Once off the ward for treatment, scans , consultants the care was second to none, as soon as I was taken back to ward 35 you were pretty much on your own, having to ask for the medication you’d been promised you would receive. I needed pain relief and was asking for it constantly and found myself pretty scared and alone . I asked for certain medication that I was supposed to be taking, took them 12 hours to finally give it. I was totally ignored by one member of staff when asking for pain relief. Staff members walking around saying I can’t be arsed today! People ringing their bells and staff just stood around talking about Christmas rotas. I’ve met a lot of amazing people while going through this cancer journey and they’ve made me feel very calm and cared for , but this which was my final treatment has made me scared to go into hospital again. I will say there was one lady on the ward that helped me, but the rest were not bothered 😢 it’s took me a while to write this because I’m not the type of person to moan , but I really don’t want this to happen to others 🤗",1
"The maternity department is highly disorganized...i was asked to come in for an induction of labour only to be told the labour ward needs to break my waters since it did not break naturally and because of gestational diabetes the baby needs to be out before 41 weeks...i have been waiting on the labour ward for more than 3 days now and just one more day to being 41 weeks but no one to break waters and no tangible response from the labour ward regarding the breaking of waters...only to be moved around between wards 24 and 25 because some other patients need the bed space.
It's  a very poor experience and would nor recommend to anyone, not even my enemy.",1
"If I could give 0 starts I would. The consideration of the patients well being is not a priority. I was scheduled for an appointment to check my mole for sign of skin cancer as I have in my family someone recently diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. Although there were no signs of concerns I’ve received a letter with the notes of the doctor mentioning that I was anxious and that’s why I wanted to check it out with the emphasis on the anxious on the letter. This made me upset as is unprofessional I have not came to your clinic for that reason, the doctor could have just talked about the actual reason I was there instead of diagnosing me with Anxiety. The matter should be taken seriously someone has been diagnosed with cancer in my family. When I’ve asked to do a routinal blood test the GP said that I’ve done one last year which made me almost laugh as if I am not allowed to do one again/ is too much work in one year a lot can change. The health should be a priority and is not especially in this hospital .",1
"Terrible rude underaualified staff. Having a 19 year old lie directly to our face about treatment, and then when we tried to report her it turned out she gave us a fake name so we couldn't. A&E staff were extremely rude and it took me having to demand my partner see someone and when they evenually caved and sent us to the eye clinic, where it turned out her eye was in such a bad way she lost sight in it for 4 months, with neuronal damage to it, but the A&E staff believed she should have gone home and got some rest, which could have resultee in her being permanently blinded.  Both myself and my partner have advanced degrees yet any time we go back for her long term illness we are treated like morons by someone who hasnt even passed an undergraduate degree. Almost everything we are told at this hospital we check with our gp and every time they tell us the hospital is wrong. we are just lucky our GP is so good that he sends complaints to the hospital monthly about their poor standards of care.",1
"No child under 2(or any) should wait for 6 hours to be seen by a doctor. Children's A&E at this hospital is a disgrace.....kids deserve better care.

NHS you've failed!!",1
6h waiting time to se a doctor is mental.  I wonder how incompetent is the hospital Manager to have Sach performance. I'm wandering if he's getting any bonus this year,1
"Absolutely shocking service and not fit for purpose. I rushed my 5 year old son to the children's A&E as he suddenly started screaming his lungs out and complaining of intense tummy pain whilst having dinner at around 8 pm.

Upon arrival, there were quite a few kids waiting to be looked at, including some minor injuries. In the 5 hours that we were at the hospital, my son was screaming at the top of his lungs for the first 2. There was not enough place to take a seat and I was stood there with a crying and wriggling 5 year old on my arms for the better part of an hour. In the hour I was standing, I couldn't see a single person going into the A&E from the waiting area.

It took 2 hours for my son to be triaged and for a nurse to see him and give a shot of paracetamol. Once the paracetamol took effect, his crying subsided a little bit.

Upon checking with the receptionist on when he would be able to see a doctor, the response was ""You have only been here for 3 hours, you need to wait for another 3 before a doctor can see you child.""

In the end, it was wee hours of the morning, my son fell asleep and then woke up and said his pain is better and asked whether we can go home, which we did in the end, without seeing a doctor.

I am a very practical/pragmatic person and I can understand that the NHS is understaffed. But, what I saw was not that, it was complete apathy and disregard. I am not saying that my son should have been prioritised before other kids. I believe every life is valuable. But what I would have expected is immediate triage on arrival and prioritised based on severity so that no one needs to suffer in silence, ""hoping"" that they would be taken care of by the NHS.

What if there was a kid who had been in an accident or had severe enough internal bleeding? Would they still have to wait for 2 hours to be triaged? Would they even be alive after the 2 hours?

6 hours of wait is not something to be proud of, in fact, it is a ridiculous target. The inefficiency of the system and the apathy of the people working in it is unbelievable.

I only wish there was an option to not pay for the NHS directly/indirectly via taxes or NI. I would rather put that money towards private medical care.",1
"Excellent nursing and patient care, specifically all the staff on ward 52. They are undermanned, but make the best of it. Despite a lot of silly dictats coming from 'above' they soldier on. In my opinion, ALL managers,of whatever rank should spend a month on the wards, then they would be less likely to put the cart before the horse!",4
"I want to talk about a problem I had with my recent visit. On 09 August, 2023, I had a visit to the Neurology Department at the University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire, because I was being checked for a condition called MSA-C. I have a long history of severe drops in my blood pressure, which led to cardiac arrest and brain damage.

About a month later, I got a report from the neurologist, but it was full of discrepancies. The report said things I never stated, and there was no plan for a follow-up visit or any tests to look into my condition.

I've already made a complaint, and they've acknowledged it. I'm curious to see how the hospital will handle this situation likely awkwardly attempting to cover the misconducts with their doctors. However, I'm also planning to share my story on a website because it's time to let people know about the very bad service patients are constantly and repeatedly receiving from the NHS.",1
"A 22 hour wait in A and E before being admitted but the care I received was excellent throughout my 5 day stay.
Everyone was so kind to me and the medical attention was wonderful.
I would like to thank every person who played a part in looking after me so well.",5
"Message to management

Childrens A&E. Waited from 8pm to past 3am with 5 yr old to be seen. The staff were obviously busy and working hard, no criticism of them.

Toilets a disgrace, not cleaned once while I was there and didn't look like they had been visted by staff any time in the previous 12 hours.

Waiting room like a juvenile detention centre and thats unkind to detention centres. Hard metal seats too big for a child to sit on comfortably without slipping off and purposely designed so a child can't in any way be comfortable, or rest. It was like torture for him and the other children waiting to be seen.

Next to no information other than an ever increasing wait time even as the number of people in the waiting room decreased.

WiFi didnt work (unfortunately no signal either) absolutely no way of taking his mind off things. Water was available but thats it.

A visit to A&E is rarely planned in advance or with much time to prepare so some sort of other facilities could be useful, even a vending machine and a tv with some cartoons on, something, anything! By the time we were seen the waiting room was almost empty but the wait had gone from 5 hrs to over 8. My child beside himself, beyond exhausted and traumatised.

I'm at a loss for non abusive or offensive words to describe my feelings for you and this experience, probably because there aren't very many fit for purpose, other than abhorrent.

We all know the NHS is struggling but you've actually gone out of your way, and specifically made it so sick and injured children are made to feel worse. What kind of people are you?

You have failed, not only in your directive, but as human beings, hang your heads in shame.

Ps Do not waste your time responding to this with a meaningless generic message. You clearly don't care and we all know it.",1
"The worst hospital ever made. Had infection in my lungs + water inside, took me 7 hours of waiting to get a room not even equipped for my needs. The funniest part my “bed” no pillows , nothing to cover me. The doctor told me i have to do an operation but never heard from him again.",1
"My recent experience at the University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire was extremely disappointing. I came in with a broken leg and was shocked at the lack of care and attention that I received.

Upon arrival, I was told to walk it off and that it was probably just a sprain. Despite my insistence that I was in a lot of pain, the staff were dismissive and uninterested in providing proper care.

When I finally received treatment, the quality of care was subpar. The staff were unprofessional and seemed to be rushing through the process, without taking the time to properly explain the treatment or provide any sort of bedside manner.

The overall cleanliness and hygiene of the hospital were also questionable, with a lack of attention to detail in terms of cleanliness and sanitization.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at the University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire. The lack of care and professionalism was concerning, and I would not recommend this hospital to anyone in need of medical care. The staff need to take the time to properly assess and treat their patients, and ensure that the hospital is clean and hygienic to prevent the spread of infections.",2
"I can't thank the staff enough who helped me with an eye condition - they are doing such a good job, under pressure - someone needs to make sure that these people get more support in the NHS.",5
"Whilst visiting a family member i asked a member of staff if they could fill my babies bottle up with hot water so i can feed him and was told no!

My family member was also left without a pillow and was given folded bed sheets after her surgery to then have another nurse come in open the cupboard to her ""secret stash"" of pillows!",1
"I found a lump on my breast on a Sunday evening. I went to my GP on Monday morning,  I was referred that day.
I had my referred appointment for 11 days later at Coventry University Hospital. The initial reception wasn't great however the breast team were amazing. From chat to exam, straight to mammogram, the ultrasound with a consultant brilliant service x",5
"I went a few times recently, the last time they said, he don't need bloods doing as he was here few days ago, after waiting many hours after triage, I was seen, then the Dr said I need my bloods doing, now that has added more hours that I need to wait. After more hours I was approached by a different Dr, and the previous Dr I seen was still on shift as they already done the shift change, and why would he even ask if its okay talking about my health in the corridor. Some of my bloods were previously super high, but come down a lot. Now he sat me down in a small room, our knee's were virtually touching, which made me very uncomfortable, and he was talking super softly, touching me, saying your okay, it's your worrying that's making your body react, which I acknowledge now, but whys he have to go all feminine on me and be all touchy, with this and not caring for my privacy, it makes me doubt in what he's actually saying and was an overall uncomfortable experience, get a female Dr to do that if they think it's needed that much. Male Dr's should be like, come on, you need to stop worrying, be strong. But he was acting all feminine with me, which freaks you out. And another health problem that I've got, they didn't even bother looking at at all, and it involves slight bleeding. I believe there's a super strong chance that I'll eventually be back again in a couple of weeks and make sure I mention nothing else apart from that other problem, then if other problems, to refrain the temptation in mentioning other problems, I can mention other problems straight after I get fully checked out, and if it includes chest pain, and just see if they send me home with that.
From my experience, it seems their policy is that they only check out what they believe is my main concern. No wonder it's always super busy.",2
"I had an MRI scan today, unfortunately due to peripheral neuropathy I have very limited mobility, however I cannot praise the staff in the MRI scan department enough as they went above and beyond to assist me and make me feel comfortable.  I have had nothing but positive experiences when visiting this particular department.  Well done and thank you.",5
"Why do we pay taxes for health services when you’re told to wait 6-8 hours in A&E when you’re in need of medical assistance for a baby? This hospital is in poor shape & has no staff at all, unwell children waiting for hours and hours on end, your child’s condition will either deteriorate or you’ll get sick of waiting half a day to be seen an end up leaving.

To top it off one of the members of staff on the women’s and children’s department refused to heat up a bottle of milk for my baby when politely asked if they could, just a blunt “nope”, how can you work on a children’s ward when you have no compassion whatsoever for children? You’re a disgusting person who discredits the remaining team on that ward, thankfully a nicer member of staff who doesn’t mind helping distressed parents did kindly warm up our milk for the baby.",1
"Can SOMEONE PLEASE! look at the time it's taking to get a prescription from the internal pharmacy!!! My husband had eye surgery and the prescription was ordered between 10-11am - it took until 4.30pm to finally arrive and then we had to sit and be talked through it all. We didn't leave until 5pm, we were exhausted from the wait and had to pay the full parking charge. The nurse dealing with us was extremely embarrassed and felt really sorry for us. She told us the prescription had been dispensed at 1pm and the further 3.5 hours wait was for it to be checked!! The most inefficient system ever and no signs of improvement as it has been this way for ages. This is why the car park is always full. People are just sat there waiting for their prescription which can't be obtained from any other pharmacy so they have no choice but to wait. If you leave and come back, chances are it's ready and you're not there. You can't win.",1
Honestly I have never seen crazy waiting times in my life than here maternity ward 26&25….nurses are helpful but the doctors take ages to see you….their 15minutes literally means 7hours and I’m not even exaggerating…it’s just crazy I haven’t seen that even in developing countries!!!,1
It is a ridiculous doctor childrenA&E I have been there last Thursday 9. 30a.m. until 5:30 p.m. because of my daughter she is only 5 months she has rash and and all bodies she is a scratching on them they are bleeding after 8 hours in A&E at the end this evening go to your GP,1
"Extremely terrible service, best to avoid it. They are the reason why NHS is failing, even when there is staff available, just not doing their job. You can hear them talk about movies for hours wasting time. No wonder why NHS is in a failed state.",1
"Terrible. No help given to my 95 year old mother. Constant misdiagnosed by medical staff. Did not read previous notes from one doctor to another and could not care in the slightest.
Trying to get through to the ward she was in was also awful. No one answered the phone except once when a voice said ‘we are busy’ and slammed the phone down!",1
"I just wanted to say a huge thank you to the nurses, doctors & all the staff on ward 23.
They looked after me with love, care, compassion, made me feel safe and comfortable at all times. I couldn’t have got through my procedure without them.
I think this hospital is wonderful and I have always been treated with kindness and respect here. We are very lucky for our NHS & the hard work of all the staff, so thank you.",5
"Disgusting.
My dad was transfered from George Eliot as he has an aortic bleed, tried phoning numerous times to see what's happening and if he needs emergency surgery, but no-one answers the phone. Now my daughter and I need to get there to get any news. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.",1
Absolutely disgraceful disgusting dirty place the nurses are brilliant  and the doctors they are worth more than gold give them a rise little angels .... but the cleaners are on there phones all the time .bins in room over flowing  blood on the walls  I was shocked it really needs looking  in to  people  can't do there jobs and it's costing people  dare I say it there lifes from picking  up infections ect  contact points ie doors not being  cleaned  the list goes on and on,1
"Absolutely useless,  do not go if you have a problem with your eyes. My wife has bleeding behind her eyes and the hospital didn't want to know. We shot off to Birmingham eye hospital were we had excellent service and was seen by a doctor in a couple of hours.",1
"Ridiculous A & E with ridiculous security who argued with paramedics, security said I was being aggressive, paramedics said they'd been with me the entire time and I hadn't been in the slightest. Would pick death over hospital next time. Really honestly mean that, not worth the stress and rudeness.",1
"Understandably, I know doctors and nurses are busy. I know it’s gone downhill.
Here’s my story-
Sunday 20th August - my mother fell off the ladder from the attic. Just over 1 metre high. Called 111, told them the concern - recommended us to go to the MIU (Minors Injuries Unit). Turned up at 8pm - then told we should actually be in the A+E unit because the fall from the ladder was over 1 metre.
The lady checking us in said there’s no Elevator to go from MIU ground floor to A+E first floor. But my mother could barely walk. Luckily we found a wheelchair. Getting ourselves prepared to push wheelchair on the ramp which was real far. Luckily, nurse stopped us because there is an elevator but for internal use only. She was atleast helpful.

Turned up at A+E and was seen by the nurse to tell them what had happened to my mum. After that, it was a LONG 13 HOURS! she was not seen by doctors until the next morning on Monday!!
And then she had to be pushed on wheelchair by nurse back down to MIU for an x-ray. To finally be told she had broken her left wrist, 2 toes on each side. To then being wrapped up and finally discharged by 1pm Monday. Literally the WORST wait ever. 13 HOURS TO BE SEEN, THE NEXT DAY!!!  Disgusted by how we were spoken by some nurse when I tried to check her in. And shock by how long it took to see a doctor to be diagnosed with broken bones…",2
"I have been treated in the Intensive Care Unit since Thursday, I’m so shocked about the service it’s Terrible !there is no toilet or shower down there !.the Nurses are so Rude when you ask for something they ignore you they have also ignored me completely !! they wouldn’t even bring me a extra blanket as I’m freezing I have pneumonia !.. they don’t care about the patients and the Cleaning is disgusting  with just water ?? She got some paper towel from the sink and sprinkled it on the floor then mopped !.. no Detol or Bleach they never clean the toilet !…! also most importantly The food is awful Not even cooked ! I haven’t eat since Saturday!?it’s now Monday ! Lived on sandwich keep saying haven’t got this and that I’m so shocked it’s unbelievable how they can have a Hospital like this they all Need to go back to Medical school or even language School as they can’t even talk English actually they can but pretend Not to !.. I’m making a complaint",1
Almost 24 hours to attend a 85 years old diabetic (insulin dependant). She waited on a wheel chair and couldn’t sleep for long time. Unbelievable the lack of humanity.,1
"Worst hospital ever , staff sit around picking their nails & not giving people their blood results , waiting over 10 hours for blood results to come back ! I went through a problem for 6 months with my stomach & got no where with this hospital !! Worst place ever . Meant to care for you but they abandon you & neglect you . Disgusting place , never ever coming back here no matter how ill I am ! They do NOTHING!!",1
"Nothing much to say apart from a PALs that isn’t fit for purpose. Dont leave a message on their phone, as they don’t listen to them. When asked why I didn’t email. Because I want to speak to a human, is classed as rude. A manager who just keeps saying I’m short of staff. I’m sorry I don’t need to know about your staffing issues. Rude Rude Rude.",1
"WORST hospital ever visited. Have been there many times and on many occasions, i have had a bad experience. It also seems that staff are either forgetting common courtesy, talking to you with no privacy or you having to wait way past your appointment time. Maybe the staff are just as fed up as the people in need and don't really want to be there.

VERY expensive parking too. If you don't believe me, feel free to compare the service and amenities with Rugby hospital.

The free 10 minutes parking is a joke. It would take you a lot longer to park, go to reception and ask them a question. Common sense would suggest 25-30 minutes free. Try dropping someone off, helping them to where they need to get to and back to your car and out of the car park. They do have a drop off point now.

Make sure you get to the hospital early as it can be a nightmare getting parked and to your appointment for the right time. Queues are long and can be difficult to get to A&E. Probably better off catching the bus or calling an ambulance.

They had a chance to make this hospital great with underground parking, parks and spaces around the grounds but all you see is cars all over the place with ambulances, staff and patients struggling to get in.

They have tried to improve a bad situation but it is still pretty rubbish. I'm glad there are some good reviews here so not all bad.",2
"It takes forever for you to be attended to.
Update:- when they finally attended to us. The services, nurses,staff were Amazing.  This make up for the earlier disappointment. Thanks so much.",4
"Waited 5 hours, asked how much longer, 3 more hours to wait! Went there with my wife having heart attack symptoms, i had to find transportation because they had no ambulances available. Disgusted and terrified by the punishment they will get from God for being so ignorant!",1
"I was recently admitted as an emergency due an issue with my heart which was confirmed as atrial fibrillation. The care I received was exemplary and my treatment was swift. I stayed in hospital for two nights and during that time i could not fault the staff who attended to me. Upon discharge my meds were clearly explained to me and I was informed what follow up treatment would be required.
I understand that hospital staff are under pressure and work long  hours but i felt i was looked after very well.",5
Absolutely terrible waiting times. Started off with 4 hour wait for doctor increased to 10hours but was Waiting for 12 and more. Nurses lost me on system along with everyone else who had same scan as me. Absolutely terrible,1
"Having just come home from hospital, from calling out for the paramedics to leaving my treatment and care was excellent I have no complaints I even liked the food.We all know hospitals are under staffed but they do there best.",5
"Fantastic care was given by the staff.
The restaurant serves hot and cold food all day.
There is a Subway there too accessed through the restaurant.
There's a Starbucks coffee shop.
W H Smith newsagent and a M n S little food hall.
Across from M n S there is a gift shop that sells clothes, shoes, handbags, and gifts for most occasions.
Outside the main entrance, you will find a fresh fruit n veg stall open most days.
Apart from being gravely poorly it was more pleasant to stay in UHCW than previous experience s.",4
Had an awful experience from start to finish passed from one place to the next no one could help. My partner was charged £4 for parking even though he couldn’t get a space and was driving around for 30 mins whilst I went to the pharmacy,1
I was sent to UHC from George Eliot on Saturday morning I waited 4.5 hours to be seen as only 1 Dr was available and she had to do the ward rounds too. Having said that I was finally seen by Dr Lee who was a lovely Caring young man. He removed a Fishbone from my throat very expertly and gently. I am very grateful to the NHS. Any problems they are having atm are entirely due to this terrible Government.,5
"Understaffed, total lack of communication from all areas. wound not dressed properly, patients ignored, general lack of empathy and total disorganisation. Horrible horrible place. Staff don't communicate with each other and most barely speak English.",1
"I have been to Coventry Hospital on and off constantly since January with ongoing health issues that are deteriorating. Every time I have been I have been asked what I am expecting to happen from today or what I want them to do. They've been unable to give me a diagnosis, the staff have been rude and unsympathetic. I have waited up to 13 hours on some trips to be sent home without any sort of help. I understand they are supposedly understaffed, but that isn't an excuse for attitude problems and poor patient care.",1
"Arrived at A&E at 8.27pm, saw triage nurse at 9.05pm, had bloods & ecg taken at 10.50 then had to wait till 9.45 am the next morning to see a doctor, uncomfortable seats, cold waiting room & dirty toilets, doctor was shocked that we had to wait that long, understaffed doctors, but doctors & nurses are brilliant",1
"Absolutely shocking treatment, worsened my condition by refusing to give me pain relief and refusing to admit me, resulting to another 8 hour wait in a&e. Blatently ignored my condition and nurses clearly over stretched. Dun out.",1
It’s sad that I’m here reviewing the parking of the hospital. No words to describe how despicable and ugly this parking company is which sadly drags in the hospital too. Fined on 2 separate occasions for parking at coventry university hospital when i had paid for it. Unfortunately i had moved house and didn’t know i had been fined until months later to find they are demanding £325 from me even after considering my evidence. Money i do not have. The hospital and this company should be so ashamed.,1
"Visitors or patients’ parking is terrible! Poor parking and traffic management! Can’t get on time by taxi, bus, car and etc. Don’t think that ambulance is via option for all. I think most of parking is for staffs! No comments about hospital and treatment",2
"Easily the worst medical ""care"" I have ever experienced. I had a choice of hospitals to be referred to and this was supposedly the quickest. I know of three other people with a similar issue that had referrals to different hospitals who were treated months ago. Very rarely does the phone get answered, it rings and you get cut off. If it is answered the the relevant department either don't answer and you get cut off or your voicemail message won't be returned. Was told by my consultant I would be treated as urgent, finally spoken to someone after months of trying to call (only able to as pals assisted me) and have been told it's not being treated as urgent and there is another six months wait. So either the consultant lied or someone isn't able to correctly manage lists. This will put me at 14 months of pain! If you have a choice avoid this hospital! If you don't have a choice and have the same issues make use of pals.",1
I took my MIL for an appointment that had been cancelled 3x previously due to staff illness so can't be helped . This time there was so little Blue badge parking and she registered blind . I couldn't get parked so we were happy to go look for regular parking.  There was non at all and so much waiting to park. I had to let her out alone to go into hospital to find clinic alone as a registered blind 90 year old. I eventually got parked and went in to find her . All was well and appointment was only 20 mins late so all good and very nice audiology staff. The parking issues need sorting at this hospital or a local park and ride system needs arranging.  I'm not from this area so not aware of one. The hospital was so so busy I didn't like the feel of it at all. Quite stressful for me . Also toilet signs near entrance point you in wrong way so lots of us walking around and having to ask the way and then queue as only 2 toilets available.  I used to work in the old Walsgrave hospital so this my 1st visit was sad and disappointing.,3
"If I would have an option of 10+ I definitely give it to them. Doctors, nurses, starting from A&E department to surgeons are great, very professional, kindness nurses and surgeons. I was amazed how patient and kind are people who work there. Under these pressures they are working :not enough funding, shortages of nurses, shortages of beds. These people are heroes. I’m very happy of service provided by Coventry university Hospital.",5
Had internal fixation for a tibial plateau fracture in June 2021. Couldn’t be more grateful for the care and treatment I received by the nurses and doctors in what we all know are challenging circumstances.,5
"I have visited twice once for my friend and for my spouse in both the times I had very good response from the staff and good treatment.
I want to thank the staff for their good service.",5
Hearing aid disorders department are not very helpful they don’t help what you need they just take your hearing aid change the tube without permission I told them to give me new hearing  aid as my current one not working very disgraceful services by NHS,1
"I can't thank all the staff enough. For the amazing treatment i have just received from them for the past two days i spent there. Thank you to the staff on Ward 22 who helped me settle in comfortably . I was blown away when a nurse came round at half 12 at night,and quietly asked me if I was okay and if I was in any pain, cheekly I told her I had hunger pains as I hadn't eaten for three days, to my astonishment 15 minutes later she came upstairs with a piping hot cottage pie with a separate portion of carrots and peas I was shocked ,and it was delicious to be honest.  I would mainly like to thank all the remarkable staff team on the day surgery Ward,who treated me with full respect and the best care i could have wished for . Considering these lovely NHS staff are under a lot of pressure and work in a lot of difficult situations, not to mention having to put up with patients who unfortunately can be a tad rude from time to time. From all the nurses,doctors,cleaning staff, security guards and even all the polite staff who work in all the nice shops and restaurants, not to mention the wonderful man outside with his excellent selection of fruit and veg on his stall . There wasn't an upside down smile in sight . I truly hope that this message gets passed over to all the staff .they deserve to be told that there are miracle workers and you can see that each and every one of them are proud of there difficult jobs and it truly shines through. I can honestly say i have never witnessed so much pain before i got referred to Walsgrave Hospital. And didn't think i was going to heal as quick as i did . Amazing i feel better than i have felt for a long time. Obviously i am not completely 100% but  before the wonderful nurse discharged me , she gave me all my medicine, antibiotics and a help chart .and smiled at me and wished me a happy easter . I had a tear in my eye. The reason i feel better than i have done for a while is because . I found genuine people that showed they cared from the moment i stepped into the building .and that means a lot . It's been a difficult time for the last few years for everyone., From getting appointments prescriptions and in all fairness trying to even get through to surgeries on the phone. But this has opened my eyes and made me realise there is help out there .and i know it's hard but we have all gotta have little bit more patience in life.  After all these doctors and nurses have got the patience and time for us and are doing these best . Thank you again for everything … cheryl x",5
"Big thank you to nurses and doctors on 22 & 33 who cared for me on my recent emergency visit.
Despite being what I can only describe as swarmed with patients, the swift care I received was excellent and very much appreciated.
The hospital did look in a state of chaos at times, the sheer number of patients wanting to be seen at once looked unsustainable to me, I'm not sure how as human beings the nurse, doctor, employee at the first point of contact copes and doesn't have a nervous breakdown. Whatever the cause, whoever to blame, something needs to be done. Everyone deserves the same excellent care I received. Again, thank you ward 22 & 33.",5
"I would have given negative stars if given an option. After waiting for over 8 hours, even then I was not able to see the doctor. It took 2 hours to initially book me in and check vitals. Even worse, there is no place to sit, they just let you die in the corridor. Pathetic situation. I could see patients with their nose injured, head injured and bleeding, sitting in front of assessment units and nothing happens. First a Nurse comes and checks your vitals, then another nurse comes and asks your issues, then again trainee doctor comes and questions you, and at last doctor comes and says you are good to go!! My problem is not solved, I have been struggling to for the past 2 months!! NHS scheme is just waste of time and money!! I went to the GP and the GP googles each and every symptom and says ah you got this issue, you got that issue... I mean are they real doctors?? God save us..",1
"My 11 years old daughter was admitted to the hospital twice last year and I’m glad I’ve just found this place to write the review. The A&E service is just disgusting. We’ve been waiting there for 8 hours (only one other small patient was waiting) and 12 hours second time (more busy). The second time when we’ve been there the waiting area was full of poorly, crying children, waiting for hours. My daughter had symptoms of appendicitis and waiting for hours with her in pain was real nightmare . Ps . Please dont leave me message to send me this via email to the hospital. I don’t believe it would change anything in this place !",1
"A&E ok but only if you arrive by ambulance! If you are a walk in, then be prepared for an 6-8 hour wait and be treated like an inconvenience! All aspects of the hospital are totally disorganised and chaotic. No one seems to be accountable! This isn’t a funding issue, it is due to bad organisation and badly trained/demoralised staff. Over a period of three days I witnessed multiple staff duplicating simple duties, many at the determent to their colleagues and whilst giving out conflicting information.They seemed unable to understand and comprehend simple requests and as a consequence confusion reigns.
It took 24 hours delay to obtain a simple prescription from the hospital dispensary prior to discharge, meaning a bed couldn’t be used for another patent. This isn’t acceptable!
A patient is a Customer and we must be treated with humanity and dealt with effectively and efficiently.
Anyone who says the NHS needs more funding should see the waste of resources and inept, inefficient workings at this hospital first! We can’t just keep shovelling more and more money into the NHS, only to see it squandered and wasted with inefficient, poorly trained staff and sloppy working practices. I challenge anyone else who has the misfortune to be in this hospital to come to any other conclusion.
Sadly this hospital is not fit for purpose! Criminal waste of resources on an industrial scale resulting in very, very poor patient care.
We all deserve so much better than this!",1
"You could be dying and either no one answers the phone or when you walk in, the nurses still won’t see you. Between the hundreds of calls we’ve placed, and the constant rescheduling of appointments (on their end), you’re literally dead. Wife told them numerous times she is not feeling well and after 100 checkups/ appointments, she’s been diagnosed with cancer. Maybe if the management/ nursing team did a better job, we would have had a better chance for early detection and beat this disease! The UK government / health system has failed us.",1
"This Hospital is an absolute disgrace. Particularly the Renal Department. Nobody answers the phone and even after leaving 4 messages, NOBODY responds or calls back. Beware of the lies you will be told. They advise calling the Renal department when the need arises. This is all lies. Nobody answers the phone. What is the point of even having a phone number for the Renal department if nothing happens, even after multiple messages are left?
This also begs the question, what exactly are these people doing?
When questioned in person, they just dismiss the point and simply use the word, sorry. That's not good enough. If anyone from the Renal Department is reading this, you should be ashamed of yourselves for point blank lying to patients and pulling the wool over their eyes. If you cannot do what you say or don't want to, just say so, instead of giving false hope and lies to vulnerable elderly patients. There isn't even any point using the PALS service as they are even more useless. All they do is give a standard cut and paste response.",1
"The standard of care simply equates to utter neglect. My father waited 4 days for an urgent operation for a bleed on the brain. The after care was shocking with incorrect drips, no physio and a previously fit man left to struggle to the toilet himself, whilst soaked in urine. I did not feel safe leaving him there in their ""care"". Urine was left for hours on the ward floor with nurses simply stepping over it. I was unable to clean it myself due to the empty bottles of disinfectant.

The follow up care was equally terrible. No physio or check up for weeks then a follow up scan showing bleed on the brain  was either missed or not looked at for 3 weeks. Resulting in another rush to A and E and emergency surgery.

If it wasn't for astute family care, elderly patients would just decline/die if left to this system

It was not simply lack of staff, but obvious inefficiency, lack of competence from nurses and consultants alike.",1
"I was super scared to go to this hospital because of the reviews I’ve read. However, all people there were very nice. Dr Day who was checking my lump was very pleasant and has a personal approach, very happy to meet him. An appointment was delayed for half of an hour but it is ok as in whole I spent approximately an hour in this hospital including doctor’s check and ultra sound check.",5
PARKING..So I go to pay for parking and it declines my card 3 times. Then in a matter 2mins it then excepts my card and changes me an extra 70p due to the time. Now I'm guessing this was done on purpose to gain extra cash. My card worked straight away this morning on the same machine. 🤔,1
I just want to say a huge thank you to the children’s a&e department especially Mandy .. we can’t thank you enough for the amazing care you gave our daughter last night. You all work so hard and regardless of how busy the department was your care was above and beyond. Also the ambulance crew what a amazing job you do!!!,5
"It's a big hospital. It's operated by NHS. There are thousands of people working really hard. That includes doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics, drivers, cleaning staff, maintenance, security and what not. They are really busy and they are overwhelmed, so cut them some slack. They don't want you there anymore than you want to be there. They would like to fix you asap and get you gone. So if you have a cut on your finger, put a plaster on yourself. Check how much you have to pay on private treatment before you complain.
Parking however, is an absolute nightmare. It's not enough, and really expensive if you do find a place. Nearly same price as some major airports. My advise, take a bus.",4
I went to minor emergency department booked in by 111 this was at 2am. Went to A &E first then a lovely porter lady wheeled me down to this new department minors on ground floor. Was seen quickly very impressed clean and tidy looking lovely staff as they wheeled me back to my car.,5
"Avoid at ALL costs. Three occassions I have been to this hospital. First occassion I arrived via ambulance with a acute shoulder dislocation, left in a corridor for 8 hours no pain relief... second occasion my pregnant partner was told possible breast cancer and sent home after 11 hours with antibiotics. 3rd occasion, spent 8 hours in A&E in severe stomach pain whilst given x1 paracetamol that was instantly thrown up. Turns out CDIF digestive infection which is HIGHLY Contagious, sat around A&E spreading my germs to innocent patients. Went from a 5 hour wait, to 15 hour wait to even see a medical expert. Some staff was lovely. Others stressed and Rude to patients. Gentleman in A&E collapses infront of me violently fitting, yet other patients waiting offered care instead of any medical personal. You'll die in this place before you ever get better. Drive to Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham instead, proper hospital. Oh and more than likely you'll get parking charges and/or fines on hospital ground or around it. £300 later.",1
"Ward 52 could not be more disappointing. They never pick up the phone when multiple people in a family phone to see how an 86 year old lady is doing. It is midday and we currently have no idea how she is doing and whether or not she has had hip surgery (we also got told yesterday she had the surgery but she got “confused” with another patient). I understand you are all busy but we are a very worried family who are being completely left in the dark. For my family’s sake, please start picking up the phone.",1
Can not give enough praise for the staff in this hospital. Absolutely amazing. Thank you,5
"Absolute shambles, the permanent staff try their absolute best 5 stars unfortunately SOME of the casual/agency staff do the bare minimum.

If your attending A&E &or MDU expect it to be 8-14hrs to see your first doctor this is the usual in these departments if you’re lucky! With no estimated time of seeing a doctor at all.

The hospital could give you a better and more regularly updated idea of wait times in this day and age. I think it would be possible to estimate wait times, even if it is constantly changing and they could do better to care for patients who are left on a chair for 14hrs maybe refreshments that are topped up regular rather than every change over!

A NHS hospital on its knees and it’s really shows people suffering in corridors and waiting rooms government set on letting the nhs crumble. Reliable health care is for the rich only it seems.",1
"Most of the nurses and staff were nice and helpful. However I was really disappointed by the rude and arrogant behaviour of a doctor at the minor injuries ward. When my brother and I came in with our mum to get her treated for a severe pain she was experiencing. The doctor asked so many questions like why were we there and why didn't we call 111, and that we shouldn't be there unless it was an injury. My brother tried to explain that, however the doctor interrupted him saying that he was ""educating"" him and that if it isn't an injury we should call our GP in the morning. As her severe pain started at night. We came to the hospital at midnight and waited for nearly 4 hours, as the doctor was taking time we decided to leave and call her GP in the morning to seek help. My point is that if a person is in an unbearable severe pain, where should he/she go to seek treatment ?
While the doctor was saying that we should've waited until the morning to call our GP, as it wasn't an "" injury"", my mum was crying and  couldn't walk because of the pain prior to our arrival at the hospital. There was no need to ""educate"" us as we knew what we were doing, something that any reasonable person would do when they would see a person in severe pain or distress. I am ""educated"" enough to know that doctors take an oath to serve patients to their best and treat them respectfully. Anyway we complained about this arrogant and rude behaviour at the reception of the minor injuries ward and they apologised for it. I hope this feedback helps you ""educate"" the staff on how to behave with patients.",2
I have had some bad experiences before here but today dr Leo  and the staff was so nice with me and  the hospital was super clean .,5
"Back in October I had a back surgery there after being told nothing was wrong with me to then having a slipped disc .. the whole time in there was horrible I was there for around two weeks and all the staff apart from 2 were horrible . One pulled my canula out and made my arm pour with blood after I asked for some pain relief.  I asked for some water as my jug was empty I was waiting 6 hours for water . I was not allowed out of bed and I asked for some help to move as I was not able to alone and was left crying with no help for 4 hours, they were not helpful at all!!!!!",1
"Hello I was taken to this hospital in 2009 with respatory problems later was diagnosed to be swine flu with many other under lying issues like phunemoa and sepsis and put on a ventilator for almost 2 weeks with a 50 percent chance of survival and can clearly say if it wasn't for the help and dedication by the medical team in A E
I wouldn't be here today I am very grateful for there help and understand that hospitals can be very busy and stressful for staff and patients and visitors

Along time before the COVID 19 outbreak
Thanks

"we waited 8 hours to see the doctor with a newborn baby who couldn't breathe, the receptionist replied ""we are busy""",1
"Went to A&E this Tuesday, and was seen promptly by a very sweet doctor. He was making jokes and seemed to appreciate my dark sense of humour a bit, and overall made my experience a better one. Only down side is I keep getting texts asking to rate UHCW, but it costs to reply. If it was free I'd give 5 stars, but being charged for a review seems odd.",5
"I’ve just spent 14 long and horrendous hours in A and E, only to have my bloods taken and the results analysed for diagnosis. I was referred by my GP for an emergency MRI scan.. I even queued for over an hour to register my details at reception, from 17.15hrs yesterday evening and finally paid the rip off £11.00 charge for parking at 07.20hrs this morning.
This is my first ever time using this hospital and couldn’t believe the things I was witnessing…Patients awaiting triage, lying  on the waiting room floor, crying and in obvious distress. There was insufficient seating. A young gentleman, limp and almost looking lifeless in a wheelchair,  supported by a family member with all the room staring at them. Total lack of respect and dignity shown.
There was also quite a lot of vomiting going on..
A lady, left on a trolley in the waiting room, with staff, recognising their mistake too late, transferring her on to a wheelchair in the reception area.
On countless occasions,  patients were called for triage, or to see the doctor,  had already voted with their feet and discharged themselves rather than wait any longer.. Yes seriously!!
A member of staff made the quip that all these AWOL patients would help us all remaining, to be seen much quicker!
I saw a gentleman having his bloods taken whilst sitting on a chair amongst other patients waiting..
The constant grief that the fantastic front line staff took from people in general must have been soul destroying for them. As a result they often seemed on the defensive and were sometimes ‘offish’ when patients approached them for updates on waiting times etc.
When I enquired why the waiting times were so long I was told that there were too many patients..!!
People that turned up for assistance in the small hours left when they were greeted by the nurse “There’s an 8 hour wait to see a doctor”
Surely if you can’t staff it.. Close it?
I wonder if any of the above contravenes any fancy written patient’s charter or  hospital commitments to deliver quality patient services?
Can I suggest that the overpaid monkeys at the top of this ‘organisation’ sit in their A and E department , overnight for 14 hours ( doing nothing) and just maybe the pennies might  hopefully drop?
The national target for A and E stands at 4 hours, in my case (and for a lot of others) it was over 14 hours…
I’m hoping that I will never have to visit this place again.",1
"Breast screening experience.
When I phoned to make an appointment for breast screening, the person who took the call was very abrupt and impatient with me.
A few days later, I received a letter to go for further tests. When I arrived at the breast screening department on the 18/10/22 I was greeted by an unwelcoming, abrupt and
uncaring receptionist, not just me but everyone that arrived or asked for information. I was then
roughly grabbed and manhandled by the radiographer before my mammogram which was very painful and distressing.
Having said that, the Doctor I spoke with was very friendly, cheerful and caring as were the Radiology staff performing my biopsy who treated me with respect and dignity, thank you.",3
"Had an appointment for CT Scan for my Mrs. Mrs gets changed and sits in the waiting area just outside the scan room. When her turns comes I had to be present with her when the details are being confirmed as she has problem with english ubderstanding. She goes into Scan room and I stood outside there to make sure if I am needed to interpret. It was like 30seconds the receptionist comes and very rudely says "" you are not supposed to be here "" .
She could have asked me to wait outside while the Scan was being done which I would be doing any how.

Is that the way to address some one or they do it to everyone.

Just becuase it was hospital and I dont wanted to create a scene out of it I kept quite and came out straight away.

Very disappointed, a person who is in hospital is already in stress , at least try to be considerate of that.",1
"I had a terrible reaction to medication and felt that an artery in my brain would burst at any moment. while taking my pulse, the nurse said that I was fine, that I must have a cold. no professionalism, no humanity, everything happened on the 24th of May around 2 o'clock in the morning.",1
"Myself and husband had to attend a&e on early 1st of January. We waited 5/6 minutes for a nurse led clinical triage at the door and swiftly sent to MDU downstairs in the main building. My husband was checked in within 5 minutes. It was clear on the board the wait to see a clinician would be 15/20 minutes and to see a doctor if needed 3&1/2 hours . Thankfully my husband’s condition was diagnosed quickly and efficiently and between seeing 3/4 clinicians for different tests etc could leave after pretty much 3&1/2 hours just to return for medication later that day . Hats off to all those receptionists , HCA’s , Staff nurses and Doctors who are working tirelessly, obviously under immense pressure to deliver the care they do with kindness, compassion & professionalism and patience! Thank you .",5
"I was for the first time in this hospital and I was amazed how professional and fast they took care of my sister. And the nurse was amazing, had a lot of  patience with us and explain the procedure and speak with the doctor's for us. A wonderful woman and nurse. Thank you Michelle Giorgiu.",5
"Overall excellent treatment from staff who were enthusiastic, friendly, kind and caring. Doctors and nurses made you feel at ease, and the ward assistants were also very good. Only a couple of moans, night staff could be a bit elusive especially when one elderly gentleman needed assistance, and the dreaded parking issues. Arriving in the day you are lucky to find a space and the ticket machines aren't very clear about what you do, the display vanished before we completed the trans action. The charges are ridiculously high for hospital visits.",4
I spent 4 hours at the walk in centre to be told to attend a and e for a chronic condition  I arrived at a and e with gp letter and was sent to the medical assessment unit  I then waited a further four hours to be then told i faced a further eight hour wait all whilst in a great deal of pain  I understand they are under pressure and more urgent cases must take priorty but that was just too long to sit in pain on hard chairs with one doctor on duty.,1
Thank you to Dr Prasad and the doctor that was with him on 19 may (ENT) and the amazing nurses and assistants on ward 10 and not forgetting the anaesthetist team. Amazing hospital and the NHS should be very proud of you all!,5
"My Aunt was taken in today with sepsis, we knew it was futile from her underlying health condition. The treatment from Hazel the registrar in A&E and the team was outstanding. The care and compassion my aunt received before she passed away pain free and peacefully was outstanding and I thank them all.",5
You can ring the phone number all day long to see how a patient is but no one ever answers the phone so how can you check to see how a patient is doing to stop you worrying about them. And some staff very rude. All the negatives need sorting,1
"Such a disappointment on never ending wait at emergency. My 3 years old son is having a swollen knee and the skin has turned blue. I waited for almost 3 hours and when I asked the nurse about my turn, she told that I still have 4+ more hours to wait till a doctor sees my son. It that what we call “emergency”?
After a period of time we as parents started feeling sick and getting backache. Highly disappointed with the level of health service. I specifically told to triage nurse that my son is limping since yesterday and he can’t even bend his leg due to immense pain. The poor kid was sleepy like anything and we have to leave the hospital with my untreated son. THIMBS DOWN! I wish I could give negative star rating.",1
Emergency gynaecology Unit make my us to wait more than 6 hours when it is actually emergency. I have visitied 1st time and had a very bad experience even though there is no que in the waiting room. Instead of helping of patients to recover it is making worst possible situation to happen.,1
"Easy to find and easy to park.  Last time I went I waited in the car park.  This time I waited in the reception area and was well impressed with such a clean and pleasant environment.  Bright and airy, plenty of seats, well equiped with lots of space.  Modern, bright, colourful and cheerful.  I must say its one of the best I've seen in a long time.  Thankfully I don't get to visit many different hospitals, but this one really made a pleasant impression on me. Lots of useful information in the reception area.  What a wonderful idea to have a fruit stall outside too.  The best way to encourage healthy eating and so convenient for visitors of patients to take them some fruit.  Once again, very easy to find a parking space, which is very rare with most hospitals.   Well impressed!",5
"OMG was at the hospital last night for approximately 3 and half hours suspected blood clot, thankfully it wasn’t. The staff in the MDU department from check in to triage to doctors and nurses the whole experience was lovely they are such a lovely lovely team.
I’d like to send them chocolates and a thank you card as they so well deserve it and more.
Hats off to the NHS and long may it last.
Patrick",5
"My son got admitted to the hospital because he catch a very nasty chest infection.
They wrongly admitted him with wrong NHS number.
My son has been revived by endocrinology for 8 years & they still recognise him.
They don’t have clear emergency plan for him on the system & they don’t have any clue how to deal with his medical condition.
Horrible experience for us as a family.
Still he is in the hospital.

Not recommended.",1
"Staff were mostly all amazing last time I was in hospital, I came last night to the minor injuries unit, where we were not happy with how staff treated other patients, rude and very unprofessional, pulling faces and having attitude to confused patients asking questions. No need to be so rude to people in pain who require help  I was disgusted if I'm honest, poor guy could hardly speak English and didn't understand the waiting process, staff told him with attitude to wait like everyone else, to sit down and he will be seen when they are ready while pulling disgusted faces at him... meanwhile a child is allowed to play tiktok videos full blast giggling laughing his head off uncontrolled by his mother who yhen put her headphones in to a avoid listening to him, he's sitting in seats, moved someone's sandwich, and was a nuisance. I know this isn't the responsibility of the staff but some respect and quiet signs would be nice or no mobiles... regaress the care and treatment wad great, just didn't like how staff treated certain individuals.

Waiting for xray results was longest part  some improvement of the process could be improved if possible.. must be a faster process I feel its staff being lazy...

No water machine while the room is like a sauna.

After staff change, for an hour nobody was attended to. All running around seemingly unprepared.

The person in control of the process and procedure of the unit could be majorly improved.

Thanks for the service most nhs staff provide regardless of some of my comments mist of you are lovely",3
"Huge thanks to Lisa in reception of Day Surgery, who made the recent 8 hour wait for my father's operation very bearable. Bags of empathy, patience and kindness.",5
"A large teaching hospital servicing mainly Coventry and the surrounding area.

It has a wide variety of medical specialties and the staff are friendly and helpful.

It also has an M&S, Subway, Costa coffee, canteen type restaurant called The Restaurant and several smaller places serving snacks and coffee onsite.

PS Nomination form now  completed and submitted.",5
"I was in Day Surgery Unit, just last Saturday. My appointment time was 07:30, I was greeted by a cheerful mature Ward Clerk, followed by a Male charge nurse. After the pleasantries, I was taken to the ward area and was shown where my bed was. All of the staff from the ISS domestic to the Consultant surgeon made me feel at ease. Then I met the theatre staff who were as above. We started talking about cakes with the Anaesthetists team, mainly mince pies. They told me that I will not remember this conversation once I come out of the surgery. Mince pies!
I was taken to recovery, someone was holding my hand (warm hands), was offered a drink of water. Taken back to the ward and was welcomed like a close friend. I was offered plenty of food. My lovely nurse explained everything and advice me to take plenty of fluids,  fiber, Lactulose and Senna. My incision was glued instead of sutures, it is going to be harder to milk it but quicker recovery. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all involved directly and indirectly for my care. We're all so very lucky to have the NHS.",5
left me 7 hours with nothing but paracetomol and a half arsed xray only to be told i need to go birmingham (even though the paramedics said this from the get go) 9 days and 2 surgerys later finally on the mend despite having severe nerve damage in my fingers. (wouldnt have been the case if they dealt with me quickly) disgrace of a hospital AVOID IF YOU CAN,1
"I’ve had so many visits to the Women and Children’s, and I have so much respect for the medical professionals who took care of me. They’re caring, understanding, and respectful. I know how extremely busy they are because I saw it from both sides of different wards. They really did everything they could to help me. I can’t say ‘thank you’ enough to those doctors, nurses, and midwives. I wish more people could understand how short-staffed they are and wish the government could provide more resources and fundings to the NHS!!!",5
"Maternity services were shocking from start to finish. During pregnancy given conflicting information and appointments. During labour given the same, when it came to active labour I was treated horribly by the allocated night midwife to the point I became extremely distressed during giving birth. Afterwards when my son was born the treatment on the ward wasn't much better. I wouldn't use this hospital again for it's maternity services, I would rather travel further for hopefully a better experience.",1
"The surgical assessment ward is the most pathetic unit caz none of the staff members have a proper communication among themselves and don't even care. I've had a problem with my nose bone recently and was referred for a surgical assessment 2 weeks later. I had my appointment at 8:30am and I was on time. There was no receptionist around and some doctor without looking at my prescription form asked me to head to clinic 10 for no absolute reason. When I went there, the receptionist had absolutely no clue why I was there when I had to be in the SA ward. After wasting 2 hrs , they inspected my ears when the problem was with my nose bone. And when I went back to the SA ward with that absolutely useless hearing test result, the receptionist Informs me to wait for 3-4 hours caz they are all busy just get my nose bone checked!! Since I had no major blockage in the nasal area, I thought of going back since I couldn't waste another 4hrs waiting. It's like they don't even care if you do not have a major injury. And the worst part is they don't give you an appointment and I can't even meet the doctor who first attended me when I was there with the injury. Pathetic unit and crazy people!!",1
Rude and unsympathetic staff. Doctors asking patients what treatment they expect without any diagnosis. All those years of training and to not be able to treat a patient and the audacity to claim they are underpaid. UHCW is without a doubt a waste of resources.,1
"Worst A&E experience of my life. 12 hours wait and still not seen a doctor. Came in via ambulance too. Uncomfortable metal seats, no beds available, no food and no water. Never again will I use this place. You need to be under special measures!",1
"My husband was taken by ambulance to be assessed by mental health. He can’t string a sentence together, focus on people and is clearly having some kind of breakdown. After a ‘quick chat’ they thought it was fine to send him home, on a bus, by himself. They just didn’t want to know. I know there is a lack of funding and resources but it’s so clear he needed help.",1
You are a total joke! Someone involved in an accident and none of the doctor is willing to see the patient. Said waiting for more than 6 hours in an emergency section is normal. Well done!,1
"Pretty good as they go.
As with most hospitals, parking can be hit and miss, do your research and if you can, do a dry run so you know where you are going before you need to be on time for an appointment.",4
I would like to know why when your consultant sees you in clinic and diagnosis a problem wich with a xray would confirm you just carnt have one instead of him having to send you to accident and emergency for a average 15 to 20 hour wait sometime even longer than that just for them to confirm what the consultant stated about 20 hours before hand the situation is in my opinion absolutely disgusting and totally unacceptable. I myself will now never visit that department again as I found the staff's and the department totally unacceptable,1
"I went, last night, to the ER because I twisted my ankle and the 111 operator booked me in. I was amazed by the service of this hospital. I went in very quickly, checked in and a lovely woman took me to the minor injuries with a wheelchair, as I was unable to move due to the pain. The doctor came really fast asked me some questions and booked me for an X-ray. All the staff were very polite and tried to help me the best way they could. The hospital was super clean, well equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and it was very easy to find your way through the signs. I had a great experience and I had never been to such an organised public hospital in my life.",5
"The nursing staff at the minor injury’s unit were very kind and supportive however the doctor was careless I went in with a broken wrist which not only did he not manage to fix properly but that he made worse. I took family with me. The doctor gave some pain relief, from what I could see today he had pierced the skin right through to the other side. My family are thinking of sadly taking further action",2
"Hello
I had a bad experience in this hospital. Admitted to MDU . Spent 2 nights on a trolley as they were looking for bed to transfer me. During my stay in MDU they didn't allow visitors and I was thirsty nobody could give me water in the side room as I had malaria.  They stated that i have the iv fluid running when my wife complained over the phone.  I didn't have any swallow problems, I don't know how the iv fluid could replaced the thirst. In total I spent 4 nights in the hospital but nobody never give me a toothbrush or a gown to change the jeans 👖 that I was wearing since my admission. They don't care about patients.  I don't really know how elderly patients are coping there.
Worse experience 😪",1
"I took my adult son to A&E last night (sun/10/22) we waited about an hour to be seen (which was fine) it was very busy. We were both grateful for the care received.  Thank you to all concerned.
What struck me the most was the lady who was in the a&e reception meeting and greeting patients. She was outstanding in her efficiency . It was very busy as I said and this lady made her work look like a breeze ! ( I know it wasnt) she was friendly and caring to people whilst also extremely busy. This lady epitomizes the word Nurse , she really did. Praise where praise is due. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but I hope she knows she was noticed and applauded for her service.",5
My mum is Amber pathway some of the staff on ward 22 are so rude today I had to help a male Hca change her as he was going to do this himself as they have no staff... I also had to ask them to get a slide sheet as the nurses was going to drag lift her!! Disgusting... There has been no yellow bags for two days... They don't change there white aprons when leaving room.,1
"Was made to feel it was my fault that they were unable complete the test I was there for. To add insult to injury I have been sent a parking fine of a £100.00  this is after following the instructions of the parking attendant to copy the information off my BLUE BADGE and registering my details with the security office, I have appealed but so far no answer.",1
My wife just had an appointment here and she said she was pleased with their service.,4
"My mum has had a electrocardiogram and is due another one.  When I've contacted the Cardiology departments at the hospital by phone they have been very helpful even though I know they must be busy   Some staff, if they can't help, they try their best to.  One person in particular, Dheep, who works with Dr Khan has been really kind and helpful over the phone.",5
"I arrived 40 minutes early for my appointment at 2.30pm.  Good job I did, I spent 35 minutes driving round the hospital car parks looking for a parking space.  There were cars everywhere crawling round looking for a space, and when I did find one I was charged from time of entry to that car park, which I'd been in for 20 mins waiting for a space. All the security staff I saw were on their phones, no car park full signs in use, no traffic direction and nowhere near enough spaces.  I can't fault the staff or treatment once I finally got into the hospital.",1
Yesterday I had a pre op assement at clinic6 and 7 and the staff were lively  Micheal in clinic 7 was such a supportive and kind person. I wanted him to be publicly thanked for looking after me so well in my ECG,5
I recently had a stroke threat. I was admitted to the TIA clinic and then to the Stroke ward where I was put through several tests which led to surgery. I was treated with professionalism and skill. I was most struck by the compassion and kindness of all of the staff.,5
"I didn't realise you could leave reviews.  So I'll give my experience.  Nurses that are more interested in their phone than patient care.  I was brought in as an emergency, despite being told I was vulnerable they tried to put me amongst other patients.  (Saves cleaning I guess).  I detest this hospital, they don't care.  Which was blatantly obvious on discharge.  When it was Walsgrave hospital my review would have been the opposite.
Those that are in and out maybe different but when you're ""stuck"" with their so called care, well, good luck!  No towels, soap, toothpaste etc until the day I left.  I'm lucky I took my own.
Hideous place, bar the rare caring nurse.  No wonder the NHS has charity support.  UHCW needs a rethink, better still, make St Cross a fully functioning hospital again.  A shame of the NHS.",1
Nursing staff on cancer ward useless very lazy sister in this hospital dying of cancer being sick left her with sick all down her and over bed sheets never bothered to change sheets and wash her down digusting,1
Didn’t feel safe as a patient. Had a car accident and was in A+E. Couldn’t move my legs at the time. A visitor kept trying to access my personal belongings such as my phone. I had to keep hold of my phone. He kept trying to approach me. The doctor was also insensitive: “It looks like you were in an accident.” Didn’t even bother reading my notes. Then I was bothered by a student claiming to be a fully fledged doctor who wanted to check my legs. After poking and prodding them he disappeared. In summary a horrible hospital. Zero stars if I could.,1
"Elderly care ward, ward 20 Natalie in the blue uniform spoke so off hand and rudely to me without making eye contact. I appreciate you are busy but please be kind to patients families.

Edit
9th September
In complete contradiction recently ALL the staff on ward 43 were amazing and kind to both my mother as a patient and me as a visitor. Thank you",2
"Worst hospital ever.
Treated mum who died of breast cancer last year (not MacMillan they were fab) disgustingly so much so she moved to Warwick & Straford Hospital and now I'm having the same abysmal service with my eyesight retinopathy (I'm diabetic).
Nothing works. No essential communication happens. Left hand doesn't know what the right hands doing. Ridiculous!",1
"If you can choose to give a birth between Coventry and Warwick choose Warwick! I was well prepared for my labour, but I was not prepared for the fact that my Partner won't be allowed with me! This was disgrace that on Ward 24 they don't have enough midwifes to do examination to check up where you are. The midwifes arguing with you during the contractions, saying that the Partner is not allowed but you can still see him outside the ward (what is the point?). They were saying that this is government rules but in Warwick they let Partner to be with you during the whole process!!
Postnatal.. again awful! Rude staff, new moms crying because cannot move, walk, having infections but have been told to be mobile! The only midwife that was great on the postnatal was Allanagh. I was waiting whole day for her night shift because she was so nice, helpful and explained everything what is going on and what is the plan. The rest.. I leave it without comment. Regarding ward 24 - only students were nice and helpful..
The labour ward staff was great I fell I was in good hands.
And car park is awful - my husband paid for his tickets each time when he came to see me and the company is trying to charge us £100. We have all tickets but this is still not enough for them!!",2
Appalling wait time. Was well over 12 hours before a doctor even saw us. And 3/4 hours between each blood draw and scan. Just sat there for ages with no information and if you did ask the receptionist said they didn’t know anything and made no effort to help patients find answers to simple questions. A truly exhausting Awful experience.,1
"My Goodness. I was trying to reach the Surgical Assessment Ward as my Daughter is an inpatient on that unit. I am trying to contact the Ward since 3PM and still no Luck. I managed to contact the SAU and spoke to male staff who told me that my daughter is not their patient. He then searched my daughter's details  and found out that my daughter was with them and was now transferred from their unit to the surgical assessment ward. I have kindly asked the male staff to transfer my call but was not successfull because he decided to end the call.  Until now, I have not spoken to any of the Nurses from that ward to be able get some updates😡🤬🤬",1
"Tale of two halves. Some nursing and healthcare staff were amazing and I will always be grateful for the care they gave to my late father.  However, when he passed away on Tuesday, the nursing staff left us standing in the corridor moments after he passed, asking ""what do you want to do now?""

Furthermore, we were given my father's belonging, except his wallet that was kept in the safe. We were told we needed to return to the hospital the next day to collect that. There's no way to get it without making us return. When we got home, we found we'd also been given the belongings of another patient. We had his clothes, travel pass, debit card and a £10 note.

We contacted the hospital as soon as we were aware. My brother returned it to the hospital the next day, after spending the day contacting people about our fathers death. Waiting in queues to return the other man's belongings and waiting for people to answer doors for over half an hour, he was told it had just gone 4pm and the office was now closed. Despite him seeing people in the office, explaining what happened and that we'd lost our father the previous day, he was told they couldn't help and to come back again the next day.

So thanks UCHW for making a difficult time even more difficult. I hope you never have to go through that when you lose a loved one",1
Absolute horrendous experience. 7 hours of being passed from childrens a and e to minor injuries then back to a and e. After triaged within 20 minutes no communication. Taken off system after waiting for 5 hours then added back on told next next waited for hours. Left in a room with other families who should have been seen within 3 hours final assessment done in 10 minutes after waiting for over 7 hours. No listened to.,1

They tried thier best to communicate with her and made her more comfortable.

Thanks to u all.",5
"Really bad experience in MDU today Mon 26th Sept - parents had been waiting for 11hours in this dept  with hardly any information or fed any food or drinks to meet their dietary requirements being coeliac and diabetic. Never informed as to what the next steps were. The were yo-yoing for many hours between triages, nurses and clinicians and the waiting times on their white board were way behind on accuracy …about 3hrs behind. We are still here without any telephone reception or explanation and if u ask the receptionist…you get ur head bitten off for asking why it’s taking so long!!  Not acceptable especially for the patients and it goes to show that this is completely broken system…. Don’t know how much more long we have to wait to get to the next stage and I’d dare not ask again and get a loud aggressive response back!! Worth making a formal complaint about this dept and alert other users to be prepared for the worst ☹️☹️",1
"my wife of 57 years died due to medical negligence .after 4 years the hospitals legal representatives on the hospitals  behalf admitted the care she received was substandard and on the balance of probabilities she is likely to have survived if the percutaneous tracheostomy procedure had been done properly!! .She spent 5 weeks 4 of which she was sedated in the cardiac icu when myself and family were at her bedside when she passed .The CORONER at the inquest to her death was very critical of the procedure ""The whole procedure was out of control from beginning to the end"" The CONSULTANT who attempted the procedure was also criticised within the hospitals own SERIOUS INCIDENT internal investigation report.there are other doctors who were responsible for her care need to search their concience  and make shure when they complete medical notes that they are CORRECT!! The consultant responsible for her death is still employed by the hospital !!! Finally I have to thank all the amazing nursing staff working in that icu unit during my late wifes stay 5/2/2018 to 9/3/2018",1
The minor injuries unit at this hospital is amazing. Went in at 13:15 and treated and ready to leave after only 2 hours. Staff are friendly and compassionate. Very satisfied with my care.,5
"After being taken into a&e by ambulance with 2 very good paramedics who cannulated me in my bedroom due to a fever in excess of 40 along with symptoms that gave me great discomfort. I was triaged quickly but left to wait for 4 hours in severe pain. Following this I asked the receptionist an estimation of how many people were before me in terms of being seen, he proceeded to tell me 8 when there wasn’t even 8 patients in the waiting room, this was said without concern when telling him of my pain along with no empathy for the situation I was in.

Additonally the waiting time on the display screen had increased to 7.15hrs on top of the 4hrs that I had already been waiting, after hearing this I decided to discharge myself due to the lack of concern shown towards me along with being situated in a waiting room that is extremely uncomfortable to wait in due to my severe neck and back pain that I was experiencing. When asking to discharge myself the receptionist pointed to a door and told me to get my IV cannulation removed, upon getting removed the nurse that discharged me roughly attempted to remove the plaster surrounding the cannula causing me extreme discomfort that led me to ask her to stop, she allowed me to remove the plaster at my own comfort and she swiftly removed the cannula and told me to apply pressure with the dressing that she had handed me (without explaining how much pressure to apply).

Overall, I agree with other reviews left in regards to the fact that the child ER should not be treated as an emergency room if 10+ hour waits are expected on a quiet day. I would not use or recommend this hospital to anyone !!!",1
"Had an operation last week. Appointments were set up well in time leading up to the operation. On the day, I was given my own room, and the staff were amazing. Although it was meant to be a day operation, my appointment ended up being late, and I was kept over night, but I was looked after very well, and discharged promptly the next morning. Nurse Maryam Noor was one of the many brilliant nurses.",5
"I am currently sat in A&E and they have placed a lady in a wheelchair in just a gown which is not done up at the back right by the door on this freezing morning. With concern I ask the lady who was monitoring the main waiting area. If she had been checked on as it was freezing her response was well she talks English.. I said okay but is she warm have you checked, she assured me she was comfortable after checking on her a minute ago. Due to how cold I felt I thought I'd ask her myself, she told me she was freezing this really upset me so I went and found someone to get her a blanket she was left for a long time before receiving any assistance",1
"If you have a life threatening condition you might as well write your will whilst you wait, the place is just infested with either criminals in shackles or crackheads trying to score, the reception staff couldn’t give less of a F that you’re there, ended up leaving without the results after 8 hours of waiting. I’d rather die than sit in that dump another second.",1
"The treatment and nursing care you get at this hospital is first-class . . . it can not be faulted, but the parking situation at this place can be perverse and cruel. A hospital should be a place for thoughtful care, reference the amazing staff at this hospital.
However, people who go to the hospital obviously  have a health issue, therefore the tension can be quite high, especially if you are booked in for an operation.

You enter a small reception area at a place where there is a drop-off zone. The people with you hunt for a place to park. After your day surgery you pay £7.20 at one of the payment machines. It only takes cash so you can’t get a receipt to confirm your legitimate payment.
A week later a letter comes through the post . . . It is a parking fine, sixty quid if you pay within a certain period, a hundred quid if you pay afterwards.

A hospital’s ethos, led by the chief administrator, should be to help people get through a health crisis NOT TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF THEIR ILLNESS. BE CAREFUL PARKING WHEN YOU VISIT THIS HOSPITAL. THE PARKING ORGANISATION THEY USE IS OUT TO GET YOUR MONEY, NOT TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR ILLNESS, WHICH COULD BE VERY SEVERE.
It would show understanding of his/her position if the chief administrator of the University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire addressed this uncaring situation.",1
"Wow, so much better than Warwick hospital! It felt like it was run by professionals and the doctors and nurses and pretty much every employee there was so kind, attentive, professional and caring.

"Waited 18 months for an appointment to see an ear nose throat specialist. Sent for a ct scan, got a letter saying I needed surgery (didn’t explain what the surgery was) and booked in for a follow up appointment. That appointment has been changed 6 times and it will have been nearly a year to the date of my most recent change in appointment. No doubt it will be changed again and again. When will I actually be seen again as I can’t count on the appointments they are sending me. I cry every time I get a change of appointment.",1
Not the staffs fault...but horrendous! Been here since 7.30am (now 12:48) no beds on women ward available on day surgery! There may not be a bed and we have sat here for nothing so far and expecting a stupidly high car park fee! I work in a dental practice and if we keep pts waiting longer then 10 mins we are slaughtered! Very very fed up!,2
I can only praise the staff at the hospital and it’s the sheer support care and dedication on the cardiothoracic ward on both Saturday and Sunday with the care that they provided for my dear darling husband x Two of the colleagues especially Jodene and Lucy the night sister who were exceptional . Jodene with day care and her professionalism and dedication to my husband explaining everything and Lucy who seemed to be part of my family in every way her care for patients is totally loving caring and just pure dedication to her patients . Thankyou team from the paramedics to every one who cared looked after him I will be forever grateful x ♥️,5
"The opthalmology department are a shambles. My consultant, Mrs. Metha, is either ill or not available for my appointments, all four of them and when I arrived for one of them I was told to go home again. I am 73 years old, severely disabled barely able to walk and with other personal conditions, and having to wear a patch over the affected eye. I refused to go home so was left until last to see another consultant. Having arrived for my 2 pm appointment I finally left at 6 pm, very upset and very tired. On a subsequent appointment some weeks ago I did see a locum consultant who said I needed another CT scan.  Nothing. Last week I saw a junior doctor who told me to chase the CT with the radiology department. I did that today, only to be told no referral had been made.

This begs the question ... as Mrs. Metha is not doing her job (was she the one chatting to a friend in the waiting room last week?) but passing patients off to the junior doctors to do her job for her, is she also passing off some of her high salary to her underlings as they're doing her work??

It's a lottery in this hospital. Oncology were brilliant, Endocrinology nurses were awful, opthalmology nurses and junior doctors are on their knees while consultants are not doing their job. I'm fed up with making excuses for the ophthalmologist in particular so I won't do it any more.",1

"My daughter had an epileptic seizure in Birmingham Airport ,while waiting on her flight home,on 2nd March 2022. She was brought ,by ambulance ,to your hospital. I believe there was a very long wait to be seen, but I understand you are very busy and , I'm sure, were doing the best you could. Eventually she was given some scans ,I believe, and it was confirmed that as well as suffering one or more seizures, she had concussion which explained why she was vomiting. She was still extremely confused, which happens after a seizure, but was told she should leave.When she said she was still very confused they didn't care and left her to find her way back to the airport, alone,the time by then around1am. How can you justify sending someone, completely unfamiliar with their surroundings, confused and with confirmed concussion, out into the streets in such a manner?",1

Long waiting time for to be seen by a doctor",2
"This hospital is huge so it's quite difficult to find your way around! Make sure you know exactly which department/ward you're going to and allow time to get slightly lost.

For some reason, it's difficult to get in and out of A&E without using an outdoor staircase. You can go in through the main hospital and ask someone to take you via a lift if you are not able to safely use the stairs. I wish this were signposted.

I've had to go here for a lot of outpatient appointments and A&E visits and two minor surgeries. They've generally been very good. Some A&E visits were brilliantly quick for triage and tests; it feels very safe.

Special shout out to radiology and physiotherapy who've really gone above and beyond to help me. Thank you, you are amazing.",4

"Waited nearly 4 hrs to be seen by a nurse, but could have been in half an hour earlier if the 'calling' system was better organised. Very busy, noisy evening with two rowdy patients in the area where I was sitting and, consequently, apparently I missed my name being called the first time. Some nurses spoke clearly and loudly, but others were too soft spoken so not easy to hear. Surely there must be a better system to call in patients, they need a loudspeaker, very frustrating!! Eventually I managed to find a seat in a quieter area so then heard my name.
All staff were excellent, friendly,caring and professional and I admire the work they do in difficult circumstances. I was there for about 7 hours, but couldn't remember the exact time I arrived, expecting the machine to calculate how much I owed for parking charges, but no, I had to guess, so in order not to get a fine I had to pay the exorbitant parking fee of £9.90! Daylight robbery!! The machine was not straightforward to use and difficult to see keypad  ( which is too low) at night. If I have an appointment at this hospital I try to use public transport to avoid the high parking fees, but in an emergency this is not possible. How are these charges justifiable??",2
"This review is from my experience In July last year, I don’t know if things are any better but now my mums back in hospital so tomorrow I will call, I live in Portugal so can’t just pop down to the ward, and After many unanswered calls to the ward The only way I managed to find out how my elderly mother was doing is to make a complaint to PALS who were fantastic and went up to the ward themselves to see my mum, they helped me resolve the lack of contact with the ward , if someone would just answer the phone to let a concerned next of kin know how their family member is I wouldn’t have to keep calling, I understand the wards are busy and under staffed but 2 days of calling the ward with no answer or response after asking for a call back  is not good enough.",1

"Equality and diversity training seriously needed on HDU ward 15. It’s too upsetting to even mention what I witnessed on that ward. Absolutely shocking!

I’m glad when asked if I wanted to leave my child on the ward I didn’t. The way my child was treated whilst present was terrible and uncaring. I would hate to think what would have happened to my child had I not been present. The nurses acted like they didn’t understand that children get terrified and that they don’t understand.  Especially when they have never been in a hospital setting and the use of nebuliser and the space thing. It’s scary and foreign for any child no matter their race.

I was treated better when the discovered that I was health professional!

Those that have no clue about duty of call or do not speak English are basically treated like they’re  a nuisance.",1

Throughout the period they consistently gave incorrect information.  Just fobbed the family by stating my father's well and is resting or sleeping. When asked to help him with the TV, their response was""yes, of course will do it now"". Not once did they inform the family that the TV wasn't working! How could they allow an 87 year old on oxygen to shower on his own, only to be found collapsed in the shower? Its total neglect!",1
"We went here for an appointment this month, and came thirty minutes early, which was rather lucky, because we spent all of that time driving around looking for a car parking space. For some reason, one of the main car parks have been turned into staff parking. That's great, but where is the alternative for patients? As we meandered aimlessly around the full car parks, where many had resorted to parking illegally and dangerously due to lack of space, we honestly thought we were going to end up going home. Surely staff should be out in the car park monitoring this. This definitely needs to be sorted. This is a busy hospital that specialises in many areas, so it should be obvious that the place needs more parking spaces, and I probably don't need to mention that the charges are ridiculous. The appointment itself was great, but the experience of finding a space was nothing but stressful.",1
"So here is my latest experience of my young daughters appointment with a physiotherapist at Coventry Hospital.
As the appointment was early we left 45 minutes earlier than needed to account for Coventry rush hour traffic. Unfortunately we ran into problems on the journey with absolutely horrendous traffic.
We tried to phone the hospital to say we were running late but if you have ever tried calling the hospital then you will realize that I stood as much chance of getting through as a snowball in a deep fat fryer.
So I fought through traffic and made it to the hospital eight minutes late, I drove the car to the building I needed and told my daughter to go in and tell them what had happened while I parked the car, five minutes later she calls me and tells me the reception told her that she had missed her appointment and the next patient had been seen instead, they also refused to see her anytime during the rest of the day…
1.	We were late but how many times have I been on time for an appointment only to wait from 30 minutes to up to 4 hours , yet we never once complained, ironically the longest wait we had was down to staff stuck in traffic.
2.	The next patient just happened to be one hour early!! Really. How convenient, but if true then please go to point 3.
3.	If the next patient had gone in early then surely my daughter could have taken her time slot?
I usually stand up for the staff at Coventry Hospital but the way we were treated today is deplorable and  really is a sad indictment of the National health service.
We have no recourse with the hospital so for revenge I will not be using the hand sanitizers for any future visits :)",1
"I want to express my gratitude to the nurses, doctors and hospital staff who took such good care of my 19 year old son during his two week stay in the respiratory ward when he was ill with pneumonia. He received excellent care from a committed and caring staff. Thank you!",5
"Recently I have been bringing my very elderly father for treatment (89 and advanced cancer) and want to thank your staff who are overwhelmingly super, kind and thoughtful despite the pressure they are working under.

However, I am absolutely appalled by the parking situation and cannot believe you allow it to continue. Completely unfit for purpose.

Firstly, you are quite well aware that they isn't enough. On our most recent visit this week there were no spare parking places at all in any area, so I had to get into the queue inside the car park behind various other vehicles and we were all waiting for one person to leave so we could fight over that space, repeatedly. Can you imagine how stressful this is for a very ill patient as his appointment time got closer and closer and we were still unable to park? Eventually, I had to use the 10-minute drop-off, run in and get a wheelchair because he is unable to walk and leave him alone, while I tried to park once again. I had to leave my poor father alone for more than half an hour. His sight is poor and he was very anxious.

Additionally, the parking payment machines never work correctly, or perhaps the ANPR as the car number plate is never recognised so you have to guess how long you have been parking in order to decide how much money to pay. Also they do not give change and only allow to pay by cash. This is completely unacceptable. I did not have correct change and was forced to pay even more than my ridiculous parking charge.

My dad is very very worried about his next appointment that we will be in the same situation. We were suggested to get a taxi instead, but live far in Warwickshire and it would cost more than £60. One of the staff suggedted parking at Tesco and walking! Obviously that is not an option for a frail gentleman and anyway Tesco only allow short stays for their customers of course. The appalling parking situation must be fixed urgently because it detracts from what is otherwise a potentially wonderful community and university hospital.",3
Big 5☆ to all the staff that helped me after my heart attack the paramedics the A&E team Dr Bean and his team that did my operation also ward 11 coronary care nurses were amazing nothing was too much trouble for them then met the Doctor he was awesome explained everything to me and what I should next then I agreed to have rehabilitation and stop smoking the staff were amazing too the ward was spotlessly clean I will never see these people again just want to say a big big thank you for saving my life,5

When l arrived today l was seen promptly. Everyone from the reception to the Consultant were very kind and helpful going the extra mile to explain and reassure. The NHS is wonderful.
My only complaint is the availability of parking. It took 45 minutes to find a parking space which was very stressful. A multi-storey car park is needed urgently.",5
Nurses and the hospitality it's more than I expected. Sometimes its very busy if you're going to the a&e and the waiting time can be more than 3 4h.

"Has anyone had unpleasant/ undesirable experience with the Urology and Pain Management department?

For some reason they have not been able to give me a proper diagnosis since December last year! As a result, I've been enduring my pain daily for over 6 months now severely affecting the quality of my social, work and family life. In essence, living a reduced quality of life sadly!

Also, I've since had somewhat invasive procedures causing  pain, discomfort and I'm worried about potential complications. Why would it take them so long to diagnose, treat and cure? I've felt lack of compassion and care for human suffering; physical and mental.

Frankly, I'm starting to loose confidence in their ability and experience to help solve my problems. It's difficult to cope well if I'm hopeless. In fact, it's not fair on anyone to live in constant pain and fear. I'm going to contact PALS to investigate but thought I'd share publicly to see if this resonates with them.

Update - I was seen by the Pain Management in August and have been awaiting treatment since. The consultant has failed to offer a plan to manage/ mitigate daily pain adversely affecting the quality of my day-to-day life.

It is unacceptable and inhumane of NHS to leave their patients suffer and not empower them to take control of their daily pain or treat them in a timely manner. Another awfully distressing experience!

If this experience is relatable please hit the thumbs up and help make an impact, thanks in advance!",1
"Appalling treatment the place is unsafe & a majority of the staff can’t be bothered. Dr’s are down right rude, if the cause of your problem can’t be easily diagnosed then you are making it up !!! (To get attention, what attention).

I went in with sepsis a temp of 39.4 ….. 18 hours on a trolley & 32 attempts to cannulate me (my fault my veins are small)
Waited 3 days nil by mouth for surgery on day 3 the nurse said I needed to drink something as my BP was low, 10 minutes later they came to take me to theatre!!! But I’d had a drink ! I discharged myself still needing surgery but I was to scared to stay.

"On Wednesday 8th September, I was refered to A&E, by NHS 111, with a head injury, following a collision in my car. I had severe head and neck pain, nausea and vomitting, blurred vision and intermitant ringing in my left ear. I had driven from Rugby to Walsgrave. On arrival at the department, there was a blue sign stating that 111 referals had to be seen within thirty minutes, but I was informed that  was not at all possible, and so why have the sign on display then??

The information board was showing a waiting time for triage at 90 minutes. After having waited for nearly four hours though  I was then told there were still five people in front of me, and there would then be a waiting time of eight to ten hours to see a doctor. I explained as to how my symptons were worsening and especially my eyesight, and I was becoming very anxious about not being able to drive home if I waited much longer.

I then had no choice but to leave the department, whilst I could still see well enough to drive. I had a few minor bumps on the way home, but this has got to be the NHS at it's absolute worst, when arriving at the department with a potentially serious condition.

I am now trapped at home, with my symptons still the same. My GP won't see me, I can't access the urgent treatment centre at St Cross, as they only deal with minor injuries and conditions, and won't see me either. I have a potentially serious injury, but have not been able to access any treatment from the NHS. It feels like we are now in a third world country with our healthcare  and that a great many lives are going to be needlessly lost, and that there is not even any point in going to A&E, even if your injury/illness is potentially serious.",1

It was not my normal pain that I have been living with for 15 years but new pain and they hadn't even seen the scan results before writing discharge summary. This would not be my first bad experience of walsgrave hospital either. The nursing staff are on the whole a nice and friendly bunch who are hard working but the system there is beyond broken and the drs making decisions are doing so without taking actual patients into consideration. I would not recommend and I do not feel safe there nor do I trust that I have been treated properly there.",1
"My husband was discharged at midnight, and was brought home by ambulance, arriving home at 00.30 am. The following day he received a message telling him he had tested positive for Covid-19.  He had been there a week with respiratory problems, and had been tested every other day, without a positive result. They couldn't get him out of there quick enough.
Their barrier nursing obviously leaves a lot to be desired.",1
"Called for an ambulance for severe sharp chest pain, fast heart beat and not been able to breath we were told they can't come and to make our own way.I was shocked at the way I was left to feel.this needs to be looked in to as it sounds like a lot of people are not receiving the emergency help needed.would you rather we die instead ? Than to turn up and save someone's life??",1
"People will always be quick to complain about poor service, it's nice to see that there are some good comments on here too.  The general public are so unforgiving.

As with all businesses, there are good staff and not so good staff.  There are good departments and not so good departments, the reasons for which you will not know unless you work there.  The staff work very hard, they are mostly polite and personable.  I have spent a lot of time at this hospital over many years since it opened.  Sometimes my experiences are good, sometimes not so good.  Luck of the draw I guess.  The worst clinics I have ever attended are the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and the Ante Natal Clinics (Ultrasound included).  The waiting times are simply ridiculous in both areas.  The Ante Natal has put me off to the point of not having any further children which I shouldn't really have to be a part of considering!

The hospital is clean, the facilities inside are decent.  They do need to sort out the parking situation and the pay and display car park, which I always end up under or overpaying for, usually with some distress when underpaying as you dread getting back to your car with a ticket on it because your paid time has expired.  The other major item is the smoking.  Smoking around the entrances is disgusting and seeing pregnant women or people smoking around their sick children is disgusting.  The hospital just need to acknowledge that despite their policies, people are going to smoke.  They need to provide some 'bus stop' type shelters far enough away from the entrances for these people to smoke out of the way and for those of us that don't smoke, to not have to put up with their passive fumes.",4
"Very Disappointed!!! I attended an appointment this week and didn't realize I had left my mobile phone at home upon arriving at the hospital. I was dropped off and had no form of communication to arrange my pick up.

I approached 2 members of staff (the consultant I was seeing, the front desk receptionist), to ask if I was able to use a phone after explaining my situation, both saying 'No"", but i can use a public phone within the hospital.

I then spoke to a very helpful gentleman who told me where the only ONE payphone was in the hospital, which DID NOT WORK!! (By now my emotions and anxiety levels were very high). I went back to the gentleman, who told me to speak to the receptionist at the blood test clinic. I again asked the third member of staff for help, she told me she could not let me use the phone due to Covid and me touching the handset. I then asked if I could tell her the number and she could dial and speak to my husband for me. Her response was, 'No regardless, I can't let you use the phone'.

Absolutely disgusting behavior by all members I had approached. None had felt they had a duty of care or empathy!

If this was an elderly, none ethnic minority would the response been any different. Lack of common sense by far!!! Why are we praising NHS staff when they treat you like this?

Luckily for me a kind baptised Sikh couple were kind enough to call my husband and let me use their phone. Shame it wasn't the NHS staff we were clapping for!!!",1
"Always come across very polite staff.
Yes waiting time could be long , because people coming into hospital with silly things,  rather then visit a GP.

Thanks to every staff member.",5
Went there yesterday. With temperature 40. Was sitting on the floor 6hrs next to the exit. No space. People smoking so much. Couldn't brith. Nurse said she can't unforse them. Floor was so derty. This is Hospital. Why are you let people smoke in A&E?,1
"My partner and I were treated awfully at Walsgrave university hospital. I was shouted at by a member of staff due to asking for my X-ray results -as I had a suspected broken ankle- 4 hours after the scan.
I had been told by a nurse as soon as the scan had finished it would take an 1-2 hours for the results to come back. So I wait, if course.
Meanwhile my partner was standing outside in the cold waiting for me -due to covid- so I decided to ring my nurse bell 3 hours into waiting so I could have a rough idea of when I'd be leaving. I was ringing it for about an hour with no outcome so I call my partner on the phone to ask for me downstairs.
Soon after a nurse barged into the room I was in and proceeded to shout at me saying ""your partner keeps bothering the staff asking when you'll be getting your X-ray results, you do know you're not a priority now!? I have someone downstairs with a stab wound to the head!!"" Pointing at me. I reply ""I am sorry, I don't mean to disrespect you or your job but I've been calling my nurses bell for over an hour now with no responses so I asked my partner to help. I am in extreme pain and I would like to just know when my results will be here so I can go home with my partner who is freezing outside waiting for me"". She continued to shout at me calling me 'entitled' until I asked her ""please stop disrespecting me, I will go home now"" to which she replied ""whatever!"" storming past the nurses watching on in the hallway (whome may I say never came in to comfort me). Soon after she left I had a massive panic attack and I asked to leave with a pair of crutches.
I understand the pressure of the job and do nothing but respect and thank the staff when I have stayed but I can truly say I have never been so mistreated in a hospital before. To put a situation such as someone’s head injury on me is totally unprofessional and unfair when all I’m asking for is HELP.",1
"One of those 'if I could give zero stars I would'.  Incredibly overpriced yet still incredibly hard to find space hence they can rip people off.  Also car park is old, terrible and Tiny even for small ish cars meaning anything bigger parks badly which has a knock on effect.  The hospital car park has a reputation for a reason.",1
"I have had several procedures at university hospital and St Cross the care  I have received has been compassionate, caring and effective.  At no time did I feel that I was not included in decisions and consulted at all times.",5
"Appalling service by health care staff Georgine i presume. Present date(01/07/2021) in ward 23, one of the health care staff is extremely rude, the other nurses are pleasant at all times while i couldn't catch the name of this one particular one properly (think her name was Georgine), she was extremely uncompassionate and rough handling with whatever she does. Always seems to deny closing the curtains for patients for some privacy even if the patients have a catheter insertion. She seems to make an easy COVID test as rough and uncomforting as she possibly could. Patient was too fragile and in no condition to feed herself after a surgery, so she asked a student nurse to feed her, which she did but the other nurse(Georgine) refused and stopped the student nurse from feeding her and told the patient to eat the food herself while it was clearly visible she couldn't. Even when its late at night past 10pm this particular nurse would continue to be loud and inconsiderate about the patients. other patients are having to take care of each other in the ward all because of nurses like this unable to provide patients adequate needs.
personally a health care worker like this is not fit to be a nurse. No one wants an unpleasant visit every time with nurses like this in the ward while a patients not in their best condition. If health care staffs like this are unhappy doing a job like this they shouldn't be in this sector.
It makes the patient's family members and friends feel aggrieved too and feeling like some of the nurses in the hospital are discomforting the patient. Not the first time, the patient has experienced continuous miserable service from this health care staff and not just this particular patient but most of them in the ward. The student nurses seem to be doing a much better job with patient care. Hoping there will be something done about this matter. This place probably just needs to appoint better staff overall with better mannerism to aid patients.",1
"Had an accident while working at Tesco (December 2017)  which resulted in me being taken to A&E (@02:30). Had to wait about 30 minutes before seeing a doctor which isn't bad to be honest. Told me I had to have surgery on my eye to fix the damage.

Worst part of my visit was waiting around for a bed. Feels terrible when you're waiting while in considerable pain and not knowing what's going on. Finally got a bed @13:00 and the operation was @15:00.

The parking is an absolute joke though. 10 minutes free parking and the prices from then on are just laughable to be honest. If you want to go there during the day then the traffic is HORRENDOUS, they really need to fix this because it is just not sustainable. Best to get dropped off outside hospital grounds and walk from there or get a bus it's that bad.

I thought the doctors and nurses were great. Took great care of me while I was recovering. NHS staff really do not get enough praise, they really are some of the best people in the world. Words don't do them justice. Amazing people.

There were times when I got frustrated about the time spent waiting but there are A LOT of people that need care and only so many doctors. I am very grateful to the staff here.",5
"Shocking care of the elderly  these doctors were only interested  if i had a do not resuscitate  in place for my father.  My dad went in and never left he died as they were discharging him. I strongly believe it was down to the fact that staff were not watching his blood pressure, because  he had a massive bleed on his brain and died in minutes.  If you have elderly family I would watch them very carefully as the doctors see them as bed blockers !!!  I strongly think my dad died due to not being looked after properly because he was bed blocking and he was elderly . I hate this hospital and god help us all if we live to a good age and we have to attend this place !!!!",1
"Staff are rude, abusive & judgemental towards people with mental & physical health conditions who don’t have a clue what it’s like on a daily basis to try & cope. They also show no empathy or care for there jobs, some of them do. You’re kept here waiting for hours without any food or water in claustrophobic rooms. At one point I kept asking several times because my hands were shaking as I hadn’t eaten & had any fluids. The spiteful nurse just looked at me & had a go at me when I kindly asked for water. This is also dirty & smelly hospital with marks all over the walls. I must have gagged several times, they don’t use any air fresheners. I don’t know when this place was last decorated but it really is a shambles. I can understand why people end up kicking off, because they are pushed to breaking point. I love the NHS but this hospital is a bloody disgrace, absolutely shameful!",1
"I attended the gynocology a and e here last year with bleeding during pregnancy, I only waited about 10 minutes to be seen, I was scanned straight away where it was confirmed my babies heart had stopped and I was having yet again another miscarriage. I was admitted to the ward and treated with respect and dignity all the time I was there. Nurses and HCA's went out their way to offer the best care, offer advice and even comfort me through my heartache. A fantastic hospital and fantastic staff can't thank you all enough.",5
"I hope I never get admitted here like my poor dead Mum. She had an accident, after spending 6.5 hours in A/E we ended up in 3 different wards. The wards were very dirty, the bed linen we left on a shelve fully open to the world. My mother was placed in the corridor on a chair next to another lady who was forcibly held down whilst given medication. Then had her nightie held up so everyone could see all her private parts.",1
"The surgical team and day staff were excellent. Night shift, not so good. I had to ask if I was going back on a monitor after being on a monitor for 3 days and being transferred from George Elliot to Coventry on a monitor to be told it wasn't in my notes and they would have to order one and it wouldn't arrive till the morning. I was in ccu after suffering a heart attack. Surely they should be available on a heart unit.",3
"The hospital is very good. The reason for the 2 star review is the car park company who even when presented with evidence of correct payment still continue to try and charge £100 fine for parking. Car Parking Partnership is a blight on this hospital and its patients. There are so many complaints regarding this parking company. Awful, shameful behaviour.",2
"I visited the hospital as advised by my GP for further investigation. I was first sent to MDU, which staff directed me to the DVT department. They called the unit and made them aware that I was on my way over. The nurses on DVT were wonderful. They dealt with me swiftly, took my medical details, bloods, arranged a scan for the same day. I was made to feel comfortable, relaxed and well cared for. Thank you all for your wonderful support on 5/11/2021.",5
My brother has been in for day surgery and Got told nil by mouth from 2am and was in 8am for surgery. By 8pm still hasn’t been down for surgery due to an emergency fair enough. At 11:30pm was told he could have food and eat till 2am which he was given a menu to look at while he ate a sandwich then gets told after he ordered something hot and filling after not eating for 24 hours that they are not doing hot food. So he was just left with a sandwich!!!  And to top it off he asked for a pillow to be able to get some sleep and they claim they don’t have any pillows available to give him so he’s having to use his jumper which he’s rolled up.  I’m in discomfort and finds it hard to sleep as it is now he’s being left without a pillow.  Absolute joke it really is. Not happy at all he’s 19 and has been there all alone because of covid restrictions and he’s had to deal with all this on his own for his first ever surgery.  I wouldn’t want to go back there again for anything after that experience!!,1
"Went to see ENT via A&E. Friday afternoon. Easy to park, reception ladies firm but polite. Saw a nurse within first hour who confirmed my illness. Went for a blood test then saw the first ENT doctor Chris, lovely polite and caring. Was honest it would hurt when he examined me as very swollen ear. He sorted me pain relief and the right medication.  Staff changeover at 8pm meant I saw a second gentleman who was equally as nice, clear and polite. He advised me he was taking over looking after me and after 6 hours I was able to go home with an outpatient appointment for Monday morning. Very impressed; nurses and all other staff lovely and kind especially the two who helped me walk when I couldn’t stand up due to being dizzy. The place was immaculate and clean. Thank you to a wonderful hospital.",5
"Attending here under the care of Prof Quenby and the research team in Gynae. The staff are all so friendly and experienced, my referral went through super quickly and efficiently.
It’s easy to get through to the admin and clinical team for queries, appointment times are punctual, the hospital entrance is lovely and bright, with lots of options for refreshments. Although it’s a large hospital, it’s well signposted and I found it easy to navigate from the entrance.
I work in a different trust and their hospitals are significantly below the standard of this one.
The only issue I encountered was the long waiting time at the pharmacy but that’s to be expected.

Couldn’t ask for more, 5 ⭐️",5
"The phone no. doesn't work (really!) and from the grammar and puctuation, their letters appear to have been written by a toddler.",1
"It is the worst hospital ever. Rushed in and diagnosed with diabetes and infection because of diabetes. Four days later kicked out ward by senior nurse. Still with high blood sugars and infection, Not bothered need beds,

doctors have prescribed me some medication not sure it will work leave it up to GP to figure that out. Had to wait 5 hours in discharge lounge for my medication, feeling very ill, blood  sugars tested they were up around 16, Senior nurse came in and said nothing can do doctors given my tablets and that’s it.

The nurses were nice and helpful on the ward. They were in the discharge lounge up to a point were after 5 hours of having high blood sugar and being ill. I was not allowed to go home  because the medication I was waiting for was diabetic meds. But they were happy to just kick me off the ward. Finally got my medication and had to walk to a taxi.",1
So I have no words to express my opinion as incompetent and frivolous in his field.  Wait at least 6-7 hours for a paracetamol and a stupid consultation.  That means coming to the emergency room for first aid.  You can die waiting.,1
"I've never seen a hospital car park so appaling. Traveled with my wife for an appointment, nowhere to  park, all the car parks where full and so much illegal parking that just blocks entrances. After 30 minutes we couldn't find a space, drove out and parked in asda and walked. What a joke.",1
I had my delivery at this hospital one month ago.The caring of midwives are beyond praise. The staff were extremely good. Doctors provided enough and timely information to enable us for taking an informed decision. Facilities are very good. I stayed there for a week and did not have any problem.,5
There is no less than one star who had a very cruel experience during my birth to my child in the hospital. I was completely neglected and afraid of even the name of the hospital. I do not advise any pregnant woman to go there.,1
"Car Parking Experience Not Great

This is a brief review of the parking at the hospital and NOT the hospital itself or the brilliant NHS staff.

CAR PARKING

If you're visiting here for the first time, be aware that - like many NHS hospitals - parking can be a real challenge.

At busy times (evening visiting hours for example) the car parks can be full and quite chaotic. I've had several visits where I've gone around and around the car park(s) trying to find a spot.

No surprises I guess but make sure you add in that extra time when visiting at these peak hours.

At other times of the day, it's not been too bad. However, because the hospital is so big the car parks can be quite far from where you've got to get to. So, allow extra time for parking if you have an appointment to make.

Final comment, they've moved to one of the newer 'Automatic Number Plate Recognition' or ANPR payment systems.

Which means cameras will  take a photo of your car as you enter the car park. You will then need to find one of the payment machines (which are blue and under plastic bus-shelter areas) and search for your car using the on-screen keypad.

When these systems were first installed, I didn't realise what had changed (I'm pretty stupid) and thought that the barriers were up because they were broken.

I drove away after my appointment, happy in the knowledge I'd not paid for an NHS visit - which I resent anyway - only to be stung by a fine in the post. Make sure, therefore, you pay before you exit :-))",3
"I went to have an echocardiogram today in out patients, clinic 7. They lady that gave me the echocardiogram was the most polite and caring person. (I'm sorry I didn't get her name but I know she was starting a new job soon). I just wanted to say thank you for making me feel very comfortable and talking to me through the whole process. I felt she was listening to what I was saying and she took her time. Thank you once again. Hope you enjoy your new job.",5
"Had to attend an appointment with my wife for 11.30 Tuesday morning. We arrived in the carpark about 11 and made our way to clinic 6 in out patients which is a fair walk. We arrived there about 11.20 and checked in. We weren't called until nearly 12.30. At no time were we advised of any delay or offered an apology.
Then to add insult to injury  the car park  charge  was £3.90. Absolutely disgraceful. You get 3 hours  at St. Cross  for £1.70. I have to add that the staff were friendly.",2
"Hello, Excellent well organised hospitaI. I was in the coronary care unit for three days after they called out an emergency team at 22:00. Nothing was too much trouble for the dedicated, caring and attentive staff. From consultants to tea ladies i was treated with courtesy and respect. They explained in detail what they were doing and answered any questions, all with a sense of humour. Particular thanks to Sophie and Debbie.",5
"The service at the hospital are second to none, but they have some serious issues that they are failing to solve. Lack of car parking is a big problem also if you have someone who is in a wheelchair and you don't have a blue badge, then you have big problems as they won't let you park in the disabled parking area. If I had to choose an hospital for my care, then I'm sorry to say I would have to go elsewhere which is a shame as the treatment is good. Also this is supposed to be a no smoking area but everyone ignores this and chugs away in the  foyer as you walk into the hospital. So if you have breathing issues this will make you worse. There are plenty of buses and taxis.",1
Great hospital what lets it down is parking. Hospital car parking is a rip off. The pay machines are faulty and you pay for parking then they don't take money even though the machine states £2 payment accepted then they send threatening letters demanding £60 fine and if not payed within 7days it will cost double. When you tell them this and to request CCTV footage from hospital they say no pay up.,3
"Don't even bother going to the hospital here.
You will literally die waiting to be seen.",1
"First time ever having visited but have to say I am not impressed.  Have reason to be at Minor Injuries Unit - very few staff with massive wait and those on duty seem to spend more time chatting than trying to clear the ""queue"".  No update or ""we are sorry"".  Very poor service and sarcastic nurse doesn't doesn't help especially when people are in pain.  Courtesy costs nothing!",1
The nurse they didn't pay attention to our symptom description. Also no respect. My wife was very drowsy and can't focus. But the nurse was very rude and told my wife ' I'm talking to you to confirm your date of birth it is very rude'   that time I was going to argue with her but I controlled myself as my wife is the most important person to look after,1
"I wanted to visited my elderly father at the hospital but was turned away! I pleaded with the ward manager and explained my reasons. In the end, I left the ward with my head down & felt sadness ...😥

Denying a son to visiting his elderly father doesn't seem right.  There is attitude  & lack of empathy at the ward. A simple health update would have put my mind at rest. Come UHCW you can do better than this. Appreciate these are difficult times for all 🙏",2
It is absolutely ridiculous how long the wait is in childrens A&E. They need more doctors on as you have children sat for hours and hours. The times just keep getting extended due to emergencies which I totally understand but if there were more doctors on especially at night the hours waiting would reduce to more copable times.,2
"My family and I would like to send our heartfelt thanks the staff on area 2 of the Head and Neck Department for their treatment and care of my husand, John, who was admitted on Tuesday 23rd June after having an accident with a grinder.  He said all the staff were extremely proficient, friendly and caring, and nothing was too much trouble for them. Thank you so much for taking such good care of him.",5
"On Friday 2nd July 2021
I was admitted to the day surgery unit to have my gall bladder removed and I would like to say a big thank you to all the nursing staff for looking after me so well,you all deserve a medal for putting up with me  lol, I can't thank you enough, you all definitely deserve a massive pay rise.
My one and only criticism is the food horrible the fish I had was a poor excuse for fish surely the powers that be must know about the state of the food just look at all the wastage and perhaps review the menu available and give us some decent food,less waste.
Thanks again for looking after me

"I would rate it 0+5 if I could.

5 for the care you get majority of the time when you actually see medical staff.

0 for pretty much everything else. Parking is universally horrific including at maternity ward!!! Also my post natal ward experience was traumatising to a point I refuse to have another baby here. Not to mention min 30mins (or even 3hrs) wait for nearly every appointment.

I know ultimately it's a medical facility, but I just can't fathom how they can suffer from such basic issues as e.g. parking so many many many years in a row without any sort of improvement.

I am so glad George Elliott maternity ward is time-wise similar distance to us. It was a no brainer to switch for my second baby.",2
"I went to the Children's a&e today. Such a bad experience, nothing but hassle for my sick baby. I asked the nurses to take my son's temperature as he was too hot. They asked me to wait and completely ignored me. They finally took his temperature one hour later and my poor baby has been having a 39,6°C all this time. After waiting 5 hours I took the decision to go home and get my 9-month-old seen from a gp in the morning. When I told them I was leaving, they looked for his papers and they were totally misplaced. He wasn't even considered to be seen. It looks like you can only be seen if your child is dying. The only thing you accomplish is to pay a fortune for the car park, the snacks and the gas to get there. Worriedly asking the NHS: do you have any idea how children's health is deteriorating when they stay in the hospital's waiting room for hours to get seen by a doctor?",1
"I was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis, the wait in A and E was incredibly long and painful. Once I was finally seen all the hospital staff were lovely bar one nurse, that would see how much pain I was in and was doing nothing to get me additional pain relief! However after coming in at around the 10:30pm I was finally admitted at 4am, around 8am I was moved to a ward and told I may need to undergo scans. I was visited by a number of doctors who made the quick decision to take me straight in which I was pleased with! Later that day around 6pm I underwent, cystecotmy and had my ovary untwisted! The doctors were fantastic, their fast decision making has saved my ability to have children in the future and I couldn't be more thankful! All the nurses were lovely, reassuring me every step of the way!",4
Worst hospital ever. Un-necessary faffing about. No-one actually bothers to tell you anything. Things done to me without warning or consent. You're far better off just hoping for the best than coming to this circus.,1
Hello strangers my name is Justin if you remember me I want to come back to ae department am I allowed I need help like before no good people putting this hospital down on comments not nice peeps I say it's the best hospital in the Midlands and I mean that there nice people who works here who I seen helped me with everything I want in my life can't wait for my favourite bit of this hospital eventually but it will be years yet my darlings,5
"I was at this hospital in the summer after breaking my back in a car accident, I was in hospital for 11 days on ward 43, I didn't have the best experience, being on flat bed rest..everytime they gave me my meal, I could never reach the table or they would put my meal at the far corner of the table, I couldn't cut my food and I didn't get help with someone assisting me with my meal, only when my family was in, I was in a room of 4, the carers or nurses never brushed my teeth, even when I ask as they said they was too busy...don't get me wrong some of the nurses/carers were brilliant!! But They didn't wash my hair...sometimes I wouldn't have a wash until 3pm..when my family came in they would have to help me, some of the meals i ordered came to me completely diffrent to what I ordered, I would tell a member of staff that I didn't order what they gave me and they would say I have ordered it...but when they went and checked, they saw I was right, and that i didn't order what they gave me, made me feel like I was incompetent. Some days I would only get rolled twice a day, sometimes it would only be once at that time my back was very uncomfortable and becoming sore as I couldn't move myself so I would just have to lie there, when I buzzed my bell I would have to wait 30mins to a hour for them to respond. The night staff at the hospital on the ward I was on was horrible...some was nice and others were just so rude to you and none of them cared about their job...they would be gossiping and I could hear everything they was saying...after my back fusion, I was supposed to have a 6 week check up and it's been 5 months later I haven't seen anyone about my back...i had 4 months off work as I was suffering from alot of back pain, I am still suffering from back pain in my right side after 5 months, I don't really know what they done to my back as no one came and spoke to me about the operation i had just had...I had been to my doctors 4 Times and told them I need to see someone about my back.. I had emailed the surgeon that done my back surgery and I had called his receptionist and finally after 5 months I will be seeing someone about my back!  This hospital seems to give you treatment and then just leave you in the dark even after major surgeries...hopefully after all of this I will not ever have to come back! And I feel very sorry for the people who are in their care!!",2
"Make sure you pay any car parking tickets while you’re at the hospital with using chip and pin. Don’t use cash, don’t use contactless. The fine is £100 regardless. They say they’ll take into consideration of any illnesses but they lie. It doesn’t matter if you’re severely disabled of if they have technical malfunctions in your appeal.",1
"Arrived 30 minutes early but spent one hour and ten minutes trying to find a parking space. The staff may be amazing but the parking is atrocious. I have never felt so awful whilst trying to park the car and then to be charged 3 pounds for a 5 minute park. Wow.
I will ask for Rugby St Cross hospital from now on. Lovely place!!",1
"Absolutely disgusting Hospital in ALL ASPECTS. I had an appointment at 2:10pm and turned right from Clifford Bridge Road into the Hospital grounds at 1:30pm. I was then stuck in a traffic jam. You would think that allowing 40 minutes from that point, would be ample time. Think again! I was stuck in a traffic jam for over 45 minutes. After finally finding parking and walking to the department I needed to get to, I was very rudely told that I could not be seen to, as I missed my appointment. What makes it worse, is that the NHS sends texts messages saying that missed appointments cost the NHS £160. Now, this money should be billed to the idiot responsible for designing the layout of the Hospital. There is only one road going in and one road going out. After paying over 35 years of tax in this country, this is the kind of service that's being given by the NHS. The corrupt councillors and MP of Coventry don't care, as I have already tried to communicate with them.",1
Waiting time over 12 hours ! They act inuman ! I was very sick and nobody seems to care about it ! After 12 hours a doctor saw me and give me paracetamol and send me home without solving anything ! With those kind of people is just better to stay in your bad and waiting to die ! One star is too much for this s…t hospital !,1
"I waited for my appointment nearly 45 days after arrived well in advance  30mins in eye clinics for my eye injection for the eye blood clot.Checked in an appointment after the eye drops and triage checkup I was waiting  for another 1 hour then doctor  coming and telling me there was no nurse to help me to do injection and he said to reschedule another appointment  and send back 2 old people and me. After arrange my days off and taxi to reach hospital  because of not to drive with eye drops. I literally asked 3 doctors and nurses to help my doctor  to assist and finish mine but no one come forward. Very worst experience and been to this hospital for several times for mine and wife chronic  disease.  Distrustful service.
Rugby st. Cross is excellent  in many ways.",1
I was supported and cared for by staff while I was waiting to see the specialist for my mental health. They were amazing and very caring and stabilised me really seems as they did not know and being someone I has trust issues but prefers females they were excellent. However I can see knowing myself and being aware that I prefer means that I did lots of the hard work myself.,5
"The Nurse were Rude!!!
Shouted at my late father . Never gave him Proper care  and ignore him!! No there no their Families  can't see them they treat the patients Badly!!! Disgusting behaviour  from the nurse and the Dr!!!
My respect  has gone out the Window for them!!! Sorry I won't be Clapping  for the NHS!!",1
My husband is very seriously ill.  He needs rest but his nights are continually disturbed by another patient turning his TV on loud.  This can be 12.30 at night or 4.30 in the morning.  He will fall asleep watching it.  There seems to be no control over how loud or when TVs can be on and there should be.,2
"don't expect too much from the hospital (emergency births) last night10.03.2022 at 20:00 I arrived at the hospital with an ambulance (university hispital coventry) for a medical emergency a pregnancy outside the uterus where I was treated well only by the nurses from The woman was taken to a salon and was offered a coverall and waited for the doctor. In two hours, the doctor appears. not to eat anything just to consume water so that in the morning she is ready for the operation, 24 hours have passed since she did not eat, she feels weak, headaches, stomach pain support from the nurses only a glass of water and they still have said it takes half an hour, in 3-4 hours it takes an hour, a total of 24 hours this lie means urgent to the hospital where the equipment is state of the art but doctors and nurses are there only for money, thanks NHS p for nothing do you pay with public money.",1
Had a job interview here and arrived 45 minutes early to give myself time to park. There was no car parking at all. I was driving round for over 40 minutes to no avail and the phone number I was given was disconnected. The general switchboard number wouldn't pick up either. DO NOT DRIVE HERE. YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PARK.,1
"I ended up on ward 43 after being brought in, in an emergancy after having an episode with my epilepsy, all I can say is that all the Dr's, Nurses and Consultants gave their upmost care, especially during the times of the Pandemic. They were so positive, chatty and at the same time ensuring they gave you 100% of their care and dedication sharing their time equally between each patient as and when needed on the ward. Thank you so much for all your help Simon",5
"Easy to get to, well directed on roads. So easy to find your way around even though the hospital is so big. Always someone willing to give you help if you feel lost. Consultants in fracture clinic so thorough and friendly and explain everything in a way that's easy to understand- not in scientific terms. Recommend to anyone who needs treatment",5
"Attended for an upper GI Endoscopy today, and I cannot praise the staff more highly. I was very anxious, and had read too many horror stories on the internet so was dreading it. But there was the most amazing team waiting for me, Diana the Endoscopist, nurses Jayde and Monika, and I’m sorry I don’t know the name of the fourth member of the team, but she was wonderful. They were reassuring through it, held my hands, completely understanding. And I had the procedure with just the throat spray, no sedation. I can honestly say, it was painless, I just concentrated on my breathing. It can cause the burps, & I ended up giggling every time it happened lol. Thank you everyone!",5
"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I have been suffering from vertigo for a month, I can’t do daily tasks, I can’t do work, I can’t study, hence I can’t support myself. I have been told my ear pain is related to stress, without no further examination. When my ear clearly has muffled hearing and has been having liquidy residue. If I lose hearing, will it also be related to stress as well? If I fall from vertigo and hit my head, will it also be stress related? I have not been dismissed in my life so badly, two days in a row. If I lose my hearing, who is going to be responsible, when I seeked for help few times already??? It will be your incompetent staff.",1
"2, than 5, than extra 4 hours of just in que waiting. In that time, a return flight and proper hospital treatment can be organised in a civilised country. Still waiting, BTW!
Have been told to try tomorrow (after all this time, but it can take another day in a que to get any diagnosis and help ( no it is not an open heart operation I am waiting for, a simple hand injury treatment! Sorry- waiting diagnosis first). So, still waiting (naps not allowed, painkillers after diagnosis hopefully). Cannot recollect a missed or late national insurance deduction from my salary. Though, such a slow work from nhs is fine. Still waiting... joined the que in a daytime, perhaps would be able to see a sunrise (if not inside the building). Total disrespect to another human being. Shameful. Shameful standard- every day here seems to be similar. Support nhs they say... totally worth it.

Update (day after):
Please bear in mind it is not a script for Mr. Bean.
After waiting to see the rheumatologist from 3pm, at midnight,  they have realised, the doctor is already at home (before 8pm at least) . Awesome professionalism and management.
Jokes about treatment with paracetamol only are not true- I've got ibuprofen prescribed (yes another over - counter painkiller... fun fact pharmacyopens at 8am... it's just extra 7hrs.. or another site visitin the morning... tempting :) ) .
At 1 am I was sent home.  Perhaps in 2 weeks it can be arranged to meet a doctor.  In a meantime I do not know why my hand is swelling like crazy and hurts. Blood test taken turned up to be irrelevant- standard procedure,  that was not useful to my case at all. I've been told, I qualify for 24h observation in hospital,  but need to see the rheumatologist first. 2 extra weeks of waiting,  pain and stressful uncertainty. But nobody cares. 💘 the professionalism and humanistic approach. No need to hurry- I am only a human.",1
"The car park was full and I was really lucky to find a space, the ticket machine was broken (coin payments only).

The waiting is horrible but you have to expect that at A&E.

There was little information, I had no idea where to sit and worried about missing my name being called but all of this was made up for by the lovely staff who were all so caring.

The cherry on top was a member of staff (who I doubt I will ever see again )giving me £2 as I didn't have enough cash for my car park ticket",5
"Just been discharged from neurological wards at hospital. Wonderful care and support from all the staff on these 2 wards. So hard working and professional.Thank you all.
Also everyone inI ICU and the doctors involved in my treatment.",5
"What do you say about a group of people that saved your life, they were overwhelmingly  brilliant. Once they found out the type of cancer I had they were on it like a rash, every nurse and doctor answered every question without hesitation and showed great confidence, an inspiration to any patient in my position, on the point of throwing in the towel.",5
Waited for nearly 5 hours and my 2 year old son was not seen no choice but to go private from now on NHS im sorry but your a failure to me and my family multiple times.,1
"I had my baby here back in September and although after my son was born.. they were brilliant, before my son was born I was treated awful! I came in with my waters broke and they were also checking me for a blood clot in my lung and all sorts of things.. without even knowing the results, they xame into my room at 1am and told me i needed to wait in the waiting room as they needed the bed?! It was 1am in the morning and I was in agony.. I was disgusted with this and so were my family! But when my son was finally here after 2 and half weeks of me being in hospital before hand, they were brilliant! Just a shame they treated me so rubbish whilst he was inside of me!",3
"On Saturday the 30th of march I had a gastric sleeve surgery and from the moment I arrived at the S.O.D.A.ward I felt welcomed , the staff were considerate and made you aware of what was occurring . Went into theater and again all was explained to me. Aftercare was second to none . I would like to give a big shout out to all the staff that helped me for their kindness and patience especially those on s.o.d.a., theatre, recovery, ward 22 E.C.U., Ward 31 and dispatch lounge. Last but by no means least a big thank you to the porters and cleaners  without who the hospital couldn't run  Once again a massive thanks to everyone",5
"10 months waiting for surgery.
5 hours waiting on a freezing cold ward.
Overheard staff saying they were disciplined for wearing a cardigan.
Maybe a coat would have been better.

5 hours prepared and waiting.
Operation cancelled.
Days pay lost.
Tumour still waiting to be removed and biopsied.

Maybe next year?
The year after?

Or is it cheaper to wait and see?

Jeremy Hunt,  are your children proud of the NHS you leave behind?",1
"The staff are so lovely and comforting they are all brilliant! Everywhere is clean, the food i cant comment as have not eaten it. Best hospital ive been to, far better than the QE and any other birmingham hospital. The reviews talk about the car park but its the staff and cleanliness that is important as your not parking once your admitted. I agree it is not great but it isnt anywhere. My surgeon Mr Alok Ray was great as he knows what he is doing, so reassuring and calm it goes a long way.",5
"Directions and signage is terrible. A & E should be the first thing you see and should be easily accessible. I had to drop my father at the doors, (I was unable to assist him due to other circumstances) he couldn't see which is why he was there and could barely walk. He gets to the doors and it's closed. Signs for a different entry are not clear especially for someone struggling to walk and there was no one around to direct or help. When phoning reception to ask whether someone could sit with him I was transferred to A&E where I was on hold for half an hour (I know they are busy which is why I asked reception). I hung up and rang again and they transferred me to A&E before I could even say that I'd been on hold for half an hour, to then wait another 15 minutes to talk to someone. No one had knowledge on any rule changes now that restrictions have been lifted and overall a very stressful and confusing journey just to get a little bit of information and to get him into the hospital.",1
"If you are referred to UHC Coventry by your GP, tell them you want to go to a different hospital, or go by bus or taxi. It doesn't matter if you are disabled, you still have to pay for the car park, and even then you will be lucky to find a place.  You will drive round and round, not find a parking space and then find that you either have to pay for your driving round, or get a £100 fine for not paying. Be aware that even if you have a blue badge and park in a Disabled space you still have to pay for parking. Finding out this gem of information cost me £100 because I assumed that like every other hospital, disabled parking would be free.
I'll never go there again   .   .    .    .    . but perhaps that is all part of their plan to reduce patient numbers",1
Can't fault the medical care but this has got to be the worst hospital in the UK to park. This nightmare has been going on for at least 10 years. There is not enough parking spaces for the staff let alone patients. It can take 45 minutes to find a space. Patients do not need this stress when they are visiting a hospital under already stressful conditions. Not difficult to sort out they just need a multi storey. Run by a bunch of idiots,3
My daughter was taken in by ambulance at 11.00 o'clock. She was suffering very high blood pressure and server head aches thay didn't treat the high blood pressure thèý sead it's a migraine and gave heŕ some medication tha made her sick.  Then iñ the same 9 hours she was there they took heŕ blood pressure 3 times . Around 08.00 the following morning they sent hèŕ home with  medication for a migraine she didn't have only to be told later that she shouldn't have  discharged.  When we tyres to phone to find out what has happened we was told they couldn't do anything thing about it as it was the other shift that had discharged her. In my view they discharged the wrong person and they are trying to cover it up  looks like they can't run a tap to full a bath .,1
"Iam so sorry that I have to post this, as my care has been wonderful.
But this parking disaster is a nightmare, and it's now a lottery if you get a ticket or not!!
This is not patient care, this is the biggest anxiety trip ever!!
OK ten minutes free parking, but that rarely takes into account you're driving round and round to get a space!!
Then when youre parked rush to your appointment, then visit the machine, pay the charge, go back to your car, wait in the queue to get out and bingo the camera at the entrance gets you again and of course you are over the time you paid for!! £100 joke!!! 😡",1
Not quite happy... I was in labour ward and next day my partner came to visit me. He paid for car the car park for the time he was with me. After a week we received a letter about parking penalty for £100. We have the parking receipt for the day but when we appealed to the car parking they answered that that's not enough of proof. So what proof we need?,2
"SOME staff are friendly, approachable, kind and know how to smile! Unfortunately, most are not. I have been here on numerous occasions, to different departments, as support for others as well as personal appointments. Ignorant, curt and dismissive are just a few descriptive words ..unfortunately it's more often than not, the department reception staff (your first point of contact)!
The central waiting area is horrendous. A terrible environment for anyone who is remotely anxious about their appointment.
Parking. Well, what is their to add that hasn't already been commented on by so many.

48hrs after my last review..im back at UHCW with my daughter for a pre-approved urgent referral from our local Hospital.
Simply do not have the physical or mental capacity to detail the 9hr wait, but I will say that the surgeon fell over herself apologising for the terrible and unnecessary wait/treatment we'd had!! Hideous. Arrived at 18.45, got home at 05.34 (we live 15mins away), and no further ahead in treatment. Been promised an urgent referral for the coming week.....lol.
Btw....looking after your appearance is important ladies, and its nice to see that you make the effort to look tidy and presentable, but drop the (head to toe) look of disgust that we all don't arrive at the ED looking like we've had 4hrs to prepare for our visit....",1
"Great hospital. Staff are all very professional and friendly easy to approach. Truely rate reproductive medicine here as they helped me concieve my son.
1 thing that didnt sit to well was there mental health services which was pretty shocking other than this the hospital have been excellent.",5
"Arrived after referral from out of hours gp at A n E at 9:15 pm 13th Nov  , waiting time was 6-7 hours . Went through reception and then triage for blood test. Turn from doctor came at 2:23 am  who after looking at the blood and symptoms reports cleared me of meningitis which Gp suspected. Then doctor said she will come back in 5 minutes or so and then arrived after 20 minutes to tell me that we now want to check you for malaria. And the way she took the blood sample of my right hand was horrible and painful .Needle was hanging with one end injected in my hand and the other rotating while she was pulling the blood . And when she removed the needle considerable blood drops were dripping on my hand and in her tray .  area of my hand where needle was inserted is swelled  up and very painful. Doctors shouldn’t be allowed to take blood as they are not experts like nursing staff.
Now awaiting for the malaria test and chest xray results which they said will come in 2 hours like the previous test but now its been almost 4 hours and have spent the whole night at A n E.

For patients waiting they need to create some sort of notification when their turn is about to come up incase one had to go to toilet or go to buy something to eat .

Sitting area for such long waiting time should be good enough for patients to sleep as they are there at night after full days work

Needs considerable improvement",2
I found the waiting time for my appointment amazing quick.,5
"parking is a disgrace. Also, the blood test team is not great, waited for 1 hour for my test. What is the point to book appointment if you cannot keep the time? Moreover, when I was late yesterday for 10 mins for my test, they told me I have to rebook. Clearly double standards here.",1
"There are three redeeming features of this hell-on-earth. First, the staff are really nice and friendly; second it seems to have every department there has ever been; and thirdly, if you happen to be flush enough to treat yourself, there's a M&S on site.
However, the parking is an absolute nightmare. I've never experienced worse. Truly horrible. And that's only by the time you've queued through the entry roads. There are idiots everywhere, in particular a set of entitled middle aged women who seem to think it's OK to sit in the car park with their engine running, window down, whilst smoking a cigarette. ""it has to be on the charge my phone"" one misinformed hag told me.
The place is busy. Like as busy as alton towers out of school term, only worse because at least at alton towers the line you're waiting in will go eventually, instead here your reward is another queue to stand in, or another waiting room to sit in.
Appointment times are 'a guide' ; my guide is, if you leave your house at the appointment time, get to the hospital and then spend an hour trying to park, half an hour trying to find your department/clinic, 20 mins going back to find a toilet because you didn't want to piss yourself in the car or in front of the clinic reception clerk, then you still have 3 hours to get some sleep in the waiting room. Which you will need because if you told work you'll have to have a few hours off but end up with the whole day, you'll be going back in the evening so get sleep while you can.",1
"I had an operation here in 2008. I was not advised of the procedure until the morning of the operation. The procedure was to deliberately damage my good eye to compensate for an eye that had been damaged in an accident instead of fixing the damaged eye. This increased the problem 10 times.
I have been struggling now for 8 years. The only think the hospital offered was to try to fix this problem but if someone has damaged you by bodging your operation then you would not let them touch you again. I have never felt the same since and have recently had my MRI scans that have shown damage from an infection. They suspect it was from this operation.
You go into hospital and get worst.
I would approach this establishment with high caution
Byron",1
Had to go to hospital almost 10 days in a row to support my mother who has a major operation. 10 days off continuous parking  was ridiculously expensive. No help available at all. Should have a weekly pass option. Something needs to be done about the parking. Robbing people.,2
"While I was pregnant I was under the care of Coventry hospital, and am I both so angry and upset with the way I was treated. If you are pregnant - please avoid this hospital at all costs as they can't seem to deal with any complications. I had to call around other hospitals myself to get looked after - I ended up at John Radcliffe in Oxford for my CVS (amazing hospital and staff) and at Birmingham Womens Hospital for my medical abortion (baby was very sick). I was also supposed to be under the care of the special midwife team for heart complications - not that they picked up their phone or called me back at any point in the process. My close friend had exactly the same happen to her, but in Nottingham, and she was looked after so well from start to finish. I am truly upset I was not looked after during this horrible time.",1
"Went there today after been advised by nhs 111 for my 11 year old son. Initial wait time was 3 hours when I checked in. After sitting around for 5 hours i went to check how much longer and i was rudely told there's another 7 people before he's seen. When you have a sick child sitting in A&E for so long with dirty toilets and rude staff, it's disgraceful. I left without been seen with the hope of trying again tomorrow to get a doctors appointment.  YOUR CHILD WILL DIE BEFORE THEY DO ANYTHING. The NHS is a disgrace",1
our premature baby was born here. Nurses were mostly nice altho a couple seemed like they didn't want to be there. And the doctors had differing opinions so gave us different I go which was a ball ache.  The worst thing tho is the ridiculous parking facilities. Most people who visit hospital are already stressed so it doesn't help that there aren't enough parking spaces So you find ur self driving around looking for a space instead of being with loved ones. And if u violate the parking rules u out of desperation you get £50 fine. and parking costs a £8.50 a day for the privilege of being able to see ur newborn. Horrible experience that I hope I never have to go through again. The only reason I haven't given one star ifs because the care provision was okay.,2
Unbelievable incompitence. A friend went in for an operation at time and date as printed on a letter. They turned up and was informed that they had forgotten to book it in at the Hospital. Whoever forgot should be sacked as they are obviously not up to the job. But i must say all the nurses and doctors are all hard working and and very good.,1
"A family member was admitted to this hospital as an emergency.  3 weeks later still going back n forth.   You cannot find a nurse or doctor to literally save a life.  Car parking is ridiculous. Who ever is making money from sick people , I hope god has an extra special plan for you.",1
"My Mother-in-Law was admitted and passed away whilst there, my wife and I live in Suffolk. The Staff could not have been more helpful, Understanding and Compassionate, although they must deal with this everyday they made it feel like she was the only lady on the ward in that situation, and my wife was special to them. A great team and a Great Hospital and all an asset to Coventry and Hospital staff everywhere. The one Big, Big, Big pain in the backside is the parking. If the money went to the hospital it would not be so bad, but a, Trying to park, it would take over 45 minutes regularly to park some times longer, and then have to pay over £8 a day for the privilege over 3 weeks it was £168, Also the only place you can get something to drink, the Canteen and the coffee shop are shut at night, no vending machines or anything else. So after a 4 hour drive there is nothing there and the W H Smiths is total money making Rip Off over £3 for a cheese sandwich with the sides curled up knowing that they have a captive clientele. That is what the Hospital should be ashamed of also making their staff pay £8 per day for parking for the privilege of working there ?",2
"The hospital it’s self is very good with good caring people! However I am disgusted at the car parks! The company who run it are incompetent and the system they use for the NPR is a joke, it only works correctly 30%-40% of the time. The other time it doesn’t work correctly and you think you have done all that is necessary and paying the correct amount you will be given a penalty notice to pay immediately! We disputed it and they wrote back saying we are still at fault but they will let us of this time and if our car is caught again miss using the car park we will be charged the full amount!
Please can the company running the car park look at your system and business practice as it’s a disgrace to patients and worse a bigger disgrace to a patient at end of life with there families trying to be there with them only to be caught out by a incompetent car park company!",4
A fantastic hospital with truely caring staff. My mother has been in the critical care unit for a month due to a brain haemorrhage that nearly killed her. Not only have they saved her life but made it a pleasure for her to recover due to all of their efforts. Not many could do what they do and I can't rate the staff highly enough. Their patience and caringness has not gone unnoticed by me and my family. Thank you to everyone that has helped. You are truly all amazing. Thank you.,5
Waiting times to die for. One shouldn't arrive with acne only to leave with dementia. Staff are great and really hard working but  parking :-) .  Parking is really badly laid out and on 24 hour supervision by an army of failed the IQ test wanabe Special Forces rejects..  Two entrances and no barriers to the parking areas would make so much more sense and then simply replace all the Special Forces rejects with parking meters.,2
"I was referred by my GP for a condition that ended-up needing a 5.5 hour operation and three days on the surgical ward.

The initial consultation, pre-op assessment, surgery, and ward care were slick, unhurried, and world-class. Everybody I dealt with was utterly professional, concerned that I understood all my options, risks and the processes involved at every step, and their goal was for the best long term outcome; cost and inconvenience to them didn't factor in.

When I got spooked by a slight change in my wound 8 weeks afterward, I called the ward,  was invited to return to the ward at 8:00am the next day, and was seen by the registrar at 8:10 am who was supportive and understanding, examined me and put my concerns to rest.

I don't believe I could have had better care at any price.",5
"Disgusted!!!!! Smoke free hospital & you see numerous people including patients smoking right outside entrance doors!
Staff egnored me informing them about lady struggling & waiting 10 minutes to be taken to the toilet.
In accident in emergency waiting over 5hours in a corridor when my sister needed to keep away from infectious people. I was mortified!

Patients need to be assessed in more detail so they know if mentally they are suited to specific wards. My poor sister had a lady going into her cubicle, shouting/screaming etc at her making her very upset.

Whilst visiting my sister the lady opposite decided to have a cigarette in the patients toilet-absolutely disgusted!!!!! I had to notify the nurses & did not seem at all interested. My sister was nearly sick from the smell of cigarettes when the lady sat back in her bed.

I cut my hand on a chair when visited! Ohh plus nearly slipped walking down the mile stretches of corridors as people dropping food skins/half eaten sandwiches on the floor.

Very disgusted with this hospital. Alot more needs to be done to improve the numerous faults/complaints.",2
Hi I have just spent 3 weeks on the vascular ward 22A my stay during that time I can not fault it them nurses worked very hard every day and their health care assistants as well the care I received was brilliant and the food was good as well. Also the surgeons and doctors were good thank you.,5
"Would rather go another hospital,care is bad here management couldn’t run a piss up in a brewery",1
"Terrible hospital.
Closing alot of local hospitals This hospital is just to busy.
Kept my nan on a corridor for 24 hours.
Twice missed my nans cancers in  different scans was only until she was in pain they finally found it.
Now it's to late.

Had my kids there unfortunately both times was absolute chaos.

Parking is a joke aswell they need a bigger car park or buy some land not far and have buses and they charge a absolute fortune. Making money on the sick and dieing.",1
"Would rate 0 stars if I could
Staff here are friendly and do a good job but the Parking is so terrible it detracts from every positive this hospital has. Turned up 50 minutes before my appointment , I am now 15 minutes late and still am looking for a space. The parking at this place is so inept it is beyond anything I have ever experienced before. What should’ve been 30 minutes in and out Is now an hour and a half which I’m sure is now going to cost me a small fortune. For future appointments I am going to specifically request they not be here it’s just not worth the hassle",1
Absolutely disgusted with the treatment my pregnant partner has been dealt with !! I have sung this hospital’s praises for over 15 years until now ! No words can explain the stroy,1
"The worst place to go. DO NOT GO TO WALGRAVE hospital. My blind and disabled brother had to stay for 2 or 3 nights for tests and scans for his kidney and heart failure. I had to bring him back home the first night. As a diabetic, he asked to check his blood glucose, and was tested 3 hours later, and then with low low levels, was refused food. Even though he wasn’t required not to eat, for example for a test or scan. Worst place to go, don’t listen, don’t take on board any concerns, very bad attitude problems by staff, nurses and doctors",1
You are absolutely disgrecafull.... My wife was in hospital in labour for 3 days and I paid for all parking ticket each day but I recived parking charge of 100£. Despite the fact that I showed receipts I still been charged and they do not accept this as a proof. Machine was broken and it didn't find my registration number but I still paid for the parking manually  and I have proof. Avoid !!!!! Disgusting.....,1
There are only 3 words to describe this hospital and that is to AVOID AVOID AVOID! it's the worst hospital I've ever had the unfortunate pleasure to be treated in! For some unknown reason everytime I have the unfortunate pleasure to visit this hospital for treatment they have got me down as deceased! Only for me to tell them that as they can see I'm very much alive! I've even been told that I have had a colonoscopy procedure done at a hospital in Milton Keynes instead of university hospital Coventry! I could write a book with the unfortunate experiences I've unfortunately have had to endure at this hospita!l as I said earlier if you are looking to be cared for and treated with dignity compassion and above all respect I would advise you very strongly to look for and attend another hospital elsewhere as you will certainly not get it here! The staff are rude incompassionate and have no empathy or respect whatsoever ! And  everytime you try to phone reception they never answer the phone you've got more chance of getting through to the man in the moon! As I said earlier in my review  AVOID AVOID AVOID!,1
"Thank you to NHS!
11 hours in E&A 😂",1

"I have nothing but praise for the staff and hospital facilities at UHCW. The parking facilities are another thing entirely. I take 30mins to get to the hospital, and then 45 mins to park. It's ridiculous. The security don't help and are rude. I don't think the car parks are owned by the hospital either, so who ever does, is making a mint at the expense of people trying to see loved ones or having medical attention. Even the ambulances have to queue sometimes. I went in yesterday, and I'm back there today - not looking forward to it at all!!!",4
"Can't fault the hospital staff, always helpful and friendly.  The only drawback is trying to get a parking space.  Took me over an hour once to get from the traffic lights to the main door to drop off my elderly mother!!  The only route to both the drop off zone and the nearby car park is on the same narrow road, so if there is a queue - as more often than not there is, then you're stuck in that!  Horrendous planning, and high parking charges. Also, trying to get into the car park after dropping off point is not easy, you either do a 3 point turn in the road, or have to go right back to the roundabout to get back.  Crazy!!",4
"Ruth Rochford Fearn
Today 1st September I attended a appointment in the antenatal/ gynaecology clinic. I was really anxious about the appointment but I needn't have been the nurse the junior doctor Mr Feras Izzat were so lovely Made me feel at ease and explained everything clearly to me. I just want to say thank you you all do amazing jobs 😊😊",5
"I am an internist (physician) from India and was completing a clinical attachment here. As a doctor, there's excellent clinical exposure. As most people who will be reading this review will be patients or patients' well-wishers, I will attempt to tell you what I'm giving this place 4 stars. The canteen is good, moderately priced.  The toilets are tidy.  The hospital itself is clean.  The only drawback are long waiting times and that's not entirely the hospital's fault.  The doctors here are amongst the best.",4
"My elderly mother recently had heart surgery here: the care was unfailingly excellent. I can't speak highly enough of the surgeons, nursing, and support staff.
The parking is horrible though - I found it less stressful to rent a private space off site on the days I was visiting and walk to the hospital",5
Was referred urgently by my optician to the ophthalmology department as I had a detached retina. On arriving at 16.35 I was told the department was closed and I would have to go to A&E. Even though I showed my opticians letter to A&E I was not seen until 19.00 by the nurse practitioner. At 21.00 I was given a head scan and discharged at 22.45 without ever seeing an ophthalmologist and was told to come back the next day. I arrived at Opthamology at 8.30 the next day and eventually told that the 2 consultants who could treat me were away today. They did ring around to find where I could be treated and I was lucky that a consultant at Warwick Hospital agreed to see me and operated on my eye the following day. I could have lost my sight in the affected eye at any time and so in my opinion A&E and opthamology at this hospital are not fit for purpose when it comes to eye emergencies.,1
I have rang this hospital (main number and ward number (a&e major ward) over 300 times over the last 24 hours.  Nobody answers and then the line is busy and when it becomes available STILL nobody answers. Nobody updates you on anything and ever get backs to you. Disgusting service.,1
"A&E waiting times are really bad, 8 hours wait and rude doctor who gossips",1
"The building is very dreary, with an endless length of closed in corridors and walkways, so I am not surprised to find that the architect was more used to building prisons. I expect that my great, great, great grandchildren will will still be paying off the PFI costs for this inelegant mess. In contrast to the building both nurses and doctors are delightful. My wife and I have dealt with 6 consultants between us and found all of them to be approachable and very helpful. I visit the Day Unit at Ward 34 every 2 weeks or so and have always found the staff to be supportive, cheerful and accommodating, though I suspect they may be overworked at times.  Well done to them all!",5
"Large regional university hospital, parking can be a big problem depending on the time of day. Efficient outpatient department but waiting area gets very hot in sunny weather .",4
"The NHS and the University Hospital responded rapidly and so efficiently to my Doctor’s urgent request of last week for a Gastroscopy Report. The endoscope check on me today was conducted so professionally and with the utmost of care, attention and consideration.
My thanks and extremely high regard to the three Hospital staff who completed my endoscopic procedure...Diana Del Rosario, Donna Wilson, and Maura De Chavez.  My thanks and appreciation as well to all the support staff who “processed” me through so professionally and considerately...the young man on the Endoscope Reception, Gemma who advised and prepared me prior to the procedure room, and the departure nurse who ensured that I was able and comfortable prior to arranging for my collection by my wife.
My sincere thanks to you all who looked after me today and many thanks also to the NHS for providing such a professional, supportive and considerate team to look after me.",5
"BEWARE CAR PARK SCAMMING IN PROGRESS.
I spent over 30 minutes looking for parking. My Dad was in AMU and needed antibiotic eye drops that the hospital did not have in stock. I couldn't get parking and had to get back to work. 4 days later I get a threatening letter saying that I have to pay £100 for a parking fine!!! I didn't park anywhere. There was no parking in the A&E car park!
This is a scam that is affiliated with the Hospital. When the Hospital is busy, it can easily take over 30 mins to try and find parking. If no parking is available in those 30 mins, you will get a fine.
I have visited the security office which is just full of Chavs who don't even know how to tie their shoe laces. When questioned about this, their response was ""Dunno mate, I just work here"".
I don't understand how the Hospital is getting away with this. I am NOT paying the £100 fine and I am contemplating taking the Hospital to the small claims court. People visit the Hospital to see loved ones who may even have a terminal illness and the idiots running the Hospital are smiling in glee by implementing these car park scamming tactics robbing more money from the taxpayer.",1
"Took my mum for an appointment today. Carpark was hard to locate and was chaos. Mum couldn't walk the distance from car so I went to the main entrance to be greeting straight away by an information desk. Approached and asked where could I get a wheelchair from. All I got was an unhelpful ""I don't know, you'll have to look for one!"" SO unhelpful!!! Gent came after asking for directions and he got ""you need to ask them over there"".....pointing at reception. What was this ladies purpose? Her name I think was Bernice. Know shes a volunteer....but volunteer what? chair warmer?!!! Anyway I grabbed another volunteer guy with a wheelchair and asked where I could get one. He rushed a guy to fracture clinic and returned straight away for my mum. Then said once finished to return to the desk and wait for tom. Did so and tom was amazing too. These 2 guys are such an asset to you at the hospital. Maybe should have a wheelchair park like warwick.....£1 in like trolleys in the supermarket......",3
All good disabled parking is free as long as you register number plate with security,5
"I have never been treated more respectfully in my life. I canot be more grateful for the kindness and profesionalism of the doctors and nurses. The lady doctor treating me stayed by my side making sure the procedures were done correctly and that i could be relieved of the excruciating pain that i had.
After being admitted the nurses made sure i am comfortable and they treated me with great care. After such an experience one receives a better perspective on life and how important  the nhs is.
Thank you once again.",5
"Terrible. Sent by my doctor to the Eye Department. , Waited along with dozens of others - seven hours for to be seen by specialist. This place covers a huge area and I and others I met had travelled 20 - 30 miles to get there. If I had come by car and parked there I should have been bankrupt. Chaos and poor organisation abounds. Patients treated with contempt. How can this happen in a so-called first world country?",1
"Unfortunately, today this place turned in evil third class country hospital. My child was discharge after 6 hours waiting in MDU department with the severe skin condition without giving him any tritment.  Nurse forget to take neadle from his arm after they took his blood test and doctor said to 17 yo, don't worry you will not die when child was in agony. I am come from Eastern Europe, Ukraine, myself and I never had so bad treatment even there. This is civilised Europe and young people mistreated severally.",1
"Just before christmas last year my dads own doctors and hospital 200 miles away wrote him off and gave him little time and discharged him. So him and mum came to spend christmas with us. Boxing day my dad became so ill we nearly lost him. But the amazing care and medical treatment my dad received from this hospital not only saved his life against all odds but after 8 months of him living with me so they could continue to treat him, They have literally given him his life back.  We will always be unbelievably greatful to all the staff for all their hard work. Thank you so very much.",5
"Went for a routine check at the opticians who sent me to A&E eye casualty with a swollen optic nerve, had 4 different people say the same thing with no resolution to it, felt like clapping 'well done you're the 4th person to tell me I have a swollen optic nerve'. Keep getting referred, referred and referred. Waiting time is ridiculous and so far they've been as helpful as a chocolate tea pot over a period of months. Researched the condition myself and will deal with it myself as it's not bothering me and can apparently clear itself up. This hospital is wasting tax payers money, it's more like a business. No wonder people are fed up of the NHS.",1
Expensive car parking.  Doctor wasn't onetime for my appointment.,4
"Ward 22 staff are very stretched, they do the best they can with very little resources. They are polite and helpful but i have saw an increase in members of the public being rude and abusive to the staff of which is uncalled for",4
Worst hospital in Coventry. Disgusting conditions and some staff need to take more responsibility. They need to realise people who are in their hospital require urgent care. They need more beds and staff who actually want to do their job properly instead of dosing around. This is wasting ours and the patients valuable time. Honestly I would rate it 0 stars if I could but unfortunately I can’t.,1
"I wanted to visit a friend who has been in Universityhospiral for at least 3 days....but they have no record of him being admitted.....yet he messaged to say he was in the place......!!!.
Poor service from a supposedly top hospital.....????.....yes, indeed.",1
"I am typing this review after receiving a letter from a company called ParkingEye Ltd trading as Car Parking Partnership. This is the company who is sending out threatening letters and asking for the payment of £100.
I visited the Hospital with my daughter who has Cancer. After driving into the car park, it was full. I waited amongst other cars that were infront. As there was no spaces, my daughter walked to her appointment. I drove out the car park and went home. I then took a taxi into the Hospital to be with my daughter. Today I receive a letter demanding that I pay £100?
What for? I didn't park anywhere??
Does anyone know who the chairman is of the UHCW?
This is disgraceful and the people running the Hospital should be ashamed of themselves. It is obvious and clear that the person running the car parking company has given someone involved in running the Hospital a fat brown envelope to implement their robbing facility in the Hospital grounds.
Why hasn't anything been done about this?",1
"Went into A&E and had the misfortune of being dealt by someone called Abdul. He spent his time yawning at me instead of listening. If you get him, ask for a another doctor.",1
Could not organise a piss up in a brewery! Total lack of communication between departments! Total lack of communication with patient's. Sent me home with a open wound after i spent 11hrs waiting for surgery! Did not dress my wound just sent me home and asked if i could come back another day. Then i returned to waste another day sat waiting with open wound still not dressed or cleaned! Chances of getting fixed slim to none. Avoid this place like the plague! Refuse to be brought here at all costs.,1
"The service was good and the ultrasound check was quick. However, the medical staff was unpolite. Dr.PG JOHNSON and her assistant Kim Brett were both disrespectful and did not allow me to ask any questions. Moreover, they kept rushing me out of the room eventhough it took me less than 30 second to put my clothes on although the waiting room was empty.",1
"The eye clinic is second to none for treatment & care. My husband was advised by Optician to come straight over & that he would be seen,  that was 10 days ago. Back today for a check up & his progress is amazing.
The staff & Drs can't do enough.
Many thanks",5
Treated really bad my the hospital and police and social services has regards my daughter sad because before it changed l had a good experience l give an it a 1 because of the kind care assistant or domestic gave me a cup of tea l was told go home l missed the bus l was stranded . The services did not have a problem in locked down when l was looking after 7 member of my family  😢,1
"Very badly run hospital, it's true that if you go in with a minor injury you leave with a more serious illness. Place isn't clean as cleaners stand around gossiping. Nurses pretend to keep me there until after 10.30 so they can claim night rate. Very nasty place and a visit to A&E can take up to four hours to be seen. The parking is a joke and it's common knowledge that there are serious financial problems. When I complained they took offence and got the CEO or whoever runs the place to write to me direct. Doesn't he have anything better to do?? So unprofessional.....if you value your health go to another hospital you have a choice now",1
"Had trouble getting through to the ward on the phone (well, I never did manage it), and the parking was brutal - difficult and expensive.  BUT the treatment my very elderly and sick aunt received there before her death was sensitive, caring and loving.  I don't think you can fake these things - the compassion was genuine.",4
"I went to A&E as I had open wounds that were to giving me pain. I was there for two and a half hours and I got my blood test done. When examined by the doctor, he said to go to my GP to get it cleaned. I call my GP and they said A&E should have cleaned. Well that's great service isn't it. So A&E want to get rid of me and my GP dont want to know anything about. Great NHS service....",3
"Took My Uncle  yesterday to Urology  Dept for an appointment  following his diagnosis  of Prostate Cancer  in Feb 2019. My Uncle also has Alzheimers! Very superficial (late) perfunctory appointment  with a consutant where we were told us what we allready knew. No follow up  since Feb 19 till now- and then this nothingness! Shameful!
I am very disappointed  at the way my uncle has been treated.
I have only praise  however, for how I myself and my mother have been dealt with in other departments of the Hospital in the past.",1
"Having used Walsgave hospital for my father, over several months,at the beginning of the year
from the diagnosis and treatment of his cancer to his eventual discharge service, I can only say from the paramedics to the doctors and nurses on the wards, the discharge staff, I cant fault, and indeed, praise their care and professionalism  under demanding circumstances. In a world where customer service seems to have been abandoned by most, I cant praise them enough.
Only down-points were parking charges and the waiting for endless hours on a trolley in the corridor in A and E with trolleys with people in distress and pain round the block,but that ofcourse is down to our lovely Government of the day.",5
If you're about to have a baby please do avoid this place. We've had the worse experience ever. We delivered our first baby in Luton hospital but we weren't treated so badly. They really did not care at all about my wife or the baby. We felt like they were forced to do anything for us. Don't even know why they kept my wife overnight cause she would have been treated a lot better at home. I'm really disappointed in this hospital and hope I'll never have to come back here ever again.,1
"My daughter is newborn (19 day) she was crying from 6am to 6:30pm Bkz of colic, after many contact to GP they told us, go to children emergency Uni Hospital, we came here 7:15pm now it’s 11:26pm doctor called her. And my daughter cried these hours. It’s really disappointed 😔
Thanks for your services and help.",1
"My wife and I(accompanied mywife)  was attended ultrasound scan on 19th NOV at first floor west wing for my wife.  The Sonographer was completely disgusting. Not helpful, no information, no proper response. Before the scan itself she said, not sure of results and anything could go wrong.  The communication was not good. I think she had problem with MEN. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE HER FACE IN LIFETIME.
Absoule disgusting. Just she is doing scan only one side of stomach. Not doing to other side. I do not know why. And asked my wife to move stomach strongly to move baby. Why do not do scan to otherside.
End of the day, sonographer communication not good, not given any information. without giving any information, said to go rececption and book one more appointment.

Before attending appointment, we were in waiting room. There staff 3-4 memebers gathered in waiting room and whispering to each other(absolutely not me or patience), but how NHS is paying money (peoples taxes) to staff to waste there time.

I would never recommend Coventry University Hospital.
Feel free to message, I will give my appointment details and you can track the information.

Receiptionst given appointment, and she said no other appointments available. I tried calling First floor west wing ultrasound scan receiption, but not responded to call. I tried morethan 30times.

THIS HOSPITAL IS NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Leave plenty of time for parking, I arrived on the hospital grounds 45 minutes before my appointment.  I was 15 minutes late for my appointment because of the queue for the carpark.  The worst parking situation I have ever seen at any hospital, it feels like they consolidated wards from surrounding hospitals but then forgot to do anything about the influx of people needing to park.  Only 3 carparks and one parking structure.  Something needs to change.",3
"This hospital has really gone downhill, really really gone downhill.

In an era where covid-19 prevent relatives from visiting, you would hope that they would at least provide you with timely information.

Ward 22 Vascular in particular. Three phonecalls, never a callback and almost impossible to find anyone with a competent grasp of the English language.

I will be putting in a written complaint with hospital management as I don't feel it is acceptable for a patient to be in hospital for four nights, without next of kin being provided with any updates or information.",1
"This place is a JOKE. My partner had a stroke and was not seen for 7 hours, then he wanted to find out the results of a brain scan but was informed by the the Registrar that he was too busy to talk to you!!! He was told he had suffered a bleed on the brain from a domestic wh looked at his notes for him. Parking situation is atrocious and the staff in the wards and the patient liason are disgusting to deal with. Staff on wards ignored elderly patients falling out of bed or asking for water. Should be sacked the LOT OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"UHCW are doing everything right.  From the moment I was greeted warmly at Reception in Clinical Science building today, the brilliant interviewing staff in Administration and to the scary moment I realised I'd left my personal file in the car park!

Security Staff deserve a 5 star medal for retrieving my file so quickly and for thinking on their feet.  I cannot thank you guys enough for your help and going the extra mile, you truly made me feel valued.

The guys in construction who also helped out, they didn't have to, but they ran into the building and found out what had happened.  The whole experience has renewed my faith in humanity. THANK YOU!",5
"Call up a couple times after no contact for several months. No one answered any of my questions (if they even answered the phone). Left a message for a nurse, heard nothing since. One woman checked my records and said asked if I'd been diagnosed with something, which was the first I'd heard of anything after months of numerous tests. Thinking I might have to go there in person and just wait until someone actually comes and talks to me.",1
"This hospital got the chance to give covid vaccinations. The very first person got the vaccination here. Well, they made a huge mistake, how on Earth the nurse, who should be professional, didn't wear gloves on this occasion??? Especially in this situation when she had to touch the patien's skin and she should know it's a big NO without gloves. Yeah she did with bare hand. I'd not have vaccination from that nurse. The photographer just took a picture of an unprofessional person and it was attached to the article. Shame on the nurse",1
I had an emergency scan at the hospital when I was 26 weeks pregnant and ended up having to deliver at 27+2. The staff were amazing to me and I cannot thank the neonatal nurses enough for what they did for my daughter,5
"I had a Bladder prolapse Operation under the NHS but because of so many Operations being performed at University Hospital at that time I was sent to  Nuffield Private Hospital which was all fine. But I never had a 6 week follow up which I thought I should have had. After 14 weeks post op. I started bleeding and saw my own GP who referred me back to Coventry Hospital. I was told I couldn't see the Consultant until April 2015 I was very upset by this, but by phoning the Consultants Secretary and the Administration officer I did get called back last week and a Cauterisation performed which I'm pleased to say seems to have worked.",4
"Parking and ISS parking attendants are atrocious and expensive.
Hospital staff try their best but governed by paperwork and fixed computers. Information from doctors and consultants very poor even when asked directly. About time someone did a proper work study and activity level assessment and also reduced the number of locums thereby reducing expenditure.... Poor show!!",2
"16th Jan 2016 Car Parking at Walsgrave currently is an absolute nightmare! Visited today, arrived 45 mins early prior to appointment . Actually managed to get parked 10 mins after appointment should of taken place. The clinic I attended appreciated the phone call explaining my lateness and fortunately was still seen. To charge £4.10 when the first hour was spent literally trying to find a place to park is absolute disgrace. I really have never understood why we lost so many services at Rugby (down to funding and  better facilities will be available stated at the time) but after today's experience its apparent Walsgrave is not coping with the volume of visitors or traffic!",1
"My dad was in University Hospital for  3 months before he passed away. We can't thank the staff on Ward 42 enough for the way they looked after him. They became part of the family, the staff are pushed to the limits some times, but delivered 110%.Thank you.",5
Can't fault the medical staff or cleaners but the parking is insufficient extremely expensive. Eye wateringly expensive because there is only one entrance for all verchiles cars buses taxis ambulances if you have a 9 am appointment you need to give yourself an extra 40 minutes _an hour to get from the roundabout onto Ansty Road to the entrance. Also long delays when the helicopter takes off or lands. It can add a fiver to your taxi fare. If possible I'd advise a bus,4
"had a stroke in feb told about it in oct.
nursing staff and doctors are good when you get to see them but a lot has to be said about the upper management the place is a joke its just a cash cow.
phoning the hospital is also a joke at various times did not get to talk to anybody as no one would answer the phone.
hospital car park is nothing to do with hospital as far as hospital is concerernd yet security monitor it
great place to get treatment but no place to be ill",1
Our friend is in an intensive care ward with a brain tumour and I'm disgusted with the way he and his family have been treated. He has had a drain tube taking fluid from his brain.He has spent 9+ weeks in bed .Every week they tell his wife they will be operating and at the last minute change their mind.When we have visited he has been neglected with no help to drink water out of reach left practically naked and freezing cold.Our friend is out of her mind with worry because nothing is being done to help him or her.She was told today by the surgeon he will operate this week if he has time if not he'll see if it can go on someone else's list.What a disgusting attitude for someone in health care should be struck off. Seems like no one cares. Shame on this hospital's reputation. I've spent most of this year at Southmead hospital Bristol and the care there is second to none. Shame our friend isn't getting such good treatment. Perhaps he should get a transfer to a better hospital .Brian and Maureen Finka (Somerset),1
"My wife visited today for an ultrasound scan. Talk about poor customer service.  The staff were rude, to an extreme,  curt beyond believe and about as much use as a chocolate fire guard.  Apparently she hadn't drunk enough .. maybe a solution would be to offer her a drink but oh no, that would be too simple. They chose instead to say the could not do it. Absolutely farcical...not sure Graham Rix could have written a better script. Would be hilarious if it wasn't so disgraceful.  Went to Rugby immediately afterwards...maybe cov need to send their staff for lessons.",1
"absolutely fantastic ,attentive nursing staff,nothing too much trouble ,anything my wife needed was sorted straight away.I know our NHS has its problems but we can't fault the service we are experiencing.
The only irritation is the daily car parking fiasco - is this a product of the PFI contract?",5
"Nothing but praise for the staff but the parking situation is seriously stressful for out-patients and visitors alike.  Poor signage,  not enough pay machines which often break down and those that are working often not taking cards,  unfriendly car parking staff - it's a dreadful situation. Anyone thought about a Park and Ride?",3
My daughter has been in for over 3 weeks awaiting surgery and has been nil by mouth on 5 occasions and still not had it done. We are on ward 43 which is so under staffed,3
"Very very bad experience.
My mother after car incident get to this hospital by the ambulance she wait 4 hours to see the doctor with broken nose, with concussion, epistaxis and many small injuries.
They haven’t make X-ray because it was nothing available so we need come back today to sort everything with the nose and make X-ray. She can’t get out from bed and they recommend paracetamol 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️.
Very irresponsible😶",1
"After 3 Cancers I am still alive after 5 years.This superb facility keeps me checked without fail every 3- 6 months. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. My latest approval is trying to help with chronic arthritis. Leg appliance are supplied to try and further ones will be available if there is no major improvement. Offering to pay, I am told it is unnecessary.
Why don't they have a large bucket at the entrance where patients and visitors alike could put a nominal coin in such as 50p. A significant amount would accumulate to offer additional development for health benefits.",5
"So my son and my 2yr old grandson were transported to Coventry hospital by ambulance this morning although he is local to nuneaton upon been given all clear and been allowed home, in the panic of this morning my son realised he got no cash or card no gpay an no way of getting home when he approached the hospital they said was nothing they could do to help them get home so left stranded my grandson has not eaten or drank in hours.. all he needed was a way of getting into the city center an that point i could of get him a ticket home how do you think this exceptable when a patient has been brought in as a emergency by ambulance to then leave them stranded with a small child..",1
"My brother was airlifted here following a road traffic accident. Cannot fault what they done to try and save him but unfortunately he died of his injuries, also cannot fault the people in the family room and the Chaplin despite the day being a blur and don't remember much. Our problems came in the days after.... we identified his body on the day but they ""forgot"" to tag him (Police notified us this after 3days!) then they ""lost the body / paperwork for the coroner was incorrect person"" not sure what exactly happened here as nobody ever answered us this was about a week after the death. We got the body back 3 weeks after his death and nobody can answer why it took so long other than ""Walsgrave is known for taking there time and there has been several complaints"". My family was not able to pay respects in the chapel of rest because his body was too deteriated by the time our funeral director received the body which has caused distress to us all. If you can avoid this hospital like the plague!!",1
I have just spent the weekend in the Coronary Care Unit at Walsgrave - I cannot fault the nurses who are cheerful and work under demanding circumstances.  I had to discharge myself (my problem not their actions) but while I was there the treatment was considerate and thorough.  My doctor explained every step of what was going on.,4
Thank you for everything that you did for my father whilst he was attending the hospital. It's always a tough time for families too and you always made us all feel welcome when we rocked up with perhaps too many grandkids as well. The NHS is such a wonderful institution and we should all be so very very proud of what we have with out healthcare here. Thank you.,5
"Car parking issues are really bad, new system does not work.

"I had to go to Coventry hospital on Tuesday evening for severe vomiting,arrived at A&E at 01:30 got triaged and seen around 04:00 am,the A&E department was very busy.Went through to A&E where I did feel the nurse looking after me initially was dismissive of my problem,I had been vomiting all day,vomiting in A&E constantly,I was weak,tired,on the verge of collapse.The A&E Dr came and saw me he was ok I told him I have had similar episodes in the last 6 weeks which had left me to attend A&E.The blood tests came back which showed very low magnesium,calcium and potassium.Put on IV to replace these.Saw an absolutely wonderful Dr I can’t remember his name he was brilliant,attentive most of all listened to me.I then went onto AMU ward 12, the nurses were so lovely,attentive and caring I honestly had no faults with this department.It’s a very busy ward,the staff are working very hard you can see how busy they are,if only I could remember their names they were so good at their chosen vocation,exceptional honestly no faults.Thank you for looking after me.",5
"Absolutely terrible. The service is terrible and vile, the treatment is absurd. And they'll misdiagnose you and not give you the proper treatment for anything, even if you're begging and pleading. They'll just look at you and dismiss you. Absolutely rotten and vile.
Only go here if you want to suffer more and even worse. Wish I could put zero stars.",1

I feel for the staff as they are stretched. Need more funding to fund this wonderful hospital.",4

"I thought the Leicester Royal Infirmary was bad, having done the rounds at Leicester Royal Infirmary, Glenfield Hosital and General hosital, Nottingham Queens Medical center, Great Ormonde St, Salford Hospital, this is the worst hospital ever. I even went to the Private part of it and was treated really poorly. I noted the white people were treated with respect. I was told by the first traffic management guy did I not understand English. I said why are you shouting? I am from out of town, you are acting pedantically, you have a 40 min queue I am not stopping a Emergency Vehicle. Whats your problem? Dont you have any civility? Your signs end half way, you let in buses, other cars yet take issue with me? This was a theme that even the recptionists  took. The only person was Dr Dimitri who saw me! Come back Leicester Royal Infirmary all is forgiven.  The worst hospital ever! Coventry I know has an immigration problem but dont take it out on me!",1
Last week evening i came for my  ear pain and discharge the responsible say you have to wait 5 or 6 hour. I didn't wait came home and I wait with my pain till morning I came GP emergency,1
"Good luck with anyone trying to phone UHCW, I have wasted many, many hours of my life listening to ringing tones of the main hospital number that is never answered. The website says the hospital is open 24 hours a day, unfortunately the switchboard/reception is open 0 hours per day.",1
"If i could give it nothing i would. This hospital used to be a least a bit more better than it is now, but omg! 2 times i went recently and it has been the most dreadful experience, the doctors have some beef against each other and no one actually knows what they are doing! Stay away from the SURGICAL ASSESSMENT UNIT or go to a different hospital.",1
Cannot praise the bookings department and consultants enough for helping me out of a sticky situation.  Angela Scarsbrook (formerly Strike).  Thank you so much.  My family and I have always had the best treatment at this hospital.  We're lucky to have it!!,5
"Well , after arriving 30 mins early for a 10.15 appointment this morning . I Was unable to park my car. I was able to call the department and explain my dilema but still missed my appointment . After an hour of driving around I came home. What on earth is going on?",1
"........at the opening and nothing has changed my mind in 2016.  Too big, complicated, and a nightmare for the elderly with mobility issues, goodness know how the Disabled in general get on I dont know,  I (an OAP and I use one/two crutches to get around) was a few minutes late for an appointment with a Physiotherapist once, she was nasty and made me feel an idiot, all because I could not find where she was (NOT in the usual Physiotherapy department) even the wonderful volunteers were stumped on her whereabouts!

The Staff, all of them are so busy its crazy, but they are fantastic given the vast amounts of computer and paperwork they have to do. Go here as an emergency or with a very serious condition/Cancer and you will receive the very best care and attention. Other routine, run of the mill problems and the care drops down into its boots.  My personal opinion is once you hit 60 years old, it does not want to know, but thats another story............",1
"Utter joke. Bought in by paramedics and it took 3 hours to even realise I was THERE! I walked home, hopefully I survive  Christmas. I will not trust this place with my wellbeing ever again.",1
"My son had recent attack of croup.  Very distressing and frightening for him.  West Mids paramedic crew were great.  Son's condition improved slightly but advised us to have him checked out.  Went to children's A&E.  Doctor who assessed him was fantastic, very thorough, communicated exceptionally well.  Thank you UHCW.",5
"1. Had to re-visit 4 times in 6 weeks with emergency GP notes after having post operative complications after a C-Section.
2. Discharged with no bowel movement after 7 days, medical notes falsified- enema req.
3. Admitted to A&E for heavy bleeding- advised to be Nil-by-mouth for 72 hrs and received 1 meal on the off chance there was room for my procedure! Procedure did not occur.
4. Return on another emergency GP for same complication 7 days later!
No one listened and they seemed more concerned about patient turn over rather than solving the problem. Ridiculous",1
Absolute appealing my disabled mum was took in left in a hospital issue wheel chair so can't move unless pushed was taken in around 2pm I got there 7 pm at this point she had not been offerd to go toilet having very poor mobility she couldn't herself also being type 1 diabetic she did not have blood sugars tested in that time what is also appealing just left there come 1 pm I had to voice my opinions loudly and angry about the neglect having been sat there almost all evening to early hours of morning then within 5 minutes nurse come to take her to toilet a complaint had been placed they have lied about the time she went in to a and e as a service here it is disgusting and all the staff do is completely lie so to any one who plans on using the place please be carefull as they do neglect loved ones when on there own and no one there,1
"Worst hospital of all, they are negligent, and inhumane. Staff are rude and abusive (not on all wards) but some wards really need looking at, they need to implement training and improve the services as they are terrible.",1
"Horror…. I would give -0! In pain , ive been on A&E ,in pain… spend 3 hours , someone didnt even care too much about me, theh gave me paracetamol and codeine and they send me home…. Horror!!! And i have pain and im unwell! Thanks",1
"This message is for the m.s. section at University Hospital in Clifford Bridge Road, Coventry. I cannot say other than when I visit the Hospital they act in a professional and empathetic manner. However, this is something I really don't want to have to write....Again, there are problems with the non delivery of my Famprya medication. This has been going on for months, and needless to say is upsetting my wife and I profusely. We dread every month since Christmas with regard to deliveries, and my heart is in my mouth not knowing whether or not we will get a delivery. The way we have been treated by Healthcare at Home is absolutely appalling. I am at a loss to know why the NHS are still dealing with them, as they are undoubtedly not fulfilling their part of the contract. It looks as though they have the monopoly on drugs for various people, and they are playing with peoples lives. I have one day left of my drug, which as you know, I am self funding. If we don't get any satisfaction we will have to take the matter further.....something which I am loathed to do, but sadly we are left with no alternative. This is not a reflection on the m.s. section of University Hospital, but on the Company, namely Healthcare at Home they are dealing with. Healthcare at Home are impossible to contact, and we have spent endless hours, yes hours trying to get in touch with them. It is a disgrace, and this situation is certainly not helping my husbands condition. I have left a message on the m.s. nurses voicemail. At the time of writing we have not heard from them, but I am confident a call and explanation will be forthcoming. PLEASE, PLEASE HELP.....thus avoiding more unnecessary stress and upset.....not at all good for my condition....thank you",3
"Parking full again , gave up after sitting in traffic , dropped my friend off , whom really wanted me in with her, to help understand results and options .
Forced to park at nearby Tescos .
Appointments in Endocrinology was running 1 hour minimum late .
Staff as always wonderful.
Maybe someone should think about a multy story car park being built?",3
"Abismal my mum who had pneumonia was sent home twice with antibiotics after they said they could find nothing wrong, third time by ambulance to AE the doctor said X Ray showed right lung badly infected and part collapsed , a consultant attended her in the assessment ward and within 6 minutes he had diagnosed severe pneumonia and put her on 100% oxygen and the consultant was that concerned he pushed the bed himself to ward 12 again another assessment ward. Mum spent almost three weeks to in hospital and they put the family under tremendous pressure to discharge her ,staff 85% of nurses could not be bothered, moral is at rock bottom, 15% were outstanding. Mum now in Bede nursing receive ing outstanding care, pity the NHS can't do the same",1
"I had emergency surgery at this hospital and i could not fault them.

After surgery i was given dinner, a room and every hour they check up on me through out the night.

I would visit this hospital again, although i don't wish or plan too.",5
"I have regular physio here, Lucy is fabulous, listens to my queries and answers them patiently and thoroughly x",4
"Over 2 hrs waiting for a timed appointment. No information given, no estimation of wait time. Not bothered enough to call patients and ask to come later instead have 30 people in a small room sitting and waiting.",1
"No communication whatsoever, inhuman treatment, condescendent attitude, loads of useless paper carriers. Indolence at its best.",1
My 2 months old doughter was ill  we call the ambulance it came on time but they made as Wait for 10 hours in emergency department  area just to see by doctor the sarvice  was too slow and not helpful at all,1
"5 knee ops each time making it worse - think everyone on his team had ago - scary the last op he so called performed he needed to seek  advice off someone that was more familiar with the procedure after there was problems .so many lies and empty promises -Shocking bedside manner by all his staff - pals pointless - management what do they do again ? This being a huge ?? 2 small children missed out on so much quality time with their dad it's unreal . One of his comments let them run round the table for fun -constant""quit your job "" . 5 years to be in worse shape than I started  - new op zero knowledge on after care if it fails which it has!!",1
Waited 2 hours for a nurse to take us through a medical questionnaire that could have been done online. Then waited another 1 to see a doctor. What a waste. The wait to see a doctor could be optimised with the use of technology so sad to see the NHS behind the times,1
"DONT TRY TO PHONE THEM!  I was admitted after an accident.  The treatment was actually OK, but I explained I couldn't take tablets when they gave me antibiotics to take home.  I was told it was ok to dismantle the tablets and take the contents in water.  Luckily I checked with my doctor and it is certainly not OK... I needed liquid meds.  I had to phone the minor injuries department to ask them to send an electronic prescription to my home chemist as I couldn't drive after my accident so I phoned them.  HANGING ON FOR 20 MINUTES...... the switchboard completely uninterested and just left me hanging on, occasionally saying ""I'll try again for you"" but obviously just waiting for me to give up and go away.  I have two concerns a) WRONG PRESCRIPTION B) NOT ANSWERING PHONE.....",1
"The care and attention from both Paramedics, Nursing Staff and Consultant Oncologist for my son Gerald Travers was second to none, appreciate all the care and attention we received when attending A&E last evening.  I certainly rate them more than 5 Stars.  Gerry travers",5
"What a fantastic job all staff in A&E, Absolutely rushed off there feet & not a single moment they stand still especially resus, lovely staff even with none stop trauma coming in, people just don't realise what they do until you see it first hand, feel sorry for reception staff & triage staff as they get the brunt of the complaining people waiting hours, its not there fault it's that busy emergencies just keep coming in. Thank you A&E excellent work & great teamwork.",5
"Compassionate, caring and empathic,  Three words to describe the amazing staff on AMU where my father recently spent time before he  sadly passed away. Special thanks to Dr Gholap, Dr Reddy, Carrie, Beth, Davina and Leigh  for the care and dignity they gave dad and the support they gave to my brother and myself. It meant so much to us at a very difficult time.",5
"Firstly this review is reflecting ward 43, the ward is very understaffed causing patients not to get quality care, families/friends of patients are having to bed bath their loved ones, change their bedding, get them water, constantly call nurses for help but, due to the inadequate members of staff requests are being ignored or delayed for hours.
One family member witness a patient fall out of bed, no nurses around, another family member complained to a ward sister and was spoken too very rudely, I myself was spoken to very rudely and an agency worker poked my family member in the face of whom also had to wait one and half hours for pain relief as it was forgotten about causing her to vomit many times with the pain.
It’s a complete joke, you couldn’t make it up.

Come on NHS get the ratio of staffing right!!!",1
People in A&E work hard to look after you but once out on wards forget it it’s a shambles … nasty staff mainly bossy and lazy food poor v understaffed…drs think they are gods and act like it if you ever get to see one ps if your elderly good luck ….,1
"Absolutely rubbish, over 9h to be seen by a doctor.",1
"Everyone has been wonderful on every visit  i have made over last 9 years
Different to other hospitals I Could name",5
Admitted at 6am on a Saturday with suspected pneumonia x rayed tested diagnosed provided with the advice and medication needed ( and fed ) by very nice and relaxing staff. And out by 10 am. Best hospital experience I've ever encountered. Thankyou,5
"I came to this Hospital to have my daughter tested for Covid 19, for a pre op, I was told to go home and self isolate my daughter, her dad and myself from each other. How can you self isolate yourself from each other if you live in the same house!?! Once she as the test she can't go to School for 2 weeks, and myself and her dad can't go to work we have to self isolate, without getting the results.
What a load of rubbish we don't have any symptoms of Covid 19, so why on earth am I going to self isolate my whole family if we are not sick, plus you don't self isolate until you get the results in.
You can't self isolate from your own family in the same household ha ha.
I'm ashamed of the NHS, for miss leading patients.
None of us have any symptoms of Covid 19.",1
"University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire; used the facilities on many ocassions. The Hospital and the Doctors, staff from the janitors to all employed were very compassionate and highly professional in their duties.

A vey caring and selfless community working very hard to facilitate between patients and immediate family and friends concerned.

A great service to have in Coventry. Keep up the good work!",5
"I was taken in to the hospital on an emergency basis I found the staff very helpful…..as I’m not from the area ( I live 2+ hours away) the doctors bent over backwards to get me in for tests that I needed so I could be discharged at the earliest.whilst on the ward I didn’t have a phone charger one of the cleaners went down and purchased 1for me in her break time, the nurses were very professional at all times I wish we had that sort of service at the hospital where I live the only criticism I have is the food it was edible but only just other than that it was a 5* experience thank you Coventry hospital.",5
"I just witnessed some disgraceful scenes at the accident and emergency department today, a mentally ill man had come in for treatment and had collapsed on the floor while leaving, when he regained conscience nurses were shouting at him to move him out of the way as he was in a  corridor and eventually a security guard came and dragged him aside by the legs while the surrounding nurses were laughing about the situation.

Disgraceful actions, I cannot beleive these are the same people who are trusted to care for us when we are vulnerable. Truly sickening.",1
"Well!!
I had a racing accident at silverstone,I was flown by air ambulance to this hospital.
The care and attention i received was second to none,From the surgens who worked on my torn aorta 10 broken ribs collapsed lung etc etc,The doctors nuseres everybody involved were great and made my 10 days in hospital very comfortable,As of the food comments on here what do you expect the ritz?????? In my opinion i would ignore all the bad comments
regards Matt Edwards",5
"The staff is not even near to the appointments. Once or twice is ok but two times per week for three month is not acceptable. All above there is not enough parking space, and very expensive. On the other hand the staff is working really hard, and the doctors are good.",2
"I would never go to this hospital again... Suffering pain is difficult, but not as difficult as constantly hearing your staff make comments about my race. Educatd your staff! Teach them what to say what not to say!",1
"I cannot thank the Maxillofacial Team enough following a horse kick fracturing and dislocating my jaw  in 3 places over 6 weeks ago. I was flown in my air ambulance from Lichfield Staffs. You have all been amazing .  Amazing hospital, team, ward staff and admin!!",5
"The nurseries,midwifes and doctors were absolutely brilliant, great and polite communication and very helpful.
So impressed considering other NHS hospitals I've been.",5
7-10 hrs waiting. Flooded with people and understaffed. Indian medical service is soooo far better than this shi ** hole.,1
"The most out date hospital in 21st centre in west. Stay away, come at 21:00 for accient on my knee cap in A&E deparyment and they are not able to see me untill next day 6 in the morning waiting ten hours result rubish system they are having for A&E

Zero star some stuff very very rude talk n dont listen to people who are sick.

Pregnant woman after waiting 3.5 left A&E because of long waiting time.

Make your mind when you advise time is not correct 3 hours to be seen.....!!!!!",1
"My experience today was excellent so efficient and the staff were so friendly, I went to get coffee and the patient had gone for an MRI, a member of staff escorted me to rejoin my family. Nothing was too much trouble, thank you for great service",5
Never had a problem. Had consultations and surgery there myself and my partner had a cesarean section to deliver our child in this hospital and on every occasion everything was handled brilliantly.,5
Cannot fault the Children's Emergency Department. They've looked after me and my boy so many times and are always wonderful. Never been turned away.,5
I went to the Rehab for physio. Small wait as I was early. Physio went well as always. I have the same physiotherapist each time.,5
"I had some treatment today in the max fax department - I was so so nervous, the staff in there were absolutely lovely - so gentle, caring and made me feel very relaxed.
Amazing experience",5
"Went in for a blood test today. The two ladies at the information desk were very uninviting in that I was not welcomed, no verbal introduction and  no smile. Their facial expressions made it seem as though they did not want to help.",1
"Staff neglect patients for hours on end, then threaten to call police on you if you challenge them. Overall the doctors are semi helpful. They definitely need a secret camera in there!",1
"Honestly the worst hospital anyone can go too ! Extremely rude and sarcastic. Asking personal questions witch have nothing to do with reason why we was up there also very intimidating.
Never ever EVER!! Had a experience like it .",1
Took gf to the mdu as she has been severely unwell. Waited 2-3 hours just for her to be told they don't know what's wrong with her but it should go by the weekend. I'm sorry but if you don't know what's wrong with her how do you know it go by the weekend. Oh btw the symptoms haven't gone yet and she didn't even get tested for corona.,2
"Absolutely shocking, if I could give 0 stars then I would have done so. Waiting here for over 5 hours at A&E but not been seen by a doctor . What are they doing inside ???
They bleed to sort their act out 5 hours is not good enough",1
"I apsolutly hate this hospital with a passion. A good proportion of staff are ignorant and rude. Services I appreciate are stretched put ppatient empathy is moderate.

I would rather drop dead than be admitted personally to this hospital.",2
Attended clinic 4 today from the receptionist to the doctor was first class and thank you to the nurse who offered me another seat ( sorry didn’t get your name but the gesture was lovely),5
The doctor that consulted me was extremely racist and rude.sent me home with a bad infection and saying “in uk doesn’t exist poisonous spiders” she was also very keen to know where I work before consulting me and asking again  where I work several times to make me uncomfortable for my work place.,1
Please could you say Thankyou to Mr Patel and his team in Neurosurgery Department and all of the Nursing Staff for Saving my wifes Life. You are all truely amazing.  Regards The Croft Family.,5
I was disgraced when the nurse called the security to take me out of the hospital on visiting my sick daughter only 3 months old and I also suffer from epilepsy. I was pushed by security. . Disgusting act disability discrimination act.,1
Absolutely awful hospital every time I’ve been they either loose notes don’t listen to patients generally rude really bad bedside manners very slow waiting times even for very young children if you can avoid this hospital as an adult or child I’d avoid the place I’d give zero stars if I could,1
Waste of time parking even the poor staff have to pay. Its like they dont care about the patients any more leaving people to struggle. The nhs is a shining  example of how life today is controlled by money men and hse mugs. Everyone scared to move for fear of treading on the next ones toes. Ahhh come the revolution...,1
I had a major operation at this hospital and I was treated with great respect and consideration . I want to thank all the staff for giving me such excellent quality of care I was in ward ten . What angels you all are every one of you . Thanks so much,5
I’m trying to find out which ward my father is in and what’s happening after he was admitted . I’m in Canada so it’s difficult . The switchboard just puts me through to a phone that rings and rings but it never answered. Very upsetting .,1
Just been offered a cup of tea by one of the staff members (Julia) in the Medical Decisions Unit. First time this has happened to me in a hospital and a small gesture that goes a very long way.,5
"Became unwell at work in September 2017 and was looked after incredibly well by the nurses and doctors. Very conscientious, considering the incredible pressure they were under. They saved my life.",5
"Audiology Department.
I have recently had the pleasure of being seen by the Audiology department.
Simran carried out a test and fitted me with two hearing aids and a few weeks later carried out a followup consultation. I was extremely pleased with the carrying out of the test, the fitting of the aids and the cheerful answering of my many questions. She is an excellent, cheerful and very courteous member of staff at Walsgrave.  A credit to the department and Walsgrave.
Yours very gratefully,

"I have repeatly tried to obtain treatment for myself over past 6 weeks with no success. I have rare condition actinmycosis. This is a contagious bacteria disease that progressively destroys tissues of body leaving scar tissue. A person's immune system can not alone fight the infection as bacteria destroys white blood cells rapidly. The bacteria can easily transfer around body from face to legs unlike most bacteria. I have been seen by dermatologist Dr Kahn and A&E dept who both allege my skin condition is due to self harm as I have psychiatric history.

I would strongly recommend anyone with a psychiatric history and physical health problems not to use this hospital. As their physical health problems will be disregarded completely even if GP refers them to hospital for physical health conditions",1
"Don't go here. You will regret it. Just goto George Elliott instead. If you end up here, leave and try to get to George Elliott or Warwick Hospital instead.",1

Genuinely impressed with the level and quality of care received. Clearly short-staffed and run off their feet but everyone took the time to care and give the support and treatment needed.,5
I had 8 fits  in a row small one's again stade in hospital for to weeks  . They saw me having epileptic fits so other doctors and people can get proof. Thanks for your hard work staff in the   hospital.,5

Well done",5
"I was admitted on 8th May to the hospital and then to Ward 23SAU.
The doctors, surgeons were first class.  The senior staff member Karen Heatherington on Ward 23SAU was disrespectful, inefficient and thoroughly unprofessional.",2

"take care about control mind system und voices spread out at the hospytal. They are able to convince you to treat psicotic problem, saying to you that the voices spread out in the different words are in your mind, but They are produced by the system that is in the hospytal wall. Please use legal people in case you live such situations at this hospytal. It is a crime!!!
If you are not sure about your mental situation and you never had this problem before you should ask for a general environment cleaning. There are companies specialyzed in finding microchips system, and all the system that are used to find what produce voices and those are companies that use and sell tools used to find exactly where this system is. In internet you find all the infos!!!
It happens like this: is there somewhere inside the hospytal Walls like a system able to read patients mind, and according to what the system read produce voices that can be heard by people Who work there. And They say what you Think or before asking your questions they give you an answer!
At the same time They convince you about your psycotic problem and force you to take medications. But the voices that you hear are produced by a system that is in the wall (elettricity system or sonething else). Take care, be aware about this situation and use legal support! I would suggest to close definetly this hospytal. In addition I would say that what you hear is also brand image demage (because it happens that They say something strange about companies names) and you can say that psychiatry does not use objective measures to find out problems such as schizofrenia or bipolarism but boths depend on what doctors say. At this case they produce the problem, They convince you about this psicosy (violence psychic) and they think to be able to treat it. If you are not strong enough to react They give you a certificate with all the diagnosys, with stamp about hospytal and doctors names. Dont' loose time to use it to proceed legally because is a good prouve to use as act during a legal procedure 😀🚵🏾🍺🐾",1
cannot praise all the  staff on ward 23  at Walsgrave enough they was so caring and could do enough for me got me sorted and got straight on to the problem fantastic drs and excellent staff even the cleaner was lovely so a big massive thank you for making me feel better 😊 (this is how it should be great credit to all on the ward  forever grateful D checkley,5
"Great place if you need to go to hospital, this one is one of the best I've been to.
All the staff seem to care and take pride in knowing their job makes a huge difference  in someone's life........",5
"Staff hit & miss. Some excellent, some seem grumpy & unhelpful. Parking a rip off. Way too big a place for its own good. Easily ignored & forgotten about. Modern but has its problems. Shops reasonably pricey. Facilities OK.",3

IN ALL MY YEARS OF GOING TO THE HOSPITAL I HAVE HAD SO MUCH CARE AND ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH BY THE DOCCTOR’S & NURSES THEY HAVE GONE AN EXTRA MILE TO HELP ME BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL KEEP UP THE EXTRA CARE YOU DO.,5

"simply the best hospital in the UK ( apart from waiting, but still better than any other). Very clean, great administration, fab staff. Closer to a private hospital than a NHS one.",5
"Waiting 4h 30min, still I hasnt hear  my name. I asked one of staff(she said to wait) I decided to leave…very poor services as (emergency department adult).",1
Horrendous Parking - possibly the worst I've seen in any hospital. The road system outside the hospital is similarly useless. Having one road into biggest hospital in the region (Cov & Warwick) shows some serious incompetence in urban/traffic planning.,2
Have had several dealings over the years and every time mire than happy with the support provided. Staff are dealing with a never ending and seemingly thankless task. Keep up the good work.,5
"When ever I came in A&E ,I have to wait 6 hours minimum .such a pathetic system for who comes in emergency. Never seen such a poor service anywhere in uk and no one is trying to sort it. Found it worse than before each time I came in A&E",1

"My wife has been in and out of the hospital numerous times, trying to get her kidney and bladder sorted, so far they say it's a infection but not said the name of the infection, and get to the point they give her tablets and let her go, she's been in catheter for months, been dealing with this problem for years before covid started and still no results, from Feb 2018 to now def loosing my faith and patience with the NHS",1
"An absolute farce of an establishment. Poor service, horrendous wait times, under resourced and extortionate car park charges. We live in Coventry and travel to Warwick to avoid this place at all costs.",1
"Fabulous work by Mr Tapp and his cardiology team - it was hard to believe my husband had had an operation when I went to pick him up - two great nurses on the day unit too, Jenny and Mikey - thank you",5
Doesn’t free car park must be have free car park facilities. When patients family come to visit them should be better for them on free car park,2
has sadly become a government paid slaughterhouse for the masses but with less compassion,1
"The best hospital. Its worth 7 stars not 5.
Incredible team. Incredible services. I love this hospital it saved me one week ago. Best regards. Respect!",5
Expensive car park.  Dirty A&E department and couldn't be bothered staff. Typical NHS hospital really.,1
This amazing team have helped me more than they will ever know. They're mega understanding and so supportive and uplifting. Im so happy for them to be taking care of my health wouldn't have it any other way now.,5
The doctors I saw were lovely. The nurses are wonderful. One of the receptionist needs re training in x ray department.,4
Having to wait 6hrs for a child with a high temp to be seen is unacceptable shouldn't be accepted as normal practice.,1
Found it difficult to locate the visitors car park plus the expense of parking. Once inside the signposting wasn't brilliant & confusing. Other than that nice clean hospital.,3
"I can not thank uhcw for the kindness caring support they gave me last June when I had my kidney transplant and also again this year when I had my Nephrectomy I was on ward 50 and ECU, my surgeon Mr James Hunter is incredible I am so so lucky to have him, the nurses and HCAs are also incredible, they don't stop giving amazing support and care and they are all in my heart.

I know all hospitals are busy but I’ve been trying to find where my mum is and if she’s ok after having two falls,1
"Disgraceful service when trying to ring up. Sent from pillar to post have been ""waiting"" for half an hour. How difficult is it to type a name into your system and tell me. Yes he will need picking up this evening or no we will need to keep him overnight. Abysmal system unhelpful staff.",1
Thank you to all the nurses and especially the support workers who looked after me last week. Can't Thank you enough.,5
"A&E casualty is diabolical. No movement of booked in patients to see a dr after 4 hrs of waiting. Still waiting to see a Dr !!

To all the hard working people at wallsgrave hospital.when you go threw the door it is a place for hero's. From the chap who cleans the floor to the consultant who see you.thank you all.,5
Absolutely dreadful experience today at eye casualty. Wasted 3.5 hours of my time. Appalling service or should I say no service.  Staff are not trained and not helpful and I will be writing a letter of complaint.,1
Great facilities for patients and ample parking on site at chargeable rates.,5
"I went to university hospital today with my parents to out patients, as my dad is going to have a heart bypass operation, what a good idea to have all your tests on the same day, meeting with the surgeon who is doing the operation, then up to the ward where he will be when he has the operation met the senior nurse, myself and my parents were well impressed at how organised the hospital is, my dad  feels so much better for the visit and puts his mind at ease in preparation for his operation, can honestly say this is a hospital that has well impressed me and my parents good organisation cannot praise it enough, only Moan I would have is queuing for parking but other than that length of time there parking was reasonable.",5
Don’t trust dr or nurses they are not a dr they are cheaters I request to all family members and friends don’t trust this hospital,1

"I got there early for my appointment but still had to wait to be seen, the staff are helpful and friendly but it is not like an English hospital most of the nurses and doctors are from abroad where the qualifications are just not up to British standard, some of the staff can be very rude when asked questions which isn't nice when you are left waiting,",3
Excellent service! Edward showed enormous patience and was very comforting. 9 people involved and all very efficient. NHS at its best.,5
"Hell on earth, Car park and access is designed to be as confusing as possible.
If you want a good laugh try ringing them. If you do get them the staff are unhelpful and offish.",1
I have had surgery and was given a nurses contact number to call if I had any issues post surgery. No one ever picks up the call and didn’t call back after leaving a voicemail. Very disappointed.,1
It's a good hospital but there simply isn't enough parking spaces which causes regular chaos.  A large multi storey car park is surely the only solution.,3

"Having been taken by Ambulance to Walsgrave(my choic) I have nothing but praise for A and E and the Cardiology Ward.Everywhere I went was spotlessly clean,staff were kind and very efficient and the Cath Lab for Angioplasty was again clean and very pleasant staff-the only conversation I had with a doctor was through the persepex screen after the Angioplasty where I was told'You are on Ticagrelor for a year -take it morning and night-don't forget'.However,having found out 6 weeks after the procedure that I will not be having a 'check up' I am not so impressed!I have several issues with the medication that was prescribed without discussion with myself and must now take a longer appointment with my Gp to discuss these problems.11 years ago I had a stent inserted -after initially being admitted to the George Elliot and was taken a day later to Walsgrave for Angio-but on return to the Elliot it was fully explained what had been done and the meds I was being prescribed and I then had the Cardio rehab tram call me a few days later at home and had a check up!When did it all change??",3
"Having just spent 6 days on ward 22 short stay, I would like to say a big thankyou to ALL the staff from cleaners to consultants x",5
The most rubbish hospital i have ever been to leaving little babies n children to sit in a waiting room packed full of people for over 8 hour's number's of children to be seen by doctor going up no number's going down but the time of waiting to see someone creeping up. ALSO VERY RUDE STAFF 😠😠,1
Very efficient service.This place saved my life.heart bypass.,5

Nurses and staff are brilliant. Have been to the hospital every day for the last two months and every day I was treated with respect and dignity,5
"EXCELLENT CARE AND CONSIDERATION FROM THE WARD STAFF EVEN IF THEY PUT THE PHONE DOWN ON YOU SOMETIMES , AND FORGET TO DO SOMETHING YOU HAVE ASKED FOR.

"Arrived at A&E yesterday only to be told it's closed, I had to get another taxi and go to St Cross in Rugby, after checking their website and calling beforehand,  they need to get their information updated,  as I don't drive it was a very expensive trip.",2
Had a biopsy in the breast clinic. Marvelous Dr and nurses. Really put me at my ease,5
"son has been in an accident and the hospital did everything to help as he was 100 miles from his home.   allowed him to telephone and did all they could to help him.   cannot fault the service

"I had an appointment at the dentist on Tuesday and my wisdom tooth hurt, but it didn't. He asked me if it hurt, he looked in my mouth to see how many masses I have to remove or to remove the nerve, he didn't do anything to me, I've had a toothache for almost a week and I'm scheduled to remove 14 masses in May, I'm scheduled to remove as many masses scheduled in May as in a year and a half, the system is running slowly",1
"you have a lot of bad reviews, but you don't take any action about it... you wait 6 hours for a doctor to see you... it takes like a day shift. you want patience from the parents, but with sick children in their arms I don't know how much patience they could have. maybe change your system and move a little faster, because I don't think anyone comes to the hospital because they have nothing to do at home..",1
Waiting too long looks like they don't care about people,1
"Very bad care, they left me waiting two days without eating for a scan they had to do, and they didn't know whether to have surgery or not. Then they have me waiting for an ultrasound that in the end was not performed. Some tell me one thing and others something else.
They tell me: you can go home and you can eat, then they say: you can't eat at the end if we do the ultrasound. Then they say in the end we won't do the ultrasound, you will be scheduled for another day and it is not known when we will discharge you. In other words, they have me without eating for almost 24 hours, after the other days without eating. There is no communication between nurses and doctors. It's a mess and they don't tell you things clearly. A very bad experience. All I can say is that the staff is friendly and that's it. There is nothing more to say well.",1
"Good morning
Can anyone help my husband with a phone charger as he is admitted to the Psychiatric Department of the hospital, they don't help him there, I can't help him

"I was referred to the maternity dept for my first baby, I saw two male drs at my first appointment who were completely and utterly rude! Made me feel like my feels weren’t valid, never introduced themselves, told me I was making things up about previously health conditions, making sarcastic faces to my partner and rolling their eyes with me and spoke to me in a very poor tone when I was at a low point and made me cry. Moving hospitals to have my baby elsewhere since this visit",1
"Can't fault anything at nx,2xheart attack, kidney removed, bladder cancer and prostrate cancer. All ways looked after me ,keeping me going.",5
"Shannon in out patients is an absolute Star. If there's an employee of the month she deserves it,  and if not she should get something.  An absolute saint and angel.  Doctor was late and her compassion and kindness was second to none.  She needs recognizing and promoting.  Thank you x Stuart.",5
"Hate this place so much - waiting list over a year for my heart almost a year for stomach.  MRI waiting area was two chairs in the car park in a cold wet day - doors behind us to a corridor were locked.  They’ve had my results since November 2023, I’ve chased them multiple times for the scan I had we are now in January 2024 and still I haven’t had the results.  “Waiting to be signed”. Many many more things plus the way my elderly father was treated in A&E is putrid and disgusting.  I’m in the process of transferring all appointments away from that place.  It’s a horrible horrible place.",1
Ì had to attend op dept today and can honestly say I received really good care. From the kind lady who took the time to show me where I needed to be to all the nurses and doctors I came into contact with. They put me at ease and reassured me with kindness and efficiency. Thank you A27 staff and radiology staff.,5
"Currently, there is a lot of building work at the hospital near the entrance which has taken one of the parking areas out completely this has resulted in the parking which was limited before now even worse this has caused cars to be parked all over the grounds including the grass areas.
So plan your trips and allow plenty of time to find parking or use buses or taxis whichever would work out cheaper in the long run.

I have found the staff to be great and yes appointments do overrun never on time which is normal nowadays but don't be late as they will cancel your appointment on the spot and it is not easy to get them in the first place.

I will add photos later",4
I attended A31 urology outpatients on December 11th for a cystoscopy and kidney stent removal. All staff I met were kind and caring and explained everything to me. Thank you to the nurses and doctors involved in my care on this occasion.,5
"I was admitted on Sept. 7th for a hernia repair. The whole process couldn’t have gone any better. The level of care and support that I received was excellent; everyone on ward A9 were so attentive and professional, thanks JD and your colleagues. I received a spinal injection and my anaesthetist explained the procedure really thoroughly. All of the theatre staff were so calm and reassured me constantly during the op. Big thanks to Doctor Pereira and his team. Terrific care and when you are poorly it’s the best place to be. Yes, there will always be delays but that is only because there are much more serious cases in front of you with people whose situation is far worse than yours. Great job everyone and thank you.
Alex",5
"If I could give 0 stars I would.
I fully appreciate the NHS is at full capacity but to be left waiting with my 8 month old baby in a waiting room for 9 hours whilst they knew her temp was 39-40 is disgusting.
I got sent to the wrong place and then put to the back of the que all over again due to no fault of my own, one nurse said they would do blood tests, another said they weren’t concerned enough to do any.
Got to 1am and we had been left in a room with no idea what was going on so I said I was discharging us, they weren’t bothered at all and the nurse said I would get seen quicker by waiting till the morning to ring the GP!",1
"Sadly my mom passed away on 29.11.23 in Acute A & E..words cannot the pain I feel but the care especially by Lee who was on duty that morning. Lee did his upmost to make me feel supported. He did everything possible did me handprints of mom's hands and a heart which I've put in a frame. Judith also who cared for mom throughout the night thought she was very hard and no caring skills whatsoever. It was a job to her and I couldn't connect with her. All I got through the night I'm so tired, it was a choar to her and I didn't want to leave mom while Judith was on duty.  Stacey in the beaverment centre I cannot fault. Nurse in a million...I did see mom in the mortuary and Stacey did everything to make my experience calmly. Did handprints and sent them through the post. Nothing to much trouble.......From positive to negative A & E before mom was moved to Acute ward well what an experience!!!!!!!!! The nurse on duty was absolutely diabolical...tried to feed mom when she was totally out of it.. I witnessed this and was mortified...trained nurses who have no idea...I could have done this better myself.",2
"I dislocated and fractured my ankle, and the emergency treatment was good. But after that, the organisation is shambolic. The right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing, the toilets were filthy and there can be a lack of consistency of advice from the medical profession.",1
"A&E & Urgent Care have the worst systems & services, save your day & do not visit there, you will experience ridiculous waiting times going back & forth for tests and having to be triaged repeatedly. Poor patient care & compassion, for being such a large hospital the amount of staff are not swift enough to look after patients well.",1
Worst experience. My new born baby wasn't well and my wife had stitches during delivery. She was unable to sit on chair due to her stitches and was unable to feed baby. I asked the staff for any comfortable place where  my wife could sit and feed the baby as wel but staff didn't help us in any way. We were here by 10.30pm waited for the doctor but nobody help us..,1
"Good hospital friendly staff, car parks can be extremely busy.",4
"I recently took my daughter in with a ‘quinsey’. The staff were all extremely helpful, from the car park attendant to every nurse, consultants and all in between went over and beyond to make her comfortable and reassured in a very scary situation. I would specifically mention the ENT ward B7, they were all amazing!! thank you!!",5
"Unfortunately 3 of my family members have needed to use A&E this year and every single time has been appalling. My 10yo niece passed out randomly, an ambulance blue lighted her to A&E and she was not seen by a doctor for 9 HOURS. My dad received a blow to the head and he was unresponsive, unable to move, talk or walk for an hour, he was given a CT scan within 2 hours but had to wait 8 HOURS to hear the results. My Auntie was having a number of serious medical issues and her doctor told her to go to A&E and be hospitalised. She wasn’t seen for 9 HOURS and they sent her home, months later we find out she has a brain tumour. People are going to die because they are not receiving the care they need quickly enough. On all 3 occasions the A&E department was quiet so it is clear they have cut staff hours to save money at the cost of the public’s health. Absolutely ludicrous and appalling.",1
"My brother got admitted to the hospital. He walked in by himself but ended up just lying in bed the next day. The doctors seemed unsure about how to help him, and we were upset, but they seemed more interested in talking than treating him. After a day, he didn't recognize us, and we became worried. We had to push them to take action, even though he's only 20. The doctors and nurses didn't seem to care. finally made the ICCU nurses check on him and move him to the ICCU. If they had cared more, this wouldn't have happened. We've been in the hospital for four months now and had to move to Birmingham because the doctors at New Cross couldn't figure out what was wrong. It's the worst experience I've ever had.",1
Would not recommend coming here for a&e you can’t take any relatives in with you not even one! I get due to how busy it is but when ur in pain is an absolute joke get told by triage you can and then at urgent care the man was so rude not just to us but to others as well and most people in the waiting room had other people more than just one relative with them but yet we wasn’t. So we went to Walsall mannor cuz they are 100x better.,1
"I really do not reccomend this hospital, as I had to wait 7
hours to get eye care because my eye got hurt and with many other people who also waited tho same time or more time than me. I had to wait until 1AM but still I didn't get my treatment, so I decided to go home and wait until the other day to get to another hospital, which served me in about half an hour. I really do not reccomend this hospital and if you really need treatment I would definetely not prefer to wait this long to get treatment. Therefore, I give it a one star rating.",1
"Awful!!!! Clueless, rude, don't care, don't listen... 7hrs wasted in there for something they could have said at the start. With a toddler who's not even 2! Did not need that! Useless hospital! Stay away from the Urgent Treatment Centre!",1
5 Stars for the reception staff and Doctors at A&E who were excellent with my farther who has a diagnosis of Vascular Dementia. 0 for the staff who ignored the trust's own guidance on Dementia  patients that's very clearly printed on walls on virtually every corridor.,5
Well what can I say this place  doesn't  even deserve  a 1 star  my 18 year old.special needs daughter  had to go.to ae yesterday  due to having  fits now I'm her pointe  which I do.all.the care stuff for her but to be told I'm not allowed  in with her she has to go in on her own and not to mention  nobody apart from patient  was allowed  to sit on the chairs  it's totally  utterly  disgusting   me and my 12 year old daughter  was sitting  on the floor  the staff are so rude   in my opinion  worst hospital,1
"I have a parking complaint. While visiting the hospital frequently over the last few months I have observed, mainly on P6 car park that getting a car park space is extremely difficult. Partly because of the amount of staff cars parked on there. I understand the issues staff face but patients are only in a space for a short space of time, but staff can be there 12/13 hours. Staff should have designated parking",2
"The parking recently is ridiculous, I spent that long driving round the hospital grounds trying to find a car space that I missed my appointment - I was there 15 minutes before my appointment. Everyone is parking on the grass verges, yellow lines and it’s interrupting being able to drive round the hospital in general.",2
"Why are people allowed to smoke at the entrance of the A&E? Signpost everywhere saying smoke free hospital? Clearly not  “The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust (RWT) is officially smoke free for staff, patients and visitors. This came into effect as of 1 October 2020.” Well well we are now in 2023.",1
"Took my mom for surgery and was asked to get her there for 7am, which I did. Waited several hours for news. I phoned several times and was 16th in the queue and then call was dropped twice before getting through. Eventually got through at about 5pm and was told she had only gone through to surgery at 4.30pm. Was told to phone back in an hour and then was told to pick her up at 7.15pm, a full 12 hours since I dropped her off!
Well my mother is 88 and I really wasn’t happy and gave the nurse At reception some feedback. She agreed it was a crazy system, my mother could easily have been dropped off in the afternoon. This is just poor organisation! Surgery went OK but when I took mum to have stitches out a week later at 2.30pm there really was no parking and it was a nightmare afternoon, I dropped my mother off at the hospital entrance. By the time I had parked off-site my mother had tried to find her way to A25 area and I couldn’t find her. Eventually I ascertained she had checked in herself. Not an afternoon I’d like to repeat. I blame years of Conservative leadership for running down our NHS!",2
"SDEC - Same Day Emergency Care ? Absolutely shocking ! 7.5hrs waiting with an 84yr old man with severe abdominal pain & sickness - I was that disgusted, I brought him home without even seeing a doctor ! 😡",1
"Cannot complain about anything wonderfully staff true u do have to wait. But they're not just dealing with you...
Only issue is getting though phoning is a nightmare As for A&E
I'm not surprised I've never seen one department so busy",4
My son was transfered here from Telford at 1 day old to the NICU. The staff really took care of him greatly and we are so thankful they were able to offer him a bed to get the treatment he needed.,4
Abosolute worst hospital in the westmidlands I’ve been nothing.  But gaslighted to stay for near enough 4days bedbound put on mealtomouth 3times constantly drugged up with paracetamols and god knows what and all they have to deal with me is cut and clean a wound I have from the first day I got here they told me will be seen in the morning that morning turned to the whole day on meal to mouth until they told me at 7oclock it doesn’t matter now I can eat they’ll look at me tomorrow and all that’s happened is the same cycle of the first day I got here and then the whole time I’ve had other people in my room constantly complaining because there goin through a similar situation because nobody’s doing there job except the poor nurses that have to deal with the backlash   that’s got nothin to do with them cuz they only doin what they can it’s the actual doctors that are doing absolute nothing except one job then doin watever they want rest of the day worst hospital I feel terrible for anybody that ends up in there,1
Diabolical service levels - people are waiting over 3 hours to see triage nurse. Such a shameful experience and so many lives being risked.,1
"You will need their mental heath services after trying to park a car there.
I know I should use this to cover the health care, but the people in charge of site management and car parking must be blind and stupid to do such a bad job. Even new parking cameras and signs has made it worse !.
The health care is, I'm sure,  on a par with the rest of the NHS, but the site management has to be the worst in the country.",1
I went here today with suspected pneumonia. I cannot thank all the staff enough for being kind and sorting my efficiently. Even gave me a hot chocolate and some toast.,5
"The nurses, doctors and staff who looked after my beautiful Mother are wondeful people. A hospital full of caring people. Thank you",5
"I am still in after awk. Lots of tests. I had to tell already took done? Then ECGs eregular, but left? Would them to send me to a ward that can help, or I'm be going home the same I came in. Staff are like robots. No names no manners lack of communication. All week could not get met medical supplies. Finally sorted it out myself after 4 pharmacy staff, sister & Matron came to see me. Then weekend all changed. Given my own to take but still can't get controlled drug when required every 4 hrs ? Nurse just checked I taken my medication? Given 2 chewy Calcium chewy tablets ? Don't know why they were prescribed?Called an old woman by consultant? Told him I'm the youngest on the ward at 56. He avoids me now & sends his junior. He's no better. Told him to go away when he did not want to listen to me. There are too many wrong things 2 mention. I have asked if this is a prison or hospital?? Iam a patient get me out of here?",1
"Although several A&E staff basically called me a liar when I had gallstones and a distended gall bladder, I am thankful to the Dr that pushed for me to be moved to a ward. Once admitted, my consultant Mr Pereira, was absolutely fantastic, have never met a more amazing doctor. He looked after me, did my operation and called after discharge to check on how I was doing. He definitely went above and beyond and I will be forever grateful to him and will never forget him, he pretty much single handedly saved my life.
Never had any problems with the eye department",5
"My husband very recently had a heart bypass at this hospital and we can thank the staff enough, couldn’t fault anything, from theatre to itu to the ward not only doctors and nurses through the whole process but also domestic staff and porters! Even staff in the shop.
Thank you",5
"I cannot praise enough all of the staff at this hospital. From restaurant staff, nurses, care assistants, doctors and consultants. All so very friendly, welcoming and basically earth angels! The care was outstanding for my 6 year old daughter over 3 days. Thank you so much for being so thorough. We are very grateful! Anna 🙏🏼

PS The parking on the other hand is an absolute nightmare. They need 2-3 story. Luckily there is a car park opposite and very near (walking distance) for £3 per day. 👍🏼🙏🏼👍🏼",5
"I went to hospital by taxi even though I was suffering with short of breath. My BP was 58  and oxygen level was 92 as I came to know later by my report.
I still had to wait more than 3 hours there to see a doctor. As I had 3 puffs before I went there so it was temporary help for me to at least safely reach to hospital by taxi,  the nurse sent me to urgent care unit and they told me it is 6-7 hours waiting time. I saw the nurse again and told her I have chest tightness and not feeling very well. She was very rude and said you can talk and walk properly so it's not emergency. I went to Pheonix walk-in center few days before and they gave me treatment straightway .
Also last year in Isleworth London I was treated well with the same condition.
But I was disappointed in this hospital and maybe it's not all their fault as they having short of staff and doctors.",2
"Seem organised. Also very, very busy. Patients called into many different construction rooms. Rather like a conveyor belt. The medical care was excellent, but the whole experience was not good.
Some sort of feedback from pleasant staff. Would have made for a better experience.",4
"A&E waiting times are ridiculous, when you do get to see a nurse she just puts you in another waiting area to see yet another nurse.  Had to leave my 21yr old daughter in waiting area as only two people allowed through and she was harassed by a man and asked a lady if she could sit with her as she felt unsafe!  The hospital is dirty, there was one nice nurse the rest were stone faced!!  When we finally got away the car parking machines were broke at half three in the morning bloody brilliant, avoid this **** hole at all cost!!!",1
Worst hospital I have ever been to!! The nurses on the wards are rude and consultant walked out when dealing my family member as they didn’t care and had no time for them. They aren’t quick enough with treating serious illnesses such as cancer and sepsis and showed no compassion.,1
"This hospital is NOT disabled friendly they do toilets & thatis it
I had an outpatients appointment last week & because I have limited mobility I could not b examined as they had no way of transfering 2 the bed its appauling",1
"The receptionist has disgusting manners!! Listening to music in her ears, abrupt and not friendly at all. I would understand if she was snowed under, but there was 4 waiting to be seen and she was acting as if someone was giving her a load of multitasking! She was mega rude to an elderly woman born in 1923, which is just awful manners!",1
"Currently sitting in the waiting room at A&E. My mom was brought in by ambulance 3 hours ago. She hasn't seen a doctor yet and we haven't seen her since arrival. She's 80 years old, unwell and in a lot of pain. She's most likely quite distressed as are we her  family. We have no idea how she is and cannot go to her, this is actually barbaric and cannot be good for the patients.",1
They move you from one waiting room to another waiting room to manipulate wait times. It seems like they have more waiting rooms then wards over 7 hour wait after arriving in an ambulance. Understaffed only 5 people in the wait room but took over 7 hours to be seen.,1
"Excellent care shown to my husband, from cardiology outpatients and Louise in cardiology pre assessment,  surgical Co ordinator Emma. All staff on Wards ICCU and B8,and the lovely welcome from ward clerk on B8 Surinder, to have a lovely friendly welcome makes stay in anxious times so much more reassuring.  Cannot fault any of the care shown to my husband, be very proud of yourselves.",5
i had nearly died when i was two but they helped me and im strong and healthy now so thanks workers at new cross hospital,5
"I'm basing this review on the experiences I had with my mum who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. My mum, beautiful, kind, caring, creative and hard-working passed away in November 2022. My mum always went above and beyond for the people she looked after in her job as a social care worker, but sadly she did not always get that same kind of care and attention. First, the surgeon who gave my mum a stomach bypass was amazing. The palliative care doctor who gave my mum relief from terrible pain was also amazing, and most of the nurses/care staff on ward C24 were great as well.

My mum was left in a lot of pain in C16 because a male nurse with a terrible attitude couldn't be bothered to administer her pain relief despite it being overdue. Patients are not an irritant or an inconvenience. They are vulnerable and in need and cancer pain in particular can be very intense.

In my experience, the best, most efficient and most compassionate wards were C24 and A8. A8 still had its faults, but there were some good staff there.
The acute medical unit (C58) seems to function well.
The worst ward, in my experience, was C16.

I cannot give 5 stars because of the times I recall my mum curled up on the hospital bed in agony or crying from distress and nurses not giving a damn. Those memories will haunt me thanks to the terrible staff. How do you think you would cope with a strenuous and heart-breaking journey fighting cancer?

A&E must start to prioritise people with cancer. A cancer patient shouldn't be waiting for hours in A&E while people with strains or other mild injuries get seen first.

I want to thank the amazing surgeons that do life-saving surgery, the compassionate nurses who truly care, and the Palliative Care team. They all deserve 5 stars and they are the ones who still give me some hope.",3
"Busy but staff are very good. Parking is a nightmare and can be very expensive if you don't know how long you are going  to be. If visiting relatives most wards now have a booking system which you have to contact between 10am and 1pm to arrange a visit that day. Harder to visit but wards don't have loads of people in them like they used to as visiting is limited to 2 people In most cases, this is much better for other patients on the wards.",4
"I’m shocked and utterly lost for words !
I was involved in a violent attack which led to a car crash ! I was the passenger and also 3 months into my pregnancy for the 2 hours I waited for the ambulance to check me over I decided to leave the ambulance and go into the hospital the next day around 7am I needed to check if my baby was good due to bleeding
They kept me there for 6 hours and not once did they do a scan not once did they feel my belly and not once did they offer me any advice or additional help they told me to leave and come back in a few days???

Now I’ve lost my baby and it could of been prevented if they did what I asked",1
"Poorly organised , appointments keep getting cancelled by them ; parking is terrible , so bad now cars just park on double yellows and the grass verges all along the front anyway as you’ll miss your appointment if you wait for a space . Receptionist Staff aren’t friendly and are not helpful really at all . Needs a lot of sorting out",1
"I haven't had a good experience. I was admitted to A&E for a migraine with vomiting, slurred speech and loss of movement, I thought I was having a stroke but it (luckily?) turned out to be hemiplegic migraine. I had to wait 9 hours to be seen, 12 hours before I was given anti-sickness and pain relief medication. I couldn't talk or hear because of really loud tinnitus, I tried asking for pen and paper to explain and was ignored by several nurses. Refused to take their masks off or wear clear ones so I could read their lips so I couldn't understand anything they were asking or was said around me. I was put in a wheelchair despite having passed out once in the waiting room and left on my own, I couldn't sit properly and I kept feeling I was sliding off and about to pass out and no one would help me. I was on my period and I was left to sit in my own pooling blood for 6 hours before they finally let my partner in so he could assist me to clean myself.
Horrible uncaring staff, sneering and making fun of you instead of showing genuine concern and care. Worst experience I've had so far and I'm genuinely disgusted with the attitude and lack of professionalism of the NHS staff.",1
"Had to visit A&E yesterday afternoon to get something checked. I was seen by a triage nurse, had observations taken and directed to 'Same Day Emergency Care' all in the space of about 20 minutes. Very impressed. I did have a 90 minute wait at SDEC however this could have been a lot longer. I was assessed by a lovely doctor and given some pain relief. I needed some minor surgery. As I was in a lot of pain she allowed me to come back this morning. When I arrived this morning at the Surgical Assessment Unit (A9) I was seen straight away by a nurse and surgeon who planned to give me general anesthetic. I asked not to have general as I wanted to get it over with and recover at home). They accommodated this and gave me local anesthetic instead. The procedure was done swiftly and after a half an hour rest me and my partner were bought tea and toast. I wasn't rushed to leave. Everyone had a sense of humour which really helps. I was discharged about 10:00 so overall I was in and out in 2 hours. Really happy with everything and all the staff - love our NHS heros.",5
"I recently had cause to ring New Cross Hospital to cancel a couple of appointments for my brother who died suddenly just after Christmas.

I must say what a pleasure it was to speak to human beings on the Switchboard. The two ladies I spoke to were so helpful and sympathetic and I can’t thank them enough for their help, understanding and the professional way that they handled my calls. Thank you very much Switchboard ladies - you made my sad task a whole lot easier.",5
I am autistic with higher support needs who needs someone to sit with them I had worsening pneumonia with asthma and in a lot of pain  and was going to the urgent treatment centre who told us to go to A&E. It was busy and name was called in 5-10 minutes. My heart was working to hard and I had a lovely nurse who reasurred me while having a cannula for the first time and talking about how it worked because I like learning about that. I went on a trolley into Majors I had my own room not a cubicle which helped me be calm and there was no prompting or asking for it. It was 3am and they turned the light off and let closed the door so we could sleep. I have felt so looked after the xray people were lovely too and I'm now resting at home thank you for looking after me!,5
"0 star
Very disrespectful staff Worst service ever had yesterday I’m pregnant went there and I had abdominal pain but no one shows concern  they said they are really busy but after that I had accessive bleeding  and my baby come out  only because of nhs worse service I had lost my baby
I think it's worse service all over the world they don’t care about patient .",1
Had a terrible experience here for my son's birth in 2015. Was left and ignored after a C-section and had less than desirable  post natal experience as my son was in for 4 weeks as he was premmie. Having my 2nd now and wish they could be born in the same hospital but there's no way I'm going back.,1
Can not praise the paediatric staff the security staff and the student nurses who Assisted with my severely  autistic daughter. They couldn’t help enough with anything we both needed the support was beyond what i expected. The young student nurse who accompanied me and my daughter the entire visit as good as was amazing with my daughter her knowledge of Autisum was very good and helped with the time we were there. The security were also very accepting of my daughter behaviours just can no praise tbh is hospital enough!,5
14 hours to see a doctor after family member arrived in an ambulance. Very clever how they move patients from one waiting room to another so they can manipulate waiting times. Without doubt in my 55 years on this planet have I ever seen such a shambolic poorly staffed and run A&E. Hospital management are a bloody disgrace!!!,1
"My husband was recently admitted to A/E with breathing difficulties. Paramedics and staff in A/E were exemplary as was the rest of his care whilst an in patient. He spent a short time on AMU and then transferred to C26. Everyone without exception was kind, caring and compassionate. You are all stars, thank you. The hospital was spotlessly  clean and he enjoyed the food....he is a fussy eater.
A courier delivered some missing medication within an hour of arriving home. Again thank you all.
The only disappointment was a receptionist when trying to book a visit to see him. She was rude and unhelpful, perhaps some customer relation trying is needed.",4
"I would like to share that my brother had an bad experience at the A&E, as he was told to go here from the private doctor in Nuffield. He was waiting for a long time for someone to see him since 7pm. However, I understand plenty of patients are there but it's very silly for them to treat a patient like that. Moreover, they took him upstair for a blood test and etc three times to see if his calcium had improved. Furthermore, I am told he still waiting to be discharged and it's almost 02:18 in the morning. Finally, they would not let my parents or sister sit with him untill 1 something in the morning. He was treated unfairly and was very upsetting.

No refreshments given and not allowed to sit with my brother for blood test and Not provided on time.

Even though the reception tried to help, the doctors and etc are less and need a massive improvement.",2
"Waited in A&E for about thirty minutes which I think is quite good considering I wasn't near death. The staff were very nice and I could have a good laugh with them which I think is key. They looked after me very well and they showed that they knew exactly what they were doing. However, the sandwiches in A&E were slightly poor. But I have very high standards on sandwiches. Very high. Thank you for sorting me out.",5
"My mom ( who is 92 with dementia) has to attend new cross eye hospital regularly, I can honestly say the staff at the eye hospital department are amazing. Nothing is too much trouble and they go over and above normal duties to ensure the patients are made comfortable and understand the procedures. I just want to say a big thank you to all the staff who were so kind to mom and I today.",5
"I went into New Cross to have a Pacemaker fitted Ward B14 and B15. I found all of the staff nurses,doctors,nursing support staff and cleaning staff very friendly and helpful. Nothing was to much trouble. They made me feel comfortable although I was nervous, this being only my second night in any hospital in my 77 years. My treatment by them was first class. They all conduct themselves in the friendly professional manner. They explained everything that was going to happen during my procedure and after care. Hospital food I have heard horror stories about this. I must say . It was not Five Star quality but I looked at it. Like this . One had at least three choices for each meal. There was in my opinion enough to meet most peoples requirements. It looked good and appetising. I would class it better than most school dinners. Enough to eat. It was warm and tasty. I look at it. The catering staff worked wonders with the number of staff and budget restrictions.
Thanks to all of the staff for looking after me

"I took my old man in for an x-ray advised by his gp me and my father who has demeanour and bedouin uses a wheelchair arrived at a&e at 2 pm after waiting an hour in reception we was called. I thought not too badly. HA your joking we were called to a corridor with 9 other people to have vitals taken sent to a consultant to start the ball rolling for x-ray x-ray done sent for egc had that done sent back to waiting room it was 2200 hours I asked reception what now can we go do you send x-ray to gp oh no she said if you walk out of the hospital he will be discharged I said OK what now we had to see a doctor at the hospital I said we he's had nothing proper to eat he's been in the wheelchair 8 hours she said abruptly like I said he will be discharged so OK up we went to sit in another waiting room for another 3 hours to be spoken by some snotty nose nurse who for some reason don't enjoy her job no more for explaining about my dad getting a bit agitated for the time being there.  She put a bad atmosphere in the waiting room because of who all hurd her. we eventually, after 2 and half hours more, walked out of there at 1530. We only went for an x-ray",1
"The lady at reception was very rude, very snappy to customers asking simple questions. If you can’t work in a respectful manner don’t work in a reception desk.",1
"I recently had a replacement pacemaker procedure at Newcross Hospital. The care I received was second to none in the Cardiac day ward. Standard of hygiene, cheerful efficient staff & level of care, were excellent from the surgeon down. I was kept well informed at all times.
Well done team. Highly commend them all.",5
Yesterday on 23 December 2023 been to same day care wait for more then 7 hours in total kidney stones pain they lost my urine and ask for new one only two doctors working on the day and the nurses and helping staff came like army officer and sit down on chair never get up for hours and only looking the computer only get up when they need the toilet officials need to undercover inspection public is suffering,1
"Staff at the reception for Urgent Care Centre are the most rudest staff I have ever come across. One of them was a woman named Trish the other was a younger woman, not sure of her name..absolutely terrible attitude. An appointment was cancelled for a baby without being notified even though it was to be prioritised for Urgent Care due to worsening condition. Very poor and an absolute disgrace",1
Honestly having being with the manor and being transferred to new cross I haven’t been disappointed or felt worried about my care at all. all staff are highly trained and know what there talking about whereas manor has so many staff and trainees you feel confused to what’s happening also I’m amazed by how quick the waiting times are compared you can tell the hospital is ran properly and staff are happy to be there where as manor it’s rude slow and most time cannot understand consultants I have asked my midwife to refer me to new cross from now on and will never go back to the manor Thankyou so much to everyone who has treated me I feel 100% better compared to manor. They found that I had an infection whereas manor have taken bloods and not noticed ! New cross are so thorough I’d recommend them to everyone ! Thankyou so much again ❤️,5
"I gave  two stars because the receptionist was polite and lovely.

After being told 7+  hours before ambulance to turn up ,we had to make our way with what little money we had,  possible cardiac arrest waits for no one!

Told there is wait 1-1/2+ ok waited 3 and nothing I asked again another 1-1/2 hour ? Ended up leaving, my partner still has chest pain plus shoulder, but has eased off till the next time who knows?

I can understand the pressure , of shortage of staff, lack of pay also stress that come with the Job however if a patient / patients present them self with all the symptoms of a suspected heart attack with a positive family history  at least do a the basic observations within the first hour ,

A and E New cross need a different strategies or other interventions of how to handles theses situations, a person should not have to wait until they are practically dead! Or unable to function causing further health incomplications!

Scary times!",2
"Just wanted to say a big thank you for a life saving operation. I had an emergency C-section and was unable to give birth. Managed to deliver my daughter just in time, before we both had a heart attack. Cleared her airway and handed her to me. Gave us plenty of time to rest and recover. Now she's a happy healthy (and very chatty) 10 year old. I'd also like to add that the food was delicious.",5
"My daughter was very poorly, in A+E they rushed her straight through, can’t fault them. We were then transferred to the children’s ward and after a few nights sent home with a canalur in her hand to return every evening for medication whilst waiting on test results. We were told these results would take 2 days but 7 days in and still no results! So she is currently being treated for something she may not have! I can’t fault the nurses on the children’s ward but the doctors keep us waiting for hours and hours. Very frustrating and very expensive in parking costs.",3
"Lack of care. Lack of sympathy to poorly children waiting to be seen in A&E. Rude staff. Absolutely disgustingly appalling waiting times, 9 hours to been seen in A&E. Ended up walking out! Main receptionist in A&E lovely girl, and welcoming. When transferred to wait in urgent care, all rude, no care in the world considering there job. A response of ""what do you expect with free NHS"" well it's not free we pay tax for it and should still get good care given!!!! Would rather go to another hospital next time.",1
"Took my mom to A&E as she was having pain in her chest, shoulders and left arm and was told by receptionist that it’s 11 hours wait to see a doctor. We sat thinking they might prioritise us thinking as mom has heart issues and was having chest pain but no receptionist was quite straight forward and told us it’s 11 hours no matter what. While in A&E my mom started feeling more sick and I asked receptionist if atleast someone can do my moms observations as she was getting worse, she very bluntly said it will be 3 hours waiting time for my mom to be checked by the nurse and to do her observations. So dont expect any empathy or sympathy from the staff",1
"I have been here 12 and a half hours and still have not been told what is a matter with me 😩 it’s a joke😒 worst hospital I’ve ever been too , you get told it will be about another hour and you wait another 6",1
Advised to attend A&E with my 6 month old baby who has a cough and mottling of her skin. Seen by triage nurse in A&E who sent us upto the Urgent care unit. We were told there was a 7 hour wait! How is it even reasonable to expect a mum and 6 month old to wait 7 hours to see a GP!,1
"The care from the nursing staff & attention to detail & easily understood explanations from the doctors & surgeons.

Best hospital I've been in (even though I was in an insane amount of pain), and I've been in a few.

Shout out to the Ward B8 nursing staff. 👏 👏",5
"My mom left in a wet bed because no one helped her to the bathroom or placed her on a bedpan. Claim is they are so short staffed. My mons skin is red and breaking down, fortunately or (unfortunately)  my sister is there to observe this. It took them an hour and a half to come to change her. Then the Drs are rushing to have the DNR paper signed without even telling the family why? Care by nurses and Drs is very inadequate and careless at best. Such a shame to what healthcare has now been reduced to. at this hospital.",1
Named worst Hospital 2019. 500 hundred misdiagnosed Deaths operated on wrong body parts. Reported E&S paper. 5 years later still say good morning to my Wife after her death. Keep you on Drugs and then it`s to late .Don`t trust anyone comes to families health. Find a specialist. Not here..Do your own research it`s your family member. They really don`t care. minus but have give one star.,1
"Potentially the worse hospital I have ever to I sat in SDEC and fully miscarriaged and I wasn’t even offered no pain relief ,no sanitary towel was offered after waiting 8 hours I went home without seeing a doctor.

The nurses here are rude and have no empathy whatsoever come
To this hospital at your own peril,Never again I would rather go to a different hospital than come here.",1
THIS HOSPITAL IS A FANTASTIC PLACE TO GO AND BE SEEN AND THE DOCTORS AND NURSES ARE FANTASTIC WITH YOU AND ALL THE HOSPITAL STAFF ARE FANTASTIC WITH YOU,5
"I took my mum to ED on Sunday at about 2pm. She’s elderly and had fallen at home and had a big cut above her eyebrow. The reception area was clean and tidy, reception staff were friendly and helpful. We waited just over an hour to be triaged. The triage nurse was friendly and professional and the area was clean and tidy. We were sent to same day emergency care which is upstairs. Here is a criticism, the signage is rubbish at new cross, same day emergency care becomes SDEC and then swaps back. If you are elderly, confused, in pain, if English isn’t your first language things like this don’t help. SDEC was pretty busy and it was clear they were short of doctors. The triage nurse was incredible, she kept checking that all patients were accounted for and in the queue, she sought out other doctors when it was clear they were struggling to process patients. Some members of the public were pretty rude but she remained professional and is a credit to the trust.  Mum was seen by Dr Ian Davis who explained everything really carefully and was kind and polite to both of us. Mum then needed to have her head glued, again the HCA I think who did this was lovely, kind patient and did a great job. I’m so impressed with the care from new cross ED despite some incredibly challenging circumstances. We were there for just over 6 hours in all, it’s a long time but I know we were seen as quickly as possible given the circumstances. I want to thank everyone at new cross ED, please keep being kind, not everyone notices but we do and we are very grateful that you are our local hospital.",5
"Disgusting rules here. Not explained what’s happening, how they work! Being adhd it was cruel of them to judge, no sympathy! I need to know what’s going on with my unwell dad.
Staff don’t know what they’re doing there. Do their jobs properly and learn to listen, understand the distress than moaning. Should explain instead another member of staff explained. Very bad management! Don’t come here! As a daughter your not allowed to help your dad! Bunch of idiots who are ignorant who don’t understand! Sort it out management! Ladies at reception just sat their watching! They weren’t seeing my side even the management, was like talking to a brick wall. Top of that the lady who took my dad in for also a scan made my dad take his Kara off Sikh bangle which Sikhs can’t take off. My poor dad kept quiet he wasn’t himself anyway . Management at mri reception desk are all disgusting ! Get proper training!",1
Shame there isn't minus stars your a&e department must be the worst run in the country no body knows what they're doing waiting rooms full of people yet your only calling 1 person per hour no pain relief offered after waiting 5 hours to be seen and to top it off feeling like the doctor if that's what you call him is telling my son he's lying about being in pain! Seriously retrain your staff to have some compassion biggest joke of a place.,1
"This star represents the experience of one department in particular (i would give it no stars if i could).
Poor treatment from nurses after a total hysterectomy with a patient in her late 60's. Telling her not to change her pad too often even if soiled because it ""costs the NHS too much"" this was said forcefully, not helping the patient with her suitcase when she isn't supposed to be lifting after surgery. I could go on. She wasn't allowed visitors (understandable during a Pademic) however, this means patients are more vulnerable. There are  shortages and underfunding for departments but kindness and helping someone when they are unable costs nothing! I am considering writing a formal complaint as this may constitute abuse. However, felt it necessary to inform patients/visitors incase this is happening to someone they know.",1
"my sister, who was in labour having a c-section was in this hospital. they do not know how to do their job right, please if you are having a child, beg to go to another hospital absolutely appauling. they do not log things suchs as bruises from birth, or medical things to do with the baby.",1
"I attended A&E at 3.30am and left the SDEC clinic at 6.30pm without a diagnosis as the scan department forgot to send across to the A&E department before they left for the day! So I had another night of being in complete and utter pain without any treatment, I am now waiting on a call from someone to tell me what’s next.
The whole NHS process is diabolical, I work in healthcare and the system needs a massive change.",1
"I know a lot of people have negative reviews about hospitals in general but so far they have really looked after my brother and that's all that counts for me. Buy you loose one star because when I brought a pizza alive from greegs it was frozen and when I asked the woman to warm it up she said she's not allowed, so I just waited until I got home and warmed it up myself.",4
"I have  been to the hospital 3 times in the last 18 days  once at A&E and two  seperate appointments and I have to say the level of service has been outstanding. I was not kept waiting for long periods of time and the areas were clean. Keep it up, I was very Impressed 😃",5
Worst hospital in West Midlands. Got told by my GP to bring my 3 year old daughter to A&E as she’s showing signs of sepsis. She did not get prioritised even though people came in after us and got seen before us. All the staff came across rude and a ‘can’t do nothing about it’ attitude. I would NEVER come here again I’d rather travel to Birmingham to get me and my children seen. I’ve never been so ashamed of a hospital treating people the way they do. If your coming here for something very serious/life threatening avoid this hospital at all costs. Because they most definitely don’t prioritise young children with suspected sepsis as it’s not important enough for them.,1
"worst experience. I am pregnant and they don't gave me any priority. After 10 hours of waiting for the doctor i asked something to eat they don't bring anything i called my husband to bring me something to eat, when i told them that i am pregnant and i should eat something the nurse said ""you're pregnant?"" After 11 hours of waiting the doctor came he make a quick check and then leave he didn't gave me any medicine nothing at all so i left the hospital. they used to tell that i have low blood presure and low potasio but did nothing to make me feel better. worst hospital don't you ever go there expecelly when you re pregnant you won't get any priority. disgusting!",1
"Was completely and utterly disgusted at the treatment by receptionist at breast imagery. Supporting someone to attend their appointment. The receptionist on desk 1 a27 gave us a funny look and then completely ignored us both, looking back at her computer, so we went to desk 2 (luckily she was lovely). When we said we had an appointment to desk 2, desk 1 was suddenley interested and wanted to know who, what, where, when. after desk 2 helped us. Breast imagery had zero patience with the person i was supporting (the person couldn't mobilise), her name was jenny the breast imagery person, along with her colleague. They were rude, abrupt and had imcredibly poor people skills. They squashed the poor woman's arm between the mammogram machine and the arm of her wheelchair more than once and tried to force her into positions from her wheelchair that was impossible to do. They proceeded to kick me out the room so they could force the person I was supporting into positions. I could hear them outside the room, again, loosing patience. Breast imagery at new cross is not suitable for wheelchair users and to say I was shocked and angry at how the person I was supporting was treated is an understatement. I hope the breast imagery team for the mammograms can live with how they treated her. Thankfully the rest of the team were lovely to the person I was supporting, thank you.",1
My son went to b7 for Quincy on Saturday 15th and was put in the Sente I think that’s what it was called unit . The two staff were very empathetic and helped my son through the process which at times was very painful and he apologises for squeezing the nurses hand so tight .  Thank you to the sho on duty for your skill . I am forever grateful and keep up the good work xx,4
"Consultants  Doctors leading to a Surgeon.
One said to me before a operation on my partner. l don`t know. What l am going to find, it`s Like Digging a Hole in the road. Hurry up and make your mind. That year 2018/19 E&S paper reported all most 500 misdignosed deaths.Allso reported operated on wrong body parts. Worst Hospital in the Midland. Guess What. These so called Doctors are still there with Photo`s promoting themselves as Experts. Never Trust anyone. Do your own research and find a Specialist Not in New cross hospital...Not Even 1 star..",1
"Absolute disgrace. Kept my 4 month old waiting 4 hours. We enquired at that point how many people were before us and were told we were 20th in the queue. They were shouting out names about one every 15 mins, meaning we would likely be waiting another 5 hours! People who came in after us were seen before us, and some people were even seen several times in this period.

Patients were lying on the ground with young babies as if we were a third world country

Does New Cross feel it is acceptable to keep a 4 month old waiting this amount of time?! We eventually had to leave without seeing anybody.

Avoid like the plague. If indeed you do contract the plague, you would have better chances in an abattoir

Cheers",1
"Urgent Treatment Centre (walk in) Pleased we have it, but needs improvements. 1 person being called every 45+ minutes. Packed waiting room and waiting times are 4hrs (if your lucky) plus",3
"After being advised to call an ambulance by my GP at 11am by 9.30pm the ambulance had not arrived despite 5 calls to them due to being in excruciating pain and not being able to walk or sit. Eventually i had to be taken to A&E in the back of a car in excruciating pain.I was in A&E screaming in pain as I could not sit or stand. My partner asked if there was a bed or some where  for me to lie. Receptionists said no beds, no sympathy. I was just left trying to postion myself across plastic hard chairs in A&E crying in pain for 4 hrs!! With everyone looking.  Once in triage I was given cocodomal and then told to go to the next stage where there was a 6 hr wait for a Dr!! It was now 2am! I asked if there would be somewhere for me to lie whilst waiting for a Dr to be told no, no beds and the same plastic chairs despite not being able to sit or stand. I have since been diagnosed with a large herniated disc hence the pain. Thank you New Cross for the care and consideration shown especially to the receptionists and hospital staff who just looked over and turned away despite my distress. Such and embarrassing and upsetting time for both myself and partner who was at a loss at what to do.

Thanks for the cocodomal and for eventually seeing me after people were seen before me who had come in later than myself.

Disgraceful",1
"I can't even find words about disappointment i feel...My husband had car accident, he's been taken by ambulance to this hospital's emergency department. He had pain everywhere. Nurses said that will do scan for his back, because he had pain when he was trying to lift his legs.
When ambulance bring him, he was waiting for 3 hours. Left in a ward, he couldn't reach any emergency button, no water was left for him. He was alone and no one was coming to check, how is he. Final result... After 5 hours, doctor looked through him visually (maybe he had x ray in his eyes) and let him go away... Not even offering any medication for later.
I understand it's busy, I understand that EVERYONE are important. But nurse wasn't very nice. Didn't explain him, how long he need to wait. Atlest, when they brought him, they could do everything as it should be. I mean leaving patient with care and just to be sure that he can call for help if he needs. I been working in care and I know how everything should be. And it's not that way. Very disappointing.",1
"Over 2 hours we've sat here, my partner having breathing problems, only 2 people before us, but a steady stream of people coming after us were all seen while we sat here waiting. It wasn't until my partner told the receptionist that he needed to go outside for some fresh air that she disappeared and miraculously found someone to see him! If it had been busy I could of understood it.",1
"My 96 year old dad was admitted with pneumonia. I have no complaints about how he was treated at A&E and C24. But the visiting system is ridiculous. It seems to be a hang over from covid times - controlling  visitor numbers, but covid can't be used as an excuse because mask-wearing in the hospital is no longer required. You have to book a slot on the day of your visit - not much use if you're travelling from far away. You have to collect a piece of paper from a department that isn't easily located, and then find your ward. I could only find a parking space at a point furthest away from the ticket point. I also have mobility issues, so by the time I got to the ward with my ticket I was in tears. All to see my very sick 96 year old dad. I asked the sister in charge of the ward if I could please come snd visit without the rigmarole and was told 'no, those are the rules'. She was extremely rude - I'm sure discretion is allowed, but she felt like being officious snd wanted to show me who was boss. Where's  the compassion in this place of care? This system MUST CHANGE!!!",2
"I began attending new cross after too many terrible experiences at another hospital.

The care I received was amazing, the doctors are incredibly knowledgeable and caring. A lot of the consultants are true experts in their specialities. The admin teams are friendly - receptionists are helpful and kind. Appointments are received quickly.

The buildings aren’t as modern as some other hospitals, but please don’t let that put you off - the care and expertise are phenomenal. Hate off to the management team 🎩",5
"Very rude staff at A and E, no Duty of  care to the patient. My nephew was dragged out of A and E by a member if staff because one if the staff said he's not an emergency case. She shouted across saying take him out and place him in the waiting area. When minutes before my nephew dad passed away in your care. We have faith and believe to ne treated with respect. Very disappointed and disgusted amend the staff at your department.",1
Awful place to go when your ill. Come down at 10 in morning and was still sitting on a chair come half 9 at night. Got left in a room for 2 hours completely forgot about. Also not one offer of a glass of water but everyone else gets asked. No organisation at all and no help when it comes to pain and to top it off all the doctors like to tell you that your not in pain absolute terrible place. Been up 20 times in 2 years with same issue and nothing sorted.,1
"Waiting in emergency care for nearly 6 hours to only be told by a rude inconsiderate uncompassionate nurse she didn't know what was wrong with me then sent home still in pain, I would rather drown in my own blood than go through those doors again at Newcross. How dare you close my complaint, now it's re opened I refuse to have it closed until I am satisfied, disgraceful",1
"I cant say I've always had the best experiences with new Cross but the maternity ward was spectacular with me. Some nurses were a bit formal but they had been on from the time I was put on the ward at 5 in the morning and still there at lunch time so I can't blame them. All the midwives who helped me deliver were absolutely amazing and really took care of me and were so sweet with my daughter, they even came in half an hr before I was due to be reviewed for release and said the doctor would definitely be releasing me and told my sisters to wait after visiting hrs finished so I didn't have to wait for someone to come pick me up after being released I could just leave with them, I was ready to go as soon as they said I could no muss no fuss",4
"Over 6 hours wait in A&E for a 5 minute treatment. During that time only 1 doctor was working and seeing patients all by himself whilst other doctors holding papers and walking around killing time, this is the words and thoughts of fellow patients and the doctor who was left to shoulder the pressure of seeing patients. Absolutely disgrace, arrogant and disgusting behaviour of the other doctors not doing their job and taking advantage of their high paid jobs. In addition, after speaking with the doctor who seemed over whelmed and potentially over stressed by the lack of support of his fellow colleagues the number of doctors on shift was low.

I hope someone within the hospital trust can address this issue and look into improving.",1
Great staff as always but parking can be a bit difficult,5
"I had to go to New Cross Hospital when I collapsed from severe Diverticulitis.  I was hospitalised for 6 days and in that time I only ate rice crispies, the food was awful.  The ward was filthy and the bathroom was worse.  I went in the one day for a shower and there was a small black carrier bag over the tap on the sink, I thought someone had left their toiletries but when I looked it was a colostomy bag, it was still there the next day with wet and dirty towels on the floor.  I really hope I never have to go back there!",1

2.5 h waiting in children emergency waiting room with my 5 years son who has 39 degrees temperature and still waiting..... This makes me never to think to come to the doctor again.",1
"Waited over 10 hours for treatment at A&E and urgent care.

Referred by my GP to A&E waited for 3 hours to be seen by the triage nurse who spent the matter of 2 minutes with me and half that time he spent talking to another nurse about paracetamol about another patient in front of me breaching patient confidentiality. Was sent up to urgent care centre by hisself to go and get anti sickness, when I tried to explain I'm already on anti sickness and I'm allergic to other anti sickness he brushed me off and told me to just go. Gave me a discharge paper which stated pain level 4, this question was not asked as well as my current medications was left blank when I take multiple meds. Sat another 4 hours to see someone in urgent care. Who then sent be back down to A&E. waited another 2 hours to be seen when the triage nurse told me I'd have to restart the process and be put at the back of the queue. When I declined this as I had already been there for 9hours without treatment, they told me to sit in the waiting room and eat and drink. I explained I cannot just sit in there eating and drinking as I was referred due to vomiting when ever I tried to eat or drink and I don't want the humiliation of sitting there vomiting in front of everyone. Where she stated ""well if I knew that I wouldn't have suggested it"". Yet another example of lack of information gain from staff. Was sent up to the emergency care centre waited another 1 and half to be seen and the only redeeming part of being seen by this hospital was a lovely doctor that spent time to explain things to me, gave me a direct plan of action and course of treatment.
Will be reporting to PALS and CQC for unsafe practice, lack of information taken, incorrect information stated on medical records and more.",1
"Hospital Number: V2817
I would like to thank all involved in my operation and care, service was fantastic and nurses etc were very caring.

Came to A and E as advised by my gp. Got there at 16.39 waited in A and E had ecg and blood pressure at 20.15 then sent up to the SDEC at 20.45 told at 1.00 am could gave another 7 hour wait to see doctor as only one doctor on from then. So will see how long it takes to see doctor,1
"I haven’t got anything nice to say so I’m not going to say a lot apart from someone needs to go undercover and see how people are being treated here. I was left, in a wheelchair, crying and groaning in agony at the entrance to A/E and told to phone a family member to collect me. This was my discharge. I was given codeine and a set of crutches as I couldn’t walk. I’m happy to say I am making a recovery at home from a prolapsed disc. I was told to phone my own GP to arrange physio and an x-Ray.  I have never felt so vulnerable and I pray to God I never have to go back there. As a clinical support worker my standards are way above anything I received in this hospital.",1

If you got no connections they will leave you dying in the reception. They refused to see me just because it I had dental issue!!!!!

"I had a heart attack and went into cardiac arrest.  Was operated on immediately and looked after by hard working and dedicated individuals.  The surgeons, doctors, nurses and assistants were all blooming fabulous and listened to me and treated me with dignity and respect.  I Owe them my life.

Those whining about delays as little Timmy is crying as he is poorly…. You are not an emergency.  Sorry, but if your not dying you are not at the top of the list and rightly so.
If you have time to go elsewhere you don’t have an emergency!

The a&e team may have timing delays for accidents but for emergencies they really don’t mess about.

Only minor gripe - sorry your hot food is rank!  Please give jacket potato or similar as an alternative.

Thank you for keeping me alive and for my two newly fitted stents xxx",5
"Waiting time is shocking,  nurse triage seems to be quick but after that you just sit down for hours until your bum is numb and feet swelling before you can see the doctor, they just tell you it won't be long. I'm not sure if they can define what does ""long"" mean. But also no screen to show how far are you on queue. Just not good enough",2
I took my father to A&E on Monday at 10.30 pm and now it's Tuesday 7am and we are still here.He is 82 years old and has waited 8.5 hours already. Totally unreasonable. Shame on you Newcross hospital. There are oaps who have been waiting 8 hours plus.its  Very bad. Not just for the old but everyone here,1
"My mom visited NewCross hospital Wednesday as she was in lots of pain.
All the staff there treated her disrespectfully.
Mom mom has recently lost her husband and struggles to go to hospital but she was in so much pain she had to.
My mom was waiting for hours and family wasnt allowed to stay with her. We did inform the nurses that she was vulnrable as she was very depressed.
We called the hospital to see where my mom was and they said they discharged her. In the state my mom was in all the family were concerned that she had harmed herself as we couldnt fine her.
We rang the hospital and family oy memebers went up to find her to be told to stop calling and stop sending people up as she  wasnt there to find out that she was discharged at 17.17 but not told her and left her sitting on a ward all day and night.
When asking the nurses they said that she was just sitting there and they didnt bother to see what she was doing they ignored her and walked and worked around her on a ward!
My mom had comments like ""why are you crying?""
My mom would say i am in pain can you help i am feeling depressed"" to a responce from a GP "" we are all depressed love""
The nurses pulling at her clothes  to take bloods without taking to her or asking her.
The events resulted in the nurses ignoring my mom while she was in pain and upset while her family and the police are searching the streets to see if she is dead or alive. My mom will not go back here as there was no respect for my mom. A big thank you to a security Gaurd that wouldnt give up me by helping me access the waed she was on to find her as he could see we were very concerned",1
"It's just 10 mints away from home by road, having a very worst experience ever so giving 1 star for this. It's a very low and third class hospital which has such a slow treatment, that we had waited 3-4 weeks just for the blood test. It's really disgusting. In such a gap for a blood test what if patient will die? Even after waiting for 2 months for my wife's reports they can't even find out the reason of her illness and what kind of problem she has!",1
"Phoned 111 and got an appointment for 2pm, waited 2 hours to be seen and I then told the doctor what was wrong with me as I’ve had this problem in the past, they just said I was fine and sent me home… 3 days later my problem has got worse and now turning into an infection, thanks so much for your wonderful trained staff! May as well train a bunch of chimps to do your jobs I’m sure they’d be better! Waste of taxpayers money!",1

What an absolute shambles. Took my dad here as his leg had swollen.after waiting 5 hours in a&e being passed about from pillow to post he was seen now bearing in mind my dad suffers dementia & they wouldn't let me in so was in the dark and worried sick.all staff just stand about chatting about their lives while patients just sit there. So after 7 hours he had been seen by doctor & was told he was being treated for a blood clot & as you can imagine we was all concerned.they sent him home with an injection that I had to give him on the following morning to thin his blood.we were told to go back day after for a scan so 8.15am was his appointment time yet again still by 8.45 we were still looking for the correct place.waited another 5 hours to be told he had to have an xray so after waiting yet again we was told he had a sprained ankle??? As if this couldn't have been sorted the first time we went there.very poor communication.i appreciate the NHS does a fantastic job but this service my dad recieved was shocking over 12 hours to tell us something they should have checked when we went in.,1
"Some excellent staff, nice food, good communication with external services.
Like most hospitals, it needs more nurses etc, but most are doing their best under pressure.",4
"Hospital was a disgrace
Went in with my partner after calling 111. They told us to go to the hospital straight away and told us that she has booked an appointment for us so we do not have to wait.
We arrived at the hospital and we were told we have to wait. As this was going on my partner’s throat was swelling at a Considerable rate. We finally got seen by a doctor who told my partner to say “ahhh” and then just told us it was ‘probably viral tonsillitis or covid ‘ even though my partner had taken a lateral flow test and came back negative. Then he proceeded to tell us that lateral flow test are not reliable at all which makes me wonder why they  got rid of PCR tests in the first place if lateral flows are not valid.
Then he told my partner just to take paracetamol even though she can not swallow anything and had tried taking some before calling 111. In the waiting room, there were cotton pads with blood on them dotted around and issues everywhere. Overall I would not recommend this hospital to anyone, especially if it’s serious!",1
"I wouldn't even give 1star, more than 6 hour wait, just 1 doctor to see everyone, its a joke, this what we pay NHS for, all the nurses are standing around gossiping do nothing, this hospital needs to be shut down, and royal hospital needs to be reopened. New Cross hospital is a joke,it was discussting treatment, there was a lady left sitting with a open flesh wound for hours, a pore old woman in a wealchair was left 4 7 hours no treatment and her husband had to take her home, I saw 8 people who needed treatment leave, they also left a old man with a slit head waiting for ages, everyone needs to vote to get new cross hospital replaced with a better hospital and better staff, only the security are helpful and push people around, nurses do don't do much, only some are okay, the rest stand around gossiping about nonsense. We all deserve better.",1
The doctor told me I’m faking everything as ‘young people want attention’ and told me to ‘go home and sleep it off’,1
had a very bad chest infection which antibiotics couldn't get rid of. I was treated quickly and efficiently. everyone was brilliant and I'm still in for further tests. never had any problem with this hospital. brilliant,5
"Have had some amazing experiences with the NHS over the years. Especially QE Birmingham who helped support my father through a terrible time.

Would have given this place 0 if I could have. Was told to attend A&E after seeing my gp with kidney stones. When I arrived I saw the triage after 2 and half hours.

She then told me It was going to be at least 4 hours before I'm seen again. Triage even said these are the wait times for the evening and If I work I'm going to keep getting this service and I should think about coming at other hours when they are less busy.

On another level my father was admitted here earlier this year and they had strict conditions about people not entering to see him, even though he had tested negative for covid. I was kept apart from him during his final day's whilst others were still aloud to see relatives. No consistency and absoloutely poor, its like its just a production line.",1
"A relative 85 was transferred from cannock after a knee replacement due to a blood clot in the lungs they thought.
Waited in ambulance for 2 hours at new cross spent 3 nights there came out traumatised

Due to staff being very aggressive and unfriendly said she would never go there again after the treatment she received  will be putting a formal complaint in very soon.

Please people if you have any relatives especially if elderly have or can use a mobile phone for their own protection .

please people if elderly relatives go there please make sure you find out they are being cared for correctly and if they are able make sure they have and can call you on a mobile phone.

Very concerm",1
"Why this hospital gets anything less than five stars is totally beyond me, They have effectively kept my parents alive for the last 15 years and are still continuing to do so, incredible staff from the ward nurses right up to the surgeons and consultants. Massively understaffed yet somehow they still manage to do what they do day in day out. You are all massively appreciated for everything you do day in day out.",5
"My daughter was having high  temperature.she has asthma and was breathing fast in early hours I called 111 they said to get her checked within 1 hour.
Went to the hospital and seen at children’s area the nurse asked me WHY ARE YOU AT ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY?  I was shocked what to say to that question she was so rude and said your daughter is looking just fine right now. YEAH WE JUST CAME FOR  A WALK TO THE HOSPITAL!!  😡
We were sent to out patient the receptionist there was rude again as if she  hate her job.and had to wait another 2.5 hours literally no one called for till 1.5 hour no patient was called .Kids were crying there’s nothing to keep kids busy.  Horrible place you just look at empty pale walls !
After that doctor just sent us home saying she has viral infection he couldn’t even prescribed an ear drop for her said call your GP.
I had the worst 3 hours at this hospital today made me sick. Why are we paying taxes if our kids can’t even get the right treatment in this country ! Make the NHS PRIVATE then hopefully people won’t have to spend half day sitting and watching walls in these hospitals!",1
"Staff here are absolutely lovely. Have been really helpful and caring to my Nan who’s currently staying in. Really impressed, thank you NHS workers.",5
"Had to call 111 for mom
Was asked to go urgent care centre
Had a booked appointment
Was seen at 4.30
After badgering the receptionist
Was then asked to go to
The
Same day emergency care dept
Never heard of it before
Been here since 5 not one dr has seen us
Had bloods in an hour n half
Still waiting
Reason being people are being sent up here to have bloods and  other treatment and are seen before those from the urgent care sept, so you are queuing AGAIN. Trying to make stats look good , it’s not patient care. A dr called a name an hour ago and the patient not here. He’s called em again just
So what’s he been doing since then , because he hasn’t called. Anyone since
Disgusted , I’m a health professional too , very disappointed

"My dad has stage 4 pancreatic cancer and unfortunately developed sepsis. He has been in hospital 4 nights so far treating the infection. In my eyes the team on the ward have been brilliant! Keeping him in making sure it is safe for him to leave. Nurses, doctors and surgeons are the real heroes. Thank you all New Cross staff for your passion and hard work.",5
The doctors and nurses are doing a fantastic job. However on more than one occasion when I've been asked to gel my hands the sanitiser has been empty and I've been told not to worry about which I don't think is acceptable also I have been unable to get receipts for parking as the roll had run out of paper and therefore had to walk a far distance to the security office to get one. It's just not good enough. We pay our taxes for this and on top of this they want to privatise the NHS which is all about profit and not the care of the patients,4
"My 3rd  visit in one week
Ist was to see a vascular consultant. Every one was very pleasant, and the waiting room had plenty of hand gel, and wasn't over crowded. 2nd visit was for my daughter. And my 3rd visit was to have my legs scanned, nurse was very understanding about pain in my legs, I couldn't have been treated any better. So thank you newcross hospital",4
"It is rather hit and miss depending on what department you need to get help from. A&E were not very great when I called them to get information on my mum who was there for check ups and even hung up on me. I felt absolutely  annoyed and that they gave no care to her. When a doctor talked to me on the phone it sounded like she is in the middle of an air port hardly could here and was very keen to get off the phone as soon as possible without telling me anything and told me a nurse would call me... no nurse called me at all. Nearly everyone I talked to there apart from one lady has been unpleasant, unhelpful and liked to hang up on the phone rather than tell you anything.",2
"Plenty of car parks access to public transport.
Friendly helpful staff.  Didn't wait to long for my appointment.",4
"Whilst I appreciate how busy the NHS and a and e are? A 6 and 1/2 hour wait for a child to be seen is ridiculous . Little communication given and box ticking obs taken at 3 hours and 50 mins
to tick the seen in 4 hours box.
Cannot fault the nurse practitioner we saw eventually. However too many children and babies left in pain and upset.",2
"We had excellent experience at A/E and A21. Good, caring staff and clean, good looking wards, well decorated everywhere, lovely set up kids play area/garden. However, have to mention two male doctors came from nowhere, demanding to examine my little one and trying to change the plan set up by other doctors earlier.... I think you need to understand exactly what's going on and have some kind of idea of what to expect from treatment. Otherwise, you'll be discharged before you know it by one of those incompetent/arrogant doctors....Medical staff shouldn't be afraid to challenge. Apart from that, experience was very positive. Thank you.",4
"My wife had an elected c section on Monday and all started well the theater staff were brilliant, however once being moved to the maternity ward things started to go wrong.
No communication and poor care getting my wife out of bed after 6 hours even though she told the nurses she didn't feel well enough causing her to nearly faint and ending up back in bed.

We were then discharged on Wednesday at this point nobody had given our baby his new born checks.",1
"I would like to take this opportunity to say a massive thank you to the staff at this Hospital, nothing is to much trouble for these guys. Just had an emergency appointment in the gynaecology department Dr I saw was brilliant as for the nurse Monica what a diamond she is to the department so pleasant and helpful nothing was to much trouble for her. The ward I was on last week same there all so pleasant obviously they love the job they are doing in particular Sister Churchill and Alison they made my stay so comfortable, I had a problem when I got home Sister Churchill said to ring  ward if I had problems so I did, spoke to Sister Churchill she was helpful,big thank you to her and a big thank you to all the staff there brilliant Hospital.",5
"Before I start I'd like to say I have the upmost respect for our NHS Dr's and nursing staff....
March 17th 2020 I was diagnosed with PMR by the Rheumatology consultant, she was a very nice person and I felt as though I had received a good service!!! BUT the follow up as been diabolical!!! Needed a 3month follow up appointment, x-rays on my hands, blood tests, I must fill in a chart marking steroid intake, not to stop taking them and to contact if I had more serious symptoms!! Well.....No follow up at all, drug chart is full, no advice on reduction of steroids, got the jaw, tooth and temple pain!!! Can't get to see my Dr, Consultant on holiday...told to go to A&E if I get double vision, not easy for me as I have other diagnosed but ignored disabilities!!! Just wondering what my thousands of pounds in NI over the last 45 yrs as been for. Terrible, disappointed and upset. 😠😠😠",2
"I just want to say a Big Thank You to Dr Luke (from A & E) and all the staff at New Cross. Dr Luke took his time to understand how I was feeling, was more thorough than any other doctor I’ve seen and gave exceptional care. He ensured I got the tests I needed, kept me informed every step of the way and I felt reassured when given results. In all the departments I went to for scans (x-Ray, CDU, CCU and CT) everyone was really friendly and made me feel at ease.

I will definitely only return to Newcross for future care. Amazing team work and professionalism.",5
"I have been in New Cross hospital since Monday and I can't fault them from the domestics upwards.
Great care given, I'm on ward A9. My stay has been very pleasant (apart from the pain of gall stones)",5
"35 weeks pregnant admitted with severe shortness of breath, all staff absolutely amazing, from Ed, to xray, nuclear medicine, cardiology and all Maternity Triage, huge thank you! Couldn't wish for a better service, so attentive and caring. Absolutely marvellous!",5
"Disgraceful place.. Ward c42 and gastro,  unkept, understaffed. People on tagged bays wondering around and falling. I witnessed so much I could write a book.
I man died because he fell and went into cardiac arrest,  had to listen to the sister lie to a distraught family.

1 nurse to 2 bay's,  the elderly going un fed.
I had to wash and dry myself with a pillow case and large sanitary pad as no towels.

I spent most of my stay pressing buzzers for people,  filling up water jugs and putting fall risk patients back in there chairs.

Caught 2 nurses fast asleep at the desk.

I could go on and on..

Lots witnessed the things I saw.

Needs shutting down. Dangerous place.",1
"Don't go here if you need help with mental health, went in for severe depression and ocd and was treated with contempt. The staff including the nurses seemed generally angry with me from the start. I was placed in a room with a chair and wasnt told anything by the staff they just pointed me to the chair and didnt talk to me. To make things worse the room was opposite the main desk and the staff just glared at me like i was some kind of alien that they didn't want to go near. When I asked a staff member what was happening they said a doctor was coming this was after about 3 hours of being stared at by the main reception staff who were more interested in ordering there dominoes pizza than me. I was thirsty and hungry and afraid similar to being on an alien space craft . After about 5 hours someone came to take my blood pressure and asked me medical questions but they seemed extremely aggitated with me. I was scared of them to be honest. In the end i said i wanted to go home and was fed up of waiting this was after about 8 hours by the way. They became extremely argumentative and said i had only been waiting a short time, i realised that it was pointless debating the wait time with them because it would only have agitated them more. I tried to leave but was told i had wait in the room and was taken back there for a further 3 hours and a mental health team did come in the end but they didnt offer me any support. I dont know why they have a bias towards mental illness but this is not an isolated incident and has happened to me before there. I would suggest if you have to go for urgent treatment and have a mental illness never go there alone like i did. Sorry nhs i needed to tell someone about this, you have scarred me mentally for life.",1
"I've never been one to be too dramatic over illness. I went for 15 years without seeing my GP. I had a Vertigo episode recently, whereby, I felt that there was something serious happening to me. I would be the last person ever to ask for an ambulance to be called out but I genuinely felt like a heart attack was coming on or that I'd had a minor stroke. I can only say that the care and attendance and understanding I had from New Cross staff was nothing short of exceptional. There were a lot of trainee staff dealing with me but they were very transparent about it and everybody seemed to be learning. God bless the NHS. Long live the NHS! A big shout-out to Andy, who took me from my cubicle to have a head scan. I was so scared, I cannot even explain, but he put my nerves at ease, without even trying. A lot of people can and will criticise, but by god, when I felt I needed them, they were there. Big up NHS.",5
"AWFUL.

at the age of 19 i was told i was expected to have a stroke by my gp. went straight into a&e to be stared at funnily by the receptionist. she told my nan to wait outside leaving me scared and alone never being in hospital with the thought of having a stroke could happen. everyone else had people with them which really upset me. i was saw fairly quickly but the nurses were all blunt and rude. i was asking questions and was just told to wait for an ecg. i had an ecg and was saw by a lovely doctor after being sent to sdec. but i was discharged and told to come off my contraceptive pill. so i did. last night i spoke with 111 who told me to go back in straight away and i did. i waited ages to be seen and again, had an ecg. was told i needed to do a covid test which i was happy to do. but i had tested negative 3days in a row. 1 hour 30 later after sitting in a small room by myself, a nurse came and said “yeah you’re positive just wait for the doctor” WHERE IS THE PROOF? she walked off fastly without me having chance to ask for it. i was simply sent home. something didn’t feel right. guess what? negative results for covid. just simply didn’t want to run more specific checks obviously. i feel like an absolute joke to this place. i’ve never once had covid, triple jabbed, it doesn’t make sense. i haven’t been anywhere and most importantly i’m NEGATIVE! sorry for the long message but i’m so upset with how i’ve been treated. god forbid how elderly people are cared for here if this is how you treat a 19 year old",1
"I am disappointed how one of HCA was treated me.I come to hospital by ambulance I couldn't move my legs was paraliz. Hca was telling to the doctor I am petting because I was sitting in the wheelchair in waiting are and I looks fine .she told I must to get up from wheelchair because doctor must to do assessment with me and she can't help because of policy. I couldn't get up .Doctor said to leave me on wheelchair during assessment I start feel sick I couldn't even speak to the consultant give any answers .Doctor admitted me I stay 3 weeks In hospital. The Doctor said I have FND.I don't wish anyone to be treated like me .The lady HCA should to really think how she behave. I use to be HCA as well and I can't imagine to treat patients like this.The nurse on the shift was speaking so loud by the
desk I could hear every single words about another patient how they comment patients. The ward was CDU.Hope I will never back there again .",1
"Wonderful, caring staff in the Radiology department. My 90 year old mom attended an appointment on 2/3/2021, the staff, especially the lady manning the Radiology cabin could not have been kinder. Well done to all under these trying times.",5
The service is disgusting they book appointments for you and everytime I attend my appointment I have to wait 45mins to an hour to been seen and my mum is a nurse but when I told the receptionist that like she doesn't care. We are in the midst of a pandemic where lives are been lost and for a hospital not to care about others is  dispicable for that kind of behaviour. The receptionist then told me there been an emergency which they are running 30mins behind so I ask all the time I attend my appointment there's been an emergency. In this antenatal clinic u can never been seen ontime always 45mins to an hours before they see you and if you arrive 10mins or more late they refuse to see you and told you that you need to rebook.,2
"We've had 2 children delivered here and the girls on the maternity wards are absolutely fantastic, a real credit to the NHS, so it's a bit disappointing to have to leave a 2 star review after being let down by the Urgent Treatment Centre.

We called 111 after our daughter started looking particularly unwell after catching conjunctivitis, after explaining she had a very high temperature the call handler suggested we go to the UTC and booked us an APPOINTMENT for 19:45.
I turned up at 19:40 and was told ""we aim to see all appointed Patients within an hour and 15 minutes""... Ok, I thought, must just be a standard line they tell everyone.
2 hours later, with my daughter asleep in my arms, I approached the desk and asked if she was likely to be seen any time soon. The response was ""you've got 2 more children in front of you. I can't guarantee how long it'll be, but it shouldn't be too long"", so on that I decided to take our chances and take her home to rest. A complete waste of time (and money) attending, I'd have been better putting my daughter to bed and giving her Calpol.",2
"Blood cancer department. Doctor Lee and her amazing team .Jackie and Jessie. Very  professional ,friendly ,and supportive.  Amazing people who deserve recognition for there hard work and dedication they give there patients. First class  team with hearts of gold. Thank you for helping me.",5
"THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTE RUBBISH AND ID RATHER DIE THAN GO HERE ever again.

I once went here suffering from a side effect of a medication - I was talking to the reception lady on A and E and she was huffing and puffing looking down on me subliminally ;the  white lady actually had the audacity to say ‘there are more important things to do here’ as if I were exploited the system or something I felt like this was pure racism. I didn’t want to argue with her so I left it be and quietly waited. Nobody brings any sort of illness on themselves.

Another time I went here with a severe migraine after prescribed medication.. the doctor who saw me was Arab I believe and held my forehead and chanted Islamic prayers whilst the nurse at the back laughed at me , I then had to return again at a later date and had treatment. What the actually Fudge? Wasted my money and journey on top of that fobbed me off?

Is this what we pay our taxes for ? To be discriminated and treated like less than human beings?",1
"The ambulance crew saved my Life by getting be there whilst having a heart attack. I became completely unconscious and remember nothing.

Then the emergency department saved my life.

I woke up in the ward after the operation the care I received was excellent.

Nothing was too much trouble.

Thank-you is not enough is it.",5
"If I could give no stars I would. Been sat in A&E for 4 hours and I have been seen by no one. There has been several shift changes but no help at all.

**Update**
After 6 hours I got seen by a lovely doctor but in the end I still have to deal with my issue myself.
As many people have said it is quite hit or miss with this hospital",1
"Avoid this hospital at all costs! Terrible management with the constant rescheduling of appointments. Just to get my wisdom teeth removed I had to wait almost a year and with the rescheduled appointment, it is another 6 month wait. Best to try your luck elsewhere. Simply shocking!",1
"Terrible experience- NO stars from me but it would only let me post my review if I gave it at least one. I Was admitted for 10 days and just felt like, us as the patients were a huge inconvenience. If a patient buzzed for assistance from a nurse you were ignored and could be left waiting for unto 20 minuets. So, if your in real need of help, (fighting for breath for example) you'll be dead before they get there. For Patients that were bed bound and needed help going to the toilet, this is just not acceptable. There was a definite lack of enthusiasm from the night staff, day staff were better but if you needed help getting washed/showered etc you were easily forgotten. I had no after care advice after suffering acute pancreatitis, it was only after going on the NHS website that I found  the foods that I needed to avoid. I however do not hold the staff completely responsible for this poor care giving, it's the strain that's on the NHS.",1
"I've never known a hospital as poor as this one. No matter how many times you come here the waiting times are never anything below 8 hours.
Children aren't prioritised at all.
And the some of the staff are so careless.
I'd rather travel to Birmingham than come here again..",1

Good place for time wasters.
Shame on them",1
"Previous experiences - food  ' ugh ' Parking an absolute nightmare-  staff lovely but so over worked.
Admission 18 months ago- food very good and excellent choice, staff so nice but very busy. More nursing staff needed. Parking still as before. One department, which I will not mention, needs a serious 'shake up '

Recent emergency visit to A & E  2017-  Ease  of parking 8/10. Seen very quickly , scan done, injections and medication given, all in just over 3 hours. All Drs and nurses and other staff were so kind to me.  Could not have been better.",5

"I recently gave birth to my second child in the hospital's midwife led unit. It was the absolute best experience I could have asked for. A far cry from the birth I experienced at Walsall Manor with my first child. The staff were fantastic, could not have been more friendly and helpful. The atmosphere in the room was so calming and it definitely had a massively positive impact on my labour. I cannot thank the unit enough for helping me to bring my daughter into the world in such a perfect way.",5
"I can’t really say I’m impressed, we’ve never been there before and we went into a bad e. My baby sister had swallowed a magnet and we were told to get there within the hour. So we went to reception and it took 2 and a half hours to be seen while the nurses and doctors showed each other photos online to each other around a table. So I can’t emphasise enough that we won’t be going there again. And not to mention to staff that we were served by, very rude and dismissive. We were told we were to be next about 1 hour in, and we were around 7th after we were told this. Very clean facilities but staff weren’t helpful.",2
"Was okay once the staff got some commen sense about the problem I was having.
Got to A&E 1 hr to be seen by triage.
2 hrs waiting in A&E for a doctor.
An hour spent waiting in a room with a bed
Another 2 hrs spent waiting in the room by xray for them to figure out why I couldn't do what they needed. & then 2hrs in urgent care, finally getting treatment.
I went in at 3pm on a Monday left at 11pm that Monday night. I can't be sure on waiting times for near xray as I kept falling asleep in there because I was in pain & exhausted.
Google could have told them the reason I couldn't pee I knew why I couldn't don't get why it took them 2 hours +. All to see if I was pregnant so I could have an xray I didn't end up having. & nothing about what I should do if I end up having an episode that bad again.

& someone explain why some people get to have people with them for support & others don't it's stupid pretty sure the rules were unless u were a parent, u were giving birth or to visit someone that was dying. Because trust me the couple next to me needed a hotel room not A&E.",3
My husband was taken to New Cross from walk in centre. He was taken to C58 where is care was second to none. After a couple of days he was transferred to A9 and put into side room 7 and again  all the staff were amazing. They are fully stretched to the limit. Cannot fault them. Thank you so much.,5
"Overstaffed by lazy people. How can you justify having 2 team members sitting on a reception at 5am .What are they doing? There is something wrong at the core of the NHS. The culture amount the non medical team is lazy with an overinflated sense of their importance.
6 hours and 20 minutes and my 6 year old with breathing difficulties has not been seen.
During the first wave of the pandemic I had to come here with my 3 year old. She had croup. There was no one in the waiting room in A&E. But they had 3 team members on reception watching videos on their phones..
sell the nhs and get rid of the useless team members.
After tonight farce,I'm going private.",1
"A&e reception staff are rude, make it pretty obvious they don’t want to be there. After checking in at reception I saw one patient come in with family nothing life threatening as was still laughing talking and able to move around to be greeted with a doctor running out to them giving hugs and kisses and told them to come on straight through. Patient hadn’t even checked in. Very unprofessional... we’re all there as patients and should be assessed to prioritise patients. Actually disgusted a doctor could be that unprofessional in front of a whole waiting area of patients.
A bit later on another patient came in checked and waited, whilst waiting this patient started vomiting badly. The reception staff saw and heard it and both were not busy with other patients checking in but both ignored the situation until the patients friend went to reception to tell them and ask for Paper and water for patient. One lady off reception went and got a sick bowl latex gloves paper towels and handed them to the patients friend to clean it up rhemset!!!! Disgusting!!! The whole row was covered on the floor with vomit, area needed to be disinfected and a sign to be put up to say floor was wet. Nothing! I fact another patient went to get more paper towels from the toilets as reception hadn’t even give them enough. Stay clear of this a&e!!!",1
"Doctor S Lee, non hodgkin consultant  with her amazing angel nurses Jackie and Jezz.  Big shout to you all. My experience with you was 1st class and more. Your kind ,genuine, and very passionate for helping us cancer patients. Even on my bad days nothing was ever a problem with you guys,.You always resolved my fears  and had a solution to all my problems and  side effects . Most importantly  you can feel the love and passion doctor lee and her  team give you . They go above and beyond to help you feel safe and comfortable.  Very experienced  team work. The rest of the departments at new Cross, should take  take a leaf out of your book and treat us with the respect and dignity you guys do , . Doctor lee knows her job .her experience shines through. Jackie and Jezz are amazing . These ladies are angels.  They put there heart and soul into there job and it is very much appreciated by me. Thank you. You need recognising for your outstanding support and medical  knowledge . You  are a credit to New Cross and the NHS. Highly highly recommend Doctor SLee and her team.",5
"I've been attending new Cross as an in and also out patient over the past ten years.  Overall, everyone from the Consultants, Doctors, Nurses and Porters (basically everyone,) work together to form an amazing team!  In a hospital of this magnitude doing so is no mean feat and I know not for the feint of heart.  Sympathetic and even loving towards patients is a constant.  Of course they have their ups and downs but still 100% dedicated.  Thank you New Cross.",5
"I attended the heart department of the heart and lung Centre Wednesday 10th March 2021 at 16.10pm, as directed by my Doctor.  This is due to having serious blood pressure lows, racing heartbeat a resting heart rate of 90 bpm on a daily basis and other symptoms around Xmas time.  He told me to record my blood pressure and heart rate 4 times daily.  I did this for 3 months.  I attended this appointment after a 3 month wait.  The female who carried out the appointment attached the electrodes, looked at the screen and said ""Your heart rate is between 70-80, you're fine"" then proceeded to remove the electrodes and told me to get dressed.  I asked ""Is it fine that my heart rate goes upto 117 when I've only climbed the stairs?""
She responded ""No... But that's for your Doctor to deal with, not us""
I could've checked my heart rate at home and the Doctor could've done this for me, also.  Waste of my time and the car park fee.",1
"Long waits, but superb service.
Bit of confusion between urgent care, & same day emergency treatment depts..

Way how they treat forenational people is redicilous. English people come to doctor without que. People who came after me have visit after 30 min. After almost 4 hours waiting still same time waiting as we arrived Here. Rasist and discrimination staff. Also security without mask pushing people to where masks. its a Joke 🤬,1
Booked in maternity to see our first grandchild realy exited and emotional to be told when we got to the ward it's only 1 visitor per day .christ we are grand parents that means 2 .God the trust realy knows how to upset my daughter  and myself  very angry,1
"I suffer with adhesion and I Have been in and out of Hospital since the age of 18, I am know 60, I have been to A&E twice in the lost couple of months with vomiting and pain in the stomach, and the A&E staff have been so nasty to me, because I feel better when i have vomited and all my food is out, I was told to have Andrew at home to make my self sick, so I don’t need to go to the hospital for pain relief, this time I didn’t hear the Ambulance crew say to me that I should have intravenous paracetamol, I thought they meant paracetamol by mouth and if I did have it by mouth it would have to come out to make my self better.  Anyway I was at the blood room having my bloods done, I had really bad pain and  was nauseous and the sister started to shout at me for not accepting the paracetamol.  I have mental health and know I will be to scared to go again in case they treat  my like this again.  I think these people shouldn’t be looking after patients, if they are not happy with their jobs then they should quit.  For someone to come to hospital there is no need to treat patients like this.  I  would have Understood if they were busy, but the A&E Room was half empty.
NO ONE SHOUD DO THIS JOB IF YOU ARE GOING  TREAT PATIENTS  LIKE THIS WHEN THER ARE IS SO SICK",1
"Out patients services were excellently run. They clearly took efficiency seriously, seemingly having tiered waiting room system, organising people by appointment time and location of appointment (possibly due to limited waiting room spaces, as it's a large out patient facility).

Staff were friendly and the hospital was clean. Only improvement would have been telling patients how the process works in their particular case. On this case I was waiting to see a doctor, then went for a scan, then went back to see the same doctor again. This just ended up being more waiting than I expected. It was fine - I was seen in an appropriate amount of time, but being told about that process would have meant I knew how much time I would be there from the beginning.",5
"Shambolic service. Recommendation to my father in law by his GP to visit A&E as he was complaining about blurred/loss of vision in one eye. Checked in with A&E at 6pm, triaged and then told at midnight that the eye specialist isn't there so will have to come back in the morning.

Next day, 8am scans taken.....6pm eye consultant not sure if scans are conclusive so may need to take further scans....

RIP NHS.....if u can afford it, go private!",1
"Dr Ofinran
Just keep doing what your doing, you are the best in your field and very highly recommended 👌",5
"That old 63 year old midwife is horrible, makes life difficult for both mothers and fathers, she dropped my baby's blood when taking a sample, constant nagging and complaining to both mothers and father and extremely rude. Not fit for the job. Everyone was complaining about her when she left the room. Horrible person.

All the other midwives were very helpful and caring.

I rated as 1* so it gets someone's attention but otherwise 5*.",1
For some reason my comment I made yesterday has been deleted but I will type it again. I can say that the staff who work in the day assessment unit are excellent but unfortunately the same cannot be said for those who work in triage. Came in 10 o clock Saturday and left around 5 o clock disappointed and in utter shock. This is my first pregnancy but it has been very stressful. I went in as I’ve been having reduced fetal movements and the care I had was appalling so in the end I discharged myself and went to the women’s and children’s hospital in Birmingham despite not being able to drive and by the time I got home it was about 10 at night. The midwife didn’t seem to know how to use the huntleigh machine which is better than the old ones as half the time it doesn’t have you sitting there all day. She took me off the ctg about one and didn’t return till about half 4 shouting at me because she told me to hold the transducer if my daughter moved then it obviously needs to be moved every time you pressed the bell they made it seem as if you were some type of burden. As someone who works in the NHS myself compassion goes a long way another thing you should do before even monitoring someone is introduce yourself none of them seemed to do that I get staff shortages and it being challenging but if you can’t handle it then I don’t think you should be working in such a job.,1
Staff were very friendly. Surgery went as smoothly as possible and I had a waiting room all to myself. Everything was clean and there was a to available for every bed (at a cost). Only negatives were they forgot my sick note and said they would post it which I had to follow up on along with some of the car parks; very busy and a bit of a nightmare.,4
"Went the cardiac investigation department back in October 2017, had all the test done on my heart and was told I would get my results back in 6/8 weeks, I didn't here from them at all. We are now in July 2018, I had to ring around to find out what was going on with my results; the receptionist was very rude in how she spoke to me, then I finally get to speak to a secretary of my consultant only to be told by her that my results hadn't been looked at all. Rang a week later and once again I spoke to the consultant secretary and she gave me my results. I'm in shock as to how new Cross run their departments and how they can allow random people in these department to give out information about you without having any contact with the consultant you was under.
I wonder how they would of reacted if I had a heart attack whilst waiting for my results.",1
My wife suffer a fall at home and went to new cross ed she's been in a few days but still in pain on morphine and antibiotics the staff ignored her cries of pain and the physio s were very cold hearted and never listed to her pain issues,2
Gave birth to my 2nd child here in Jan2019. After having a terrible experience at Burton my mind was at ease here at New cross. After a few worrying complications in the last 2 weeks of my pregnancy I was treated with respect and they understood my feelings. My son was delivered free of complications and it was almost an enjoyable experience with thanks to the team at new cross. My husband was treated like a human being instead of just a number (unlike burton) was fed and watered throughout my delivery. Aftercare was great. So friendly and supportive. Was in and out within 24hrs after delivery. The maternity team are a credit to the hospital,5
"Just wanted to thank the amazing Paramedics, who saved the day, when with elderly Lady of 92 she started Choking. If it had not been for their calm advice on the Call and Promote amazing quick arrival in no more than 4 mins.I would have a very different story to tell.
Know how understaffed you are and how hard working the Staff is there
God Bless you and Thank you",5
My daughter gave birth to her little boy and was treated appallingly by the staff. They were rude to her and looked down there noses at her and she had to keep asking over and over again for pain relief. They have lied to her and caused her a great deal of stress and my son was in a different part of the hospital with a bleed on the brain and they messed him about for over a week and made him go through 3 scans which he finds difficult because of the noise from the machine as he's got hydrocephalus. Most the staff lack empathy and have no care for the patients. I will never bring my children to this hospital ever again. I would really like to thank the male nurse Carlos as he was amazing. Treated my daughter with respect and gave her excellent care and listened to her. Pity their isn't a few more nurses like him.,1
Very wonderful place and very nice staff they are helpful people,5
"1 star is too high to even rate. The staff are rude, they just say the wrong things and have horrible attitudes towards those struggling. They do not take mental health seriously so they may as well tell everyone with mental health issues to just “cheer up”. Snobby, stuck up, rude and inattentive.",1
"In the last 12 days I have visited A&E, maxilo, x-ray, CT and been a resident in ward A6 for 5 nights. The hospital is busy but the staff are caring and professional. They always do their best to serve patients needs. Everywhere is immaculately clean, medication is available and protocol is followed. I cannot endorse the excellence of this hospital more.",5
"Excellent staff on ward D7 after having a major operation. Very genuine and caring.. Sister Rup and Sister Rachel really helped me alot with my recovery. Was admitted again after wound opened and still got the same fantastic care. Unfortunately due to my postcode feel let down by aftercare of my vacuum machine. Machine alarming since 6am yesterday morning, went to hospital found a leak. Thought problem was rectified  2 more alarms within the hour saying blockage dressing needs to be changed. No one in that can change the dressing so having to go through a whole day and night of machine alarming every 10 mins so feeling let down by the aftercare of my wound healing. Such a same to have to be negative after such fantastic care 😥😥",4
"I have always gotten excellent medical help from this hospital both in the A&E, and the specialists.  Sometimes it has been a long wait, but always worth it in the end.  They helped my aged mother, my wife and myself in various emergencies, and ongoing specialist  appointments.  Personally I am appreciative of The National Health Service, and hope it evolves in a positive way from now on.  I am pleased that The Wolverhampton Trust has taken management of Cannock Chase Hospital now.",5
"If you will ask one of the worst hospital, then i will give you this hospital's name on first. Such a worst experience ever, with such a slow treatment that you have to wait for 3-4 weeks for just a blood test🤦‍♂️ In such a long span of time just for blood test what if patient gets serious or died?I m waiting from last 2 months for One of my family member who is suffering from illness, but the doctor couldn't find the reason behind her illness, such a disgusting hospital it is.",1
"The staff at this hospital are in one word.....incredible. My husband Jim was admitted through AandE and then transferred to A9 where he underwent emergency surgery and thereafter spent a time in CCU and then A14. The care he received was amazing from beginning to end. It was a very frightening time for my husband, my son and myself who were 278 miles away from home. A very special thanks to Mr Gordon Pereira the surgeon who operated on my husband and saved his life. Without his intervention my husband wouldn't be here. We are now back home and my husband doing well. Huge thank you again to everyone involved in my husbands care.",5
"Sliced my food open on an electric radiator,  2.5hrs wait and 10 stitches later, I'm good as new. The doctors and nurses in urgent care looked tired but they did a very good job.",5
"Absolute joke of a hospital. Went in at 11pm with an open wound after having major surgery, having my stitches out and then the wound opening up. And I've been sitting here for 5 hours and still waiting to be seen. Literally no Dr's around at all.  would bloody die in this place before being seen.",1
"What a brilliant amazing bunch of people, yes I had to wait its no different in any other nhs hospital, but blame that on the tories not the NHS.",5
"I visited the Gynae outpatient clinic for a fats track appointment for my 86 year old mom. The minute I arrived matron Hazel saw I was struggling so got me a wheel chair and helped me through a quicker route. We went straight through and had a ultrasound and asked to wait and see the consultant. The Gyna consultant Mr M Saeed and his team Wendy, Lesley were first class. They found polyps and removed all in this amazing one stop service. Then dear Lesley even helped with the wheel chair after the appointment. Thanks all for a first class service.",5
"Lloyds Lost my prescription, then had to phone my consultant to get another one done, phoned in again to be told it was now ready. Drove the five miles in, then told to sit and wait, and wait………twenty minutes later",2
"Immaculate care from start to finish...Ward C17 in particular took amazing care of everyone on bay 4....I was there for 4 days and the care was impeccable. ..The staff worked none stop,  some back to back shifts....
The wards are very clean and the staff on all shifts were a team....They worked so well together and there was great unity....

Ward C17 staff are a credit to the hospital and Jackie the receptionist went out of her way to help me with an issue the day after my discharge. . .Flawless......",5
"What a crying shame this hospital is. I live in the midlands and was rushed into A & E. I had an emergency operation and my parents and brother drove up from london to see me. They where told maximum of 2 people only? A little bit of common sense could have sufficed, but some little jobsworth made a blatant point of kicking them out!! Bearing in mind there was 6 beds , so room for 12 people?? Some of the staff are briliant, but i just hope one day she suffers the same treatment. I asked staff members her name, but they wouldnt tell me. When i asked to see a senior, nobody got sent.",2
"I had to take my elderly mother to A and E on Wednesday,  the Ambulance crew who came out to her were wonderful, caring and considerate, once at the hospital the same care was given, the nurses and doctors could not have been any better, they were very busy, but nothing was too much trouble, the care mom received was second to none, well done and thank you. The only name I can remember was a nurse called Stella and a doctor who's name started with a P, god bless you all and our wonderful under rated. N H S,",5
"if I could give 0 stars I would. Had an AWFUL woman respond to me over the phone, huffing after everything I said and shouting at me, spelling everything out to me like I was stupid after I requested politely she say it again after she mumbled everything in a “cant be bothered” way. I am a 16 year old girl who just wanted to speak to Family Planning to discuss my birth control arrangements, and with what the stigma around BC, the miserable and judgemental attitude is really just not needed. It made me extremely uncomfortable and upset. I can only think of the effect this would have on girls just going on BC. Clearly your own health is an inconvenience to these phone operators because it would mean that they would actually have to do their job.",1
"Breast Screening Clinic is amazing, all staff so caring, compassionate and helpful.  What was a very stressful time turned into an extremely positive experience.   Our NHS at its very best, well done to all the nurses, radiographers and reception staff.",5
"Absolutely disgusted with my treatment whilst there. I was ignored, lied to, refused pain relief the list goes on.
The only time I felt respected and comfortable in that hospital was when I first arrived for around an hour and then when I was on the delivery suite giving birth, the lady that delivered my child was an angel, she was friendly, professional, helpful and kept me going.
I was lied to whilst on the Triage ward, and in the maternity suite.
There were a few amazing midwives and nurses but the rest were absolutely appauling. I would never recommend New cross to anyone for a birth",1
"Avoid hospital, listen to reviews most of the staff have an attitude and are snobby terrible experience and waiting times that are horrendous 4+ hours sometimes up to 8 for a 5 minute conversation. I even went here at 8pm left at 9am Also I have experienced a 10 hour Waiting time absolute joke of a hospital.",1
"I recently had an operation at New Cross to remove a cancer. I cannot thank all the staff enough for their helpfulness and tireless efficiency, all of whom kept me up to date all of the time as to what was happening and how it was progressing. It was an insight as to what the Nursing Staff have to put up with from members of the public who make it their mission in life to be as awkward and as uncooperative as possible. Even so the Nursing staff did their job in a caring manner for a fraction of the money of other so called over paid professions. Thank you.",5
"I unfortunately fell down the stairs backwards and hit my head. I woke up next day with tingling in arms and legs.  I took a taxi to hospital. No one in waiting room. Taken to a room where my neckwad prodded and ky blood pressure was taken. Nurse said ""don't know where to send you...""
He then sent me upstairs where I waited again.
A doctor then prodded my neck, did the pull/push me tests and said we're concerned about your blood pressure.  (Wouldn't yours be off the scale if you'd fallen downstairs backwards). Said a letter would be at my doctors by time I got home.
I rang doctors who said ""it's probably in the system somewhere""
I'm sure they're very busy 😒",3
"Cleanliness ...?

Considering we’re in the midst of a pandemic - of a virus, cleanliness & hygiene in some departments could improve.   Mother accompanied step-dad to a heart/lung appointment & had to use one of the toilets.   Paper all over the floor, dust & no soap in any of the dispensers.

Misuse of surgical mask - man seen wearing mask on his chin not covering mouth and nose.

Cleaner - mopping floor, but not properly doing so. Half hearted. looked not interested in job.

Some patients have no immune system & would be vulnerable to infection that would result in their death.

I had an op there 12 years ago & the cleanliness / hygiene standards were much better then than they are now, what happened ...?",2
"End of life care here is appalling. Left in a room alone, stale water left all day, nurses callous and uncaring.  What is in patient notes isn’t what happened. This hospital is a disgrace where the nurses really don’t care.  No compassion and they cover each other’s backs for the lies they tell.  They love being able to use covid as an excuse not to visit as they have no one to answer to!  Close it down!",1
I have lived abroad and know what it is like having to pay before you are seen and your in pain. I will never complain about our health care because some countries have none. So I am very grateful to all staff who work in hospitals up and down the country.,5
"The nurses on A7 are lovely caring people Kirsty is an Angel I can't speak highly enough of her.  They all recieve 5 stars. I cant say that about Dr M*******. The hospital rang us and told us my mom did not have long to live and come in straight away. As we entered the ward Dr M******* said get out. We told him the hospital had told us to come in straight away. He said I quote "" I don't care"". By the time we got to see my mom she had died.  Is this I dont care attitude really exceptable from a doctor at New Cross. New cross has posters everywhere saying respect the staff should all staff have the same attitude. This is clearly not the case.",1
Why has my last post been deleted. I have been waiting over a year for surgery my name is Tina sheppard and I am getting stressed. I had my pre op last June but no operation please help,1
"My husband and I attended an ante-natal class yesterday evening, it was absolutely brilliant! The lady who took the class (Kel) made us feel completely relaxed and at ease and I can't believe it was completely free. I would recommend any expectant parents to attend the class which was called 'birth preparation'",5
Recent trip with my 12 year old son to A&E due to continued issue of abdo pain. Waited 2 hours to be triaged then another 2 hours to be seen by a nurse practitioner who diagnosed constipation; no doctor saw my son. Ended up back at hospital 3 days later with confirmed appendicitis from a scan. Walsall Manor were fantastic and took the pain my son was in seriously. I’ve always chosen New Cross as first choice but would rethink next time I need to attend.,2
"New cross has been a huge part of our lives.
Loved ones have gone and little ones have arrived and as we get older we are thankful that this wonderful facility is here for us to use free of charge and keep us alive ,cure our illnesses and give employment to many thousands of people and contribute to the local economy.
It could always be better, parking problems will always persist,food will never be the best but these are minor things to consider in the bigger picture of keeping you alive and well and being able to continue enjoying your family and life.",5
"I've had experience of quite a few hospitals in this country over the years, and New Cross rates as the best so far. I've read some bad reviews about NX on here, and from my own experiences I can't say they are warranted. It is not the hospitals fault if you are depressed or bored while there, staff aren't there to entertain you. The people putting those types of comments need to have a word with themselves. Also, people complaining about parking need to realise its the same all over, that comes from my experience too. My mother is in the hospital after being very poorly and she has been cared for extremely well. The staff are experienced, competent, concientious and nothing is too much for them, the hospital is spotless, other general staff friendly and accomodating. One trolley lady even did my mums hair for her... The way this government is attempting to ruin the NHS its a wonder any of the above mentioned is possible. Staff shortages and lack of funds are squeezing our NHS to the Max, yet you wouldn't know that from the everyday workings and actions of staff at NX. People complaining should remember this. Our NHS is free at point of contact, it mightn't be that way forever if this government has its way, you'll have far more to worry and moan about then. I'm happy to recommend New Cross Hospital to anyone, and I say thank you very much to them for caring so well for my mum.",5
"BIG HOSPITAL AND ONLY ONE DR WORKING !!! (as if)
Dont even deserve 1 star at all,
A&E worst hospital ever u wait there 6 hours just for doctors to say u need to take paracetamol those doctors take one patient every 2-3 hours and people are there like 20+ and only one doctor working there big shame they dont care about people",1
"I have taken my little daughter to this hospital on 3 occasions now.
On each visit i have had to wait for 3-4 hours after which the doctors are not very friendly and dont want to listen to your issues.
Instead they just prescribe painkillers which i could have brought over the counter without doing any decent checks.
Disgrace",1
"I was in this hospital from the 25th june to the 5th july in this time i had high blood pressure and hellp syndrome. I had my baby via emergency c section  on the 30th june 8 weeks early from my due date, i cant fault any of the staff there they all looked after me well. I cannot fault the staff that work in the neonatal unit.",5
"Probably one of the worst hospitals in the UK. My Grandad died because of a ""i cant be bothered"" attitude and from medical neligence. Staff havent a clue and they all think they are better than you because they work for the medical profession. Dont make me laugh!! you all need to go back and re-sit your degrees as you do not have the capabilities of being a doctor/nurse etc. AMU, A8 and C16 disgrace. My Grandad would still be here if they did not discharge him and when he went back for the 3rd time they told us he wont be making it back home. This hospital needs to be closed down. We work and pay our taxes and this is how they treat their patients.",1
"Had my tonsils out yesterday, A16 Appleby suite. Becky, Julie and all the other nurses were fantastic. Martina and her team of anaesthetists, the man who took me to the anaesthetist was a pleasure with great humour which put me at ease. The operating ENT consultants were also fantastic. They were all very clear with me and answered all my questions. I was given pain relief when I felt it became too uncomfortable and whilst still sore as can be expected, it helped enormously. Thank you all. I really appreciate the genuine care you all showed to me yesterday.",5
"Please check how many reviews each reviewer has made. The 1 star reviews appear to be from people with strange usernames who have made only one or two reviews.

In my experience and opinion I can report on excellent care for my mom who was rushed in by ambulance. Witnessed the thorough care of the nurses and doctors myself. Thank you.",5
"My friend went in via ambulance with a loss of blood issue, which is no good for anyone, specially If they suffer from thinned blood. All night, my friend was constantly bleeding, needing dressing changes (only one change given) and what they decided was to send my friend home saying it's a infection. I even phoned up the A&E department after seeing the photos of the issue and my friend being constantly dizzy and unwell, I worried too much. The lady on the phone was nice enough. No medicaton given, and sent away. My friend as come out of the hospital literally still ""pissing"" out of blood with blood drenched clothes and has not sorted out what they went in for. When my friend had asked for a complaints form they turned around and said there were none in stock. Either you have a lot of complaints or somebody was lying about there being no forms. Going through NHS PALs instead.

Then again what would you expect, I lost my grandmother because they screwed up her operation of removing a cancerous tumor from the pancreas and caused a infection that actually caused her death. Then they had the nerve to say it was pneumonia!

Absolutely appalling service.",1
Phoned this hospital today  to get through to a doctor and was on hold for what seemed like ages.The call handler does not introduce  themself -i was eventually given a call handler's name when i asked a couple of times .As she did not listen to my query she ended up transferring me to the wrong part of a clinic.Another call handler then asked me about my query and gave me another number and mentioned that they have many calls waiting so needed to be quick . Maybe someone needs to look at improving this service.,1
Terrible service in the heart and lung department! My nan came in for scheduled surgery today to be turned away even though the hospital phoned last night and asked her to come in early. How horrible to prepare yourself mentally for heart surgery for it then to be cancelled. This hospital needs to sort out patient care and well-being!,1
"My Wife broke her shoulder 3 weeks ago, I can honestly say that the care she has received from the A and E department and also the fracture clinic has been 1st class.
Everyone has been so supportive and kind.. Thank you so much NHS.",5
"What a terrible place! Taxes being wasted on this, don’t have one good thing to say about this hospital. My grandma was taken to new cross in an ambulance as she lost her appetite, couldn’t walk properly, was abit clueless as to what was going on and didn’t even recognise her own family. She had multiple tests done, but the nurses couldn’t even tell us what tests were done, what medication she was on, and just didn’t know what was going on with the patients most of the time. As this was Christmas time, they decided to discharge my grandma a week after she was taken to New Cross, but she wasn’t ready to be discharged as she still wasn’t eating properly and was still not 100% with what was going on around her and still couldn’t properly. To add to this, they couldn’t even tell us why my grandma was like this, and didn’t even bother telling us results of any tests, the doctors and nurses are useless, get some better qualified doctors in there who actually know what they are doing!!!!! About 2 weeks later after she was discharged, my grandma suffered a stroke and was taken to the QE hospital in Birmingham where she was properly looked after and treated so well, cannot fault the QE, the staff are lovely and do everything they can for patients. Sadly my grandma is no longer with us, but she still could be here if New Cross never discharged her in the first place, absolutely disgusting hospital!",1
"My son was on c15 he was there for 4 months
Worst ward ever staff just sit around
Didn't listen to my son sadly he passed away
Then my dad was at the hospital told my dad he had 2 to 3 days to live
The consultant couldn't wait till someone was with my dad to tell him
I wouldn't recommend this hospital at all",1
Well been sent to new cross for the walking cos they don’t have doctors there anymore and it is around 4-6 hour wait piss take should be closed down and that’s the new out of hours Doctors up stairs they have 2 Doctors on and what looks like over 80 people hear as well. They didn’t believe that I have different illness as well had to tell them who I was under in the hospital and I think they phone her as well cos they didn’t believe me 😂 time to close it down as it is a waste of time going to the walking centre at new cross but new cross it self is not that bad once you make it passed A and E,1
My grandad came out of hospital severely dehydrated and malnourished  after not being looked after for two weeks in the hospital he is now in a care home and he’s being very well looked after he’s came out of hospital worse then he went in… If there was a zero star rating I would choose Rudi age 11,1
"Had a hernia repair here on 14/09/15. From the initial contact to being discharged from day surgery all I came across was a highly professional team of people who where also kind and compassionate.

"I've only recently had a minor stroke and well first I press the buzzer for nurse to come help me but 1hour later it's to late, 2 I've told the doctors about the pills I've had and I said I have 2 to make 40 on the night. These nurses I've seen today 24th Oct 2020 were absolutely disgusting. I said would you let an old man wipe his backside by himself and they said yes, really disgusting they ignore you. When I told that nurse clearly my gp put me on 40 flumoxatine she gave me 1 didn't give me the other she has not returned",1
"I was admitted into newcross on the 9th April after visiting accident and emergency. I had a ct scan and was diagnosed with a bleeding and swollen brain.
I spent two weeks after in the renal ward while waiting for a bed to be available at the Q E in Birmingham to have a tumour removed from my brain which was the reason for the bleeding and swelling.
I cannot give enough praise to all the staff who looked after me while I was in Newcross, there skill and commitment to patients.
The biggest surprise to me was the abuse the staff take from rude and ungrateful patients, this abuse would not be accepted in any other environment or work situation.",5
"Went in after referral from a walk in centre due to excrutiating stomach pains. Brilliant doctors advising me on what to do, advised to come back for a scan and case open for 10 days. Return to very rude staff, accused of being a liar 4 times and told to get a referral. Had to go to A&E at another hospital to seek treatment. I went there for help at the end of the day and they wouldnt offer any.",1
"Horrifyingly poor care. Wife was in a lot of pain and kept passing out a day after being admitted for gall bladder problems - took the hospital EIGHT HOURS to get a dr to see her. We requested a dr as a matter of urgency at 7:15pm, and she was eventually seen in the early hours of Saturday morning.

Staff have practically accused her of lying when she'd brought this up to me.

And what about something as simple as getting a fluids IV going, one that she was told she needed? Surely that couldn't take too long? How about almost three hours??

The whole experience has been nightmarish.",1
"Actually evefything fine about pregnancy etc but...

With any injuries waiting time for ANYBODY is horrible.

Completely AVOID this place if you wanna stay alive.",1
"I saw THREE PEOPLE WRITHING ON THE FLOOR IN A&E IN AGONY AND all STAFF DISMISSIVE, pretending that they weren't there.

For us personally, when inquired, the receptionist said that there were almost 200 people in front of my daughter - who was visibly in excruciating pain.

Not fit for purpose - say goodbye to the NHS.

I'd like a little rant about the car parking facilities (or rather, lack of and charges) but heyho!  Does our opinion here mean anything???

My advice - see a vet, I've seen more compassion shown to my Jack Russell.",1
"I came in on Saturday 5/4 for tests to take place, I attended the Beyon Centre Endoscopy unit, the staff managed to make an unpleasant experience almost pleasant,  everyone was kind and looked after me  well as I was nervous and unhappy about what i was going to have done to me.  Everyone who spoke to me was very professional and kept me informed about what would happen and what to expect.  I would just like to thank them all again.",5
I'm writing this whilst everything is fresh in my mind and life and it's obligations doesn't take over. myself and my family would like to thank the staff in resus of the A&E dept.  My father suffered multiple brain haemorrhages yesterday morning whilst at home. Sadly he died early hours of this morning . He had by this time been moved to a ward for end of life care. We wish to thank resus staff particularly for the sensitive and empathetic way both my father and ourselves were treated. I am myself a nurse working mainly in palliative care so not only did they have to deal with a distressed family but also myself . Thank you  from the bottom of our hearts.,5
"I've just recently had my baby at New Cross and cannot praise the staff enough for all their help along the way. I was induced and so was given a lovely room where I the process began. The midwives were all plesant got me started off swiftly. I was then moved to a delivery room where a lovely lady called Meng got me prepped for an epidural and saw me through until about 8pm. Meng was kind and supportive, holding my hand and talking me through the painful parts. I was very great full for this and something as small as holding someone's hand can make all the difference 😊 Mengs shift finished and another fabulous midwife called Preeti took over and saw me through until the end. Preeti was excellent and so in control of everything, I felt that she understood my needs and was very accommodating throughout my time with her. Lastly, once on the ward to rest, all the staff again were very helpful and friendly, making me feel relaxed and comfortable. I was discharged by 7pm and the midwife Emma arranged all of my paperwork to enable us to leave straight away. All in all a great experience and I cannot praise New Cross enough for their services and staff 😊",5
"Went to A&E after fainting for the 2nd time blah blah. Over all i was delt with,WITH IN 4 hours. There was lots of patients in and out and being delt with swiftly. The doctors and nurses id seen were fab, i was on my own so a little ""dazed"" and they made sure i understood everything they were doing and what was going on, one even had a good sense of humour.. all very very polite staff.",4
"Just stop and think before you judge you are not the only person in this hospital.  I ended up in cardiology with a minor compliant. I was treated like I could drop down dead at any second until they could prove otherwise. I was in for seven days and bored to death, this is NOT a compliant this is praise the health care assistants were as good as the nurses, the nurses as good as the doctors and the doctors were out of this world,  We have in the midlands a heart and lung department to be proud of and should shout about it. I was in B14 and spent time in high care B4 and B6 the wards are so clean and I am OCD clean. The surfaces were cleaned daily, the bed sheets changed daily, the bathroom floors have separate mops and buckets to the ward floors . I waited for uncleanness there is NONE. A lot of people complained about waiting for procedures.... again stop and think how many people are in this place. If you are not happy waiting a couple of days doing nothing and being waited on hand and foot discharge yourself and wait months for an out patient appointment you might die...stupid. This is turning into a rant but let me go on please.... the food......I had very low expectations but hang on let me describe the day. You are woken up to a drink,  tea, coffee, juice as you take it. Next breakfast,  cereal,  toast,  jam, marmalades.  Mid morning, more hot drinks and always fresh water delivered to you in a jug with measures for you to understand a healthy intake, come on they are helping you to hydrate.  Lunch comes with choices, salads, sandwiches and a choice of hot meals and a desert mostly healthy but all small enough to fall into the correct calorific value for the day. Afternoon hot drinks then an evening meal similar to lunch,  you have many choices and again more hot drinks before bed. Oh....the bed by the way the mattresses are over a grand each and mould to your body shape and weight so you don't get bed sores..........think....think ........think before you moan Mr and Mrs ungrateful its all FREE this is not the good old US of A the land of plenty where you get nothing unless you pay up, this is good old blighty.   Thank you new cross, thank you cardiology department, sadly I have to go back to finish my treatment but at least I know I am in good hands, I will be kept clean, safe, warm and fed healthily and above all I know I am going back to the best cardiology unit in the world.
Just a final note if you rate this hospital just on its parking then you are a short sighted, in the future should we build a smaller hospital just so we can make more car parking spaces for the healthy people who choose to be lazy at the expense of sick people who once treated in a great hospital like this would be greatfull to take a short walk? Come on think a little......",5
Partner had a go cart incident at 40 MPH and discharged her with query spinal injury no scans where taken,1
Got rushed in at 19.30 by ambulance got woke up by a doctor at 4.20 am told to sit in waiting area I have mobility problems docter said I don't qualify for the amber line I struggle to walk a few steps it took my partner 8 hours who is also disabled to get me home receptionists talking and joking around instead of answering the phone and the ward sister spoke rudley to me when I asked for help all I had was a coat and pyjamas nothing else unsympathetic staff worst hospital I have been to.,1
It was absolutely terrible. Had to wait for more than 4 hours with chest pain and low heart beat. Felt absolutely ignored and disappointed. People came after me were served before me by giving different excuses which didn't have nothing to do with their illness. I have been told that I am next and will be called when the doctor will be available but not surprised that other people been called instead of me. Would prefer to die than going back to new cross. Absolutely disgusting.,1
"Opportunity -
Only issue for me is the parking at this hospital it’s so bad they don’t have enough spaces for the amount of cars coming to this hospital each day took so long to find a car park space sometimes so far to where we need to go great hospital for care Bad for parking",2
Heart and lung dept cannot fault. Everyone pleasant hard working and helpful. Car parking not cheap  but weekly pass is good idea. Don't think my dad could have had better care.,5
"I am undergoing chemotherapy at present all doctors,nurses,health care and domacillary staff are wonderful nothing is to much trouble.",5
"Grateful thanks to ambulance crew, A&E staff and all staff on ward C21 who took such wonderful care of my brother-in-law. The staff were very caring and professional and made a terrifying situation so much easier to cope with.",5
Lots of great staff here who all work so hard.  They did great work with my nan. Some depts aren't as good as others in the way of cleanliness/their ability to deal with people with dementia (even though it was the elderly ward).,4
I went to a & e a few weeks with serious bad chest pain and I had to wait 7 hours to be seen by staff very disgraceful,1
"Amazing, helpful staff who honestly couldn't do enough for you. Went in for day surgery on the 29th January, I was very apprehensive about having surgery but the staff were very understanding and put my mind at ease. Thank you to all the staff on the Beynon Unit for looking after me.",5
"Where 2 Even Begin..The Staff Are Rude And Appear Not To Know What They Are Doing.My 4 Year Old Got Taken In A&E Due To Falling On A Dirty Broken Glass Bottle Kneck Which Caused A Laseration On His Back...The Ambulance Cleaned Him Up And Bandaged Him Until We Got There..When We Did The Nurse Who Treated Him Didnt Have A Clue What She Was Doing Had 2 Keep Getting Advice Or Confirmation Off Another Dr Who Again Didnt Seem 2 Know Properly..My Boy Wasnt Treated Properly At All..We Ended Up Going 2 The Manor The Following Day Due 2 The ""Glue"" The Nurse Had Used Had Popped Open Through Out The Previous Day Or Night Causing It To Become Infected..Luckly The Staff At The Manor Iodined His Wound And Sterra Stripped Him And Gave Him The Antibiotics He Should Of Been Prescribed After The Poor Attempt Of Treatment By NX",1
"Despite not looking forward to going to the fracture clinic, my thoughts were put to rest, by the team there, thanks to Brian who put my new cast, on, he was a nice friendly happy chappie, made the time I was there a pleasure, was seen quickly too, thanks to all the staff at the clinic",5
"I was treated in a hospital in the fourteenth city in the UK as it would not be in the best private hospital in the capital of my country. Each person will have their different experience and when we are sick believe that one of the most important things is the good will , because the competence or skill are not enough if you do not like people , it's like love in a marriage of convenience.",5
"20th august i went to this hospital .the reception man was really rude and disrespect to me , i was really bad situation with early pregnant bleeding , nurse sent me to same day immegency care, 5 hourse i was waiting see the doctors and see my results , very bad paining my lower belly , finally miscarrage my chiled and they havent done anything , still i am waiting for my scan , worses hospital i ever seen my life time , i never go there and never recomand anyone and if i can i give thousand zero for this hospital .",1

"Good A&E department and staff, along with paramedics. Fast service as prolonged seizure. Very understanding and informtive, plus ample parking for family as needed. One of the better hoslitals I  have had an unplanned visit too.",5
Sat in A n E waiting to be seen everyone that come in after me has been seen im in alot of pain witch i told the staff they didnt seem botherd and im still waiting to be seen its a joke just gone up to the counter to get a sick bowl and ask how long its going to be a ppl that just come on are going a head of me im in so much pain but this hospital does not care,1
"Attended New Cross Hospital Eye Infirmary for the first time yesterday.   The staff and consultant could NOT possibly have treated me better.   Fed up with hearing how dire our NHS is, so I felt
the need to voice my personal views.",4
Used to be an amazing hospital and a and e service. Used to is the key part. It has gone utterly downhill the only sanitised things are probably the Greggs counter at a push. There was blood in the elevator and it wasn't even sanitised it was wiped with a wet mop. No wonder hospitals are full if they're not being cleaned properly and epidemics can hold entire cities in fear if the places that treat them are writhing in bacteria. However some departments are kept clean and have had some good experiences with the children's ward and their staff being absolutely wonderful. A shame that some of the departments mainly a and e are making a bad name for new cross as a whole.,2
Parking is terrible. Cars parked on double yellow lines and grass verges. The ward I visited smelt horrible.,2
we make apointment  15:15 we arrive on time and they told us you have to wait 2.5 hours. Around so many people sick after that many ahours easy to make your self sick so we left. whats the point pay every month for incurence over 100 pounds if when you need wait 2.5h ahours,1
Absolutely shocking. 4 hours so far and not even called to triage yet.. Squashed finger between fork lift fork and an engine. Split and broke.. Only wanted a stitch so can get back to work.. I'll super glue it.. Place is complete joke..,1
"Really friendly staff and great level of care for my wife recently. Slightly confusing parking system. Free for 20 minutes then it's £2. Unsure whether to enter registration number in system if under 20 minutes. TVs for every bed, which work out at £5 a day. Or just go prepared with iPad and a shed load of data.",5
"Over the past six years, we have received excellent treatment and care in the following departments - urology, eye infirmary, dermatology, maxillo facial and orthopaedic. The practitioners have amazed us with their skill, particularly in theatre and after care.",5
been new cross .Staff and coffee shop lovely. Parking staff helpful when I got their gave me their number to phone on return home to pay great no problem at all. Great experience all round .,5
"If i could give zero starts i would like they not even worth a star , took my child to A&E and took 7 hours to get back home made me wait all that time and keep saying doctors coming every hour while i could hear the nurses laughing, joking , flirting and listening to music all night . Unprofessional i would avoid going new cross forever in my life",1
Obviously has its ups and downs it's a hospital that caters to a large mass of people daily. That being said I've been in an out over the years from age 16 (now 26 as of writing) and I've never had an issue apart from one occasion this doesn't reflect the overall care and treatment which is what people seem to be forgetting and not only that it seems common these days that people if don't get what they want even if it's in their best interests they'll complain and make up a story.,4
"My son was admitted to the children's ward today for a routine operation and I really can't rate the service we received enough! Thankyou so much to all the nurses, doctors and aneathetists we came into contact with today, you were all brilliant.",5
Just spoke to a lovely lady on B14 ward cardiology her name was sue and she was so helpful and caring I know how busy this ward is but nothing was too much trouble for this lovely lady thankyou so much,5
Hate it doctors are awful  digusting my dad was a heart patient don't take no quick reaction. And they said the operation will take an hour and it took them 5 hours after cpuple of hours he passed away which i definitly know they made a mistake. Lost my dad useless doctors.,1
"NHS hospital full of helpful doctors and nurses all trying to make our lives better. They've certainly succeeded with me, although I would be the first to admit that I'm not the best example to others :) In Feb 2019 I had an impacted wisdom tooth removed. The names Margarita Pracatan and .... Cleo Rocos were instrumental in making me laugh out loud during the procedure :)",5
Incompetent liers that think it's OK to augue to patients with heart problems to wind them up even more.attitude stinks of the day nurses who slag patients off in front of other patients. I have had keep trying to trace medication that my husband really needs.I will be taking this further !!!,1
"I presented at A and E with chronic lower abdomen pain, a senior doctor assessed me and discharged me on the basis that I had wind!!!  I collapsed on the hospital grounds was bought back in and re-assessed only to be told I had 2 cysts!!!  Senior doctor!!!  Disgusting.",1
"I would like to say a massive Thank-you to Jenny Busby for the fast response and support to my partner Sharon Meanley since having her operation with Mr Isgar, The professionalism and after care support She has received from yourself has been amazing , I could never Thankyou enough in how you have got Sharon back on the road to recovery with your support, keep doing what you do because you are amazing, Also Thankyou to Mr Isgar for your care during the operation,",5
"I was seen by my gp late last year's having endured over 25 years of angina. I was recommended to New Cross in January and   Wednesday 24th May 2016 I had a triple bypass at the grand old age of 51. Tomorrow I will be discharged to go home😊.

The professional and confident team led by Mr Yiu was exemplary and gave me the option to live or die.

I will be forever grateful to these beautiful people who gave me the courage to trust their sterling work. Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital I am sincerely humbled .",5
"Absolutely disgusting attitude from the ladies on the phone. We have been trying to rebook an appointment for nearly 3 days now. Text service is down. Appointment department never ever answer the phone. Called outpatient department direct they put me back to the appointment line. After 42 minutes being on hold, the line gets cut off.
Then they have the nerve to complain about people not rearranging appointments.",1
My daughter was attended to nicely,5
"Quite good, parking a bit of a nightmare",4
"Taken care of my son for nearly 18 years now,with his illness,Can not fault them in anyway.Also birthed all my three children here.",5
"From referral by GP to surgery, waiting time was minimal. Excellent care on all occasions to hospital including day of surgery and after. Special Thanks to Paediatric Orthopaedic Consultant Mr Phillips and team, theatre 10 (orthopaedic)team including Dr I Jones (Anaesthetist) also paediatric ward team and paediatric outpatients clinic team. Very one made my surgery and recovery period a memorable one.kudos guys",5
I had to have z 30 minute Covid test. Then queue to find Ward I needed then ask the way to the ward. Good job I got there early. But this adds to parking bill.,4
"Some nurses are heroes, some are not. It should be a place of healing. Its just a cold and lonely dirty drafty place with horrible staff, and a bed thats half made.",2
When I got there first with ambulances they were great when I got to the ward in a5 to bad I was so bored and some of the staff was little bit rude. I was there 4 days I just wanted to get from that place I would not recommend this place to no 1. I was going to work I fell from the top stairs and I came rolling down. And new cross hospital is so depressing.,1
"Attended Appleby ward for a lumpectomy . I would like thank all the staff for their care .from my lovely consultant ,receptionist nurses and everyone who made my stay of a few hours comfortable even though it was a long wait for my op .my God you all work so hard bless you.",5
A&E staff are a complete waste of time. Was told I had to wait 6 additional hours after already waiting for 4 to be seen about my foot and lower leg which was and still is in excruciating pain.,3
No one was even after us. Father was with the cracked open head.  Bin waiting for too long. Nurse was less than polite at the desk. No one cared after us just the ambulance staf. Huge thanks to them.,1
Have been a patient since 2012 in different departments but mainly dermatology the staff are absolutely lovely. and very helpful and caring. nothing is too much trouble if you have concerns or a problem.,5
"I would give it no stars! There is no words to describe how awful this place it. Issues: cleanliness , attitudes , empathy , care the list is endless. I do not recommend this hospital. This is a waste of land and money. You am meant to be a hospital for god's sake!!!",1
"my elderly mom has been left in pain, in A&E for over 12 hours and she has severe multiple illnesses, left over night to suffer. Covid or no Covid this is unacceptable.",1
I have always been impressed by NX and the heart and lung centre must be a centre of European excellence. Its a pity the old guard of brilliant ex Royal consultants are slowly returning to their gardens ! We will miss the incomparable Mr Jackson from renal.,4
"Arrived in plenty of time for my appointment only to be told it had been cancelled.  No explanation no apologies just the computer says it was cancelled. When asked why I hadn't been sent notification or a new appointment i was told to talk to pals as this was happening all the time.
It's disgusting. They harp on about missed appointments but never say anything about increased waiting times or cancelled appointments due to their inadequacies.",1
I had a absces under a TOOTH whilst on lockdown I was referred to NHS pennfields dental services which was well run safe and the staff did an excellent job at removing the bad tooth they extracted it that easy I could drive home thanks again to the pennfields staf and NHS,5
"After a brief unexpected illness and quick diagnosis staff are awesome, patient and tentative, nothing is too much trouble",5
"Rude doctor, would not examine the place where i had surgery, as I felt it may have been infected
Staff do not communicate with one another, they had no idea why I was at the hospital
Extremely poor service
Was in A&E for chest pains
Arrived 1am and left at 11am
Was already very poorly due to surgery.
The worst experience ever!!!",1
Your nurses in the maternity department are the reason a poor innocent baby was born sleeping due to your maternity teams failure in your duty of care for both mum and baby. Blood is on your hospitals hands I hope they sue your trust!,1
Went to new cross hospital and was very nervous. Saw dr and was told everything and a bit more. Very helpful. Very clean. Lovely staff. Just a bit complicated on the maps.,5
"Dont like to be critical of nurses but the ones in the Durnell unit seem to not want be there.
The overweight ones constantly moan about the workload instead of getting on with their job, they leave patients waiting for ages for simple procedures like fitting a canula when i was there it took a really nervous nurse 4 attempts.I heard one caring nurse say that one patient had been waiting a long time to be seen to and the other nurse replied thats ??? patient let her deal with him.",1
"Cancer care here is brilliant, staff are amazing. Even though I have moved home to another Trust area I am continuing to travel the 30 miles to stay in the care of my surgeon and oncologist.",5
"my daughter was falsely diagnosed for an ailment which turned out to be cancer,she received treatment and now ok but had so many ""botched"" attempts to cure kidney problems and I am more than dis-satisfied!
her name is Kelly kesete and as  I speak hospitalised again instead of pain killers cant you make her well!?!
a dis gruntled father",3
"Angry, upset and scared. Grandson aged 3 ,nasty bang in-between eyes on corner of kitchen worktop. Very disoriented,in pain and crying,wanting to sleep and eyes unfocused. Took New Cross A&E, totally fobbed off. Because no mark or bruise totally unconcerned and sent home without proper examination. Absolutely disgusted that a child can be treated like this. Angry and upset Nan.",1
"Stayed at the hospital for 2 days to have a operation,some of the nicest staff they have on ward from the nurses to the doctors and the anaesthetic doctors,made me feel at ease throughout my stay,ever do grateful for the treatment i received.",5
"During labor... I was there less than 30mins when they noticed something wasn't right, I was taken straight into theater... they saved my sons life and made sure I was okay too and the after care has been brilliant",5
"Went in for day surgery all the nurses made my stay comfortable and pain free, Doctors were brilliant and soon sorted me out i was discharged by the afternoon and had home recovery",5
"Maybe retrain reception staff in A&E. I asked for a wheelchair as disabled after being told the chairs were in A&E and there wasn't any, and was told by the young girl she couldn't help and I would have to look for one. No offer of help and needs to learn some manners.",3
Those working in healthcare should care about people. They should have manners and empathy- When people visit hospital they are often vulnerable or in pain- This hospital is far from the best!,2
"Had an appointment today with the dermatology department, I was dealt with promptly, and I was very happy with the outcome (minor surgery) can't compliment all the staff highly enough. Many Thanks.",5
Dr Obi in urgent care is the most fantastic doctor I have ever come across. Brilliant with children...What a credit to NHS .. thank you Dr Obi..  Jamie (chicken pox box),5
"I was there with very big pain , I’ve burned mi foot grade 2 very bad , they left me on the chairs to wait for 4-half hours , with very big pain , i didnt wait , after 5 hours i left the hospital with very big pain and they was repeated to me they are very busy i dont recommend to any one better go to private clinic 👌",1
"Worst experience ever
After 11 hours stayed there with my son who was in bad condition send us home with no diagnostic.
No medications provided no test nothing
At new cross hospital are no doctors for kids only nurses with no qualifications.
If anyone need to go at hospital don't go there you will end more ill .",1
"Greay hospital with excellent care. After appendicitis i recovered quickly with the fantastic aftercare of all the nurses and doctors. Cannot thank them enough for all they did for me , recommended hospital. Excellent care !",5
"Amazing hospital and staff, very professional and caring but with a kind reassuring approach which puts you at ease especially when you just put a trampoline spring through your hand.

A BIG HEARTFELT THANKYOU ♥️♥️",5
Came into A&E today and waited over 7hrs today to be seen by a doctor absolutely disgusting NHS service.... Not sure what we are paying taxes for!!!!,1
I will never ever go back to new cross maternity they treated me terrible when I was in early labour for my son who I lost god rest baby but the neonatal unit is the best ever i love all the the they was with me and my family they done wonders with my tiny princess who was 4 mths early now she's 1 in 3 weeks xx,1
"Not the newest, most modern hospital out there, but it gets the job done. The waiting times could be improved, but the staff are friendly and they'll go above and beyond to help.",3
"Lung and heart unit saved my dad's life an I will be forever grateful for them doing so and the weeks he was here the staff were amazing surgeons,consultants, nurses and health care did a fab job for my dad and the after cares be grate too",5
"My granddaughter was taken to A and E today, to the children's side was sent upstairs to the walk in, where it seems they are sending everyone from A and E, told it was a 7hours wait  and it has now gone up to 9 hours, this is disgusting way to leave little kids waiting this long.",1
Only gave 3 stars as the staff are excellent but the parking is absolutely shocking,3
"I sometimes get nose bleeds and had to go to Zone A A25 and saw Mr Barraclough, I had never been here before and was very pleased with my care, the staff were lovely although I had a game finding the pharmacy, running all over the hospital must've lost some calories but found it eventually, I'm no good at finding my way lucky I don't drive but overall - very pleased and Mr Barraclough was a lovely fellow.",5
"First time i had been to this hospital, the department I had to go to were very helpful and efficient. The car parking is horrendous, so my advice would be to go at least an hour earlier than your appointment to find a space",4
"Admitted sat 1/2/20 due to minor heat attack, not the first one that was a major one due to blocked artery, the staff in A+E were fantastic, moved to M A U where the care was very good, the moved same night to heart and lung centre where the treatment and care received is still second to none rate the unit 10/10 any time staff on wards friendly, doctors, nurses, and consultants were amazing what more can I say, my experience under the circumstances cannot be faulted even though the NHS is struggling for bed space and staff 👍👍👍👍👍",5
"Nobody knows what's going on !! They say one thing then do another... lost faith in the place completely.
Sent home with no mediation after being in there for 4 days ... really not good at all.",1
I'm angry that I had to give 1 star as no stars is not an option. Might aswell of went to my shop keeper and asked him to treat me. Diagnosis would of been alot faster and probably more accurate. Clowns,1
"Highest concentration of Gregg’s Bakeries anywhere in the world…..
You can’t move for the pasties….
You walk down a corridor and all of a sudden there’s a Gregg’s.
I was late for my appointment as I was seduced by the meal deals.",5
"Had heart problems and cannot thank all the nurse's, doctors.catering etc...new valve fitted etc...special thanks to the whole team on B14 cardiac ward...exellect care thank God for our NHS...",5
"Great hospital came here to have a pilonidal cyst removed, nurses are friendly and professional, I felt comfortable throughout.",5
Bit confusing to find your way around but once you’re in it’s okay. Had positive experience with staff that helped me and got treatment I needed. There is a greggs and WH Smith shop inside and vending machine for snacks.,4
Staff were 9 out of ten very good specialy philipino lady nurse JOY. I thank everyone to go through all that with me. Love you all. Don't like the food there. Sorry,4
Hospital good. Parking diabolical! ! We queued for 30 mins to park but couldn't get a space so drove home to Stafford without having visited sick relative. Fuming!!!!,4
"The parking at this hospital is an abomination, and the charges are extortionat  the chances of you being less than two hours to be seen are non existent  a poorly run hospital with staff that have a lack of interest in some cases this seems to be the future of the NHS",1
Great hospital  staff are lovely,5
"Dire experience. Complete waste of time,.",1
"Shocking end of life care, no support for the patient who has now waited over 15 hours for a doctor to materialise - no medication provided or anything to support the patient or make them more comfortable",1
Love this hospital one of the best around 🙂 had my daughter there and there were so loving and caring 🙂 the food is nice as well and the nurses are lovely!! Looked after me brilliantly 🙂,5
hi my wife had our son at this hospital on 9th september 2020 she been in there 13 days now they left her on 10th september without a drink for 5hrs she kept asking for a drink but they never came back with one,1
I have been coming hear for the past 9 years due to my mother and she's always saying how comfortable she feels hand how the staff are always helpful grated you get the odd one who probably doesn't want to be there and can be a bit rude but that's not exactly the hospitals fualt they are and all round good hospital that I wouldn't mind being in if I had to have anything done,5
"Worst experience ever!
Brother in law was referred there because of high pressure into one of his eyes. He got conjucttivirus infection from there. It's been 3 weeks now and my whole family and close relatives are suffering from conjunctivitis. It's shame when even little kids are suffering from it because of poor health and hygiene conditions of hospital.",1
"Carparks are a nightmare, hospital itself was OK but way to big and confusing signage which adds to stress when your already not in the best of situations. Staff very friendly and helpful though.",2
The laid back on the care of stoma patients my husband was sent home without any removal spray he as to take it of manual which it hurts when pulling your hairs off,1
My partner has been throwing up for three weeks now she hasn't eaten in 6 days can't walk without becoming dizzy she had a MRI scan 4 days ago which nobody can get hold off she got referred to newcross today by her gp to be placed in care on a drip only to sit there 6 hours to be sent home as theres no beds NHS is a joke on your head be it if something happens to her mark my words now I'm not blaming the staff I'm blaming the country we've got one of the highest tax brackets in the world but can't get simple care disgrace,1

Samantha bullen",5
"Worst place ever, get taken in by ambulance and told wait no longer than 30 mins here I am now 4 hours later still waiting cause apparently 'other people's illnesses take priority over others'
Oh sorry didn't know a guy with a common cold is worse than a guy who was vomiting blood. Great job guys. Thanks.",1
IM still in hospital  again  When I had major surgery  I was left in chronic pain for 2 and half hours because there were not enough staff I  find it bloody disgusting  that such a big hospital  has such little staff at night time list goes on I'm afraid.,1
They treat patients horribly with rude language. This is a not a hospital. They don't give any importance to non emergency cases.,1
Have no complaints considering the difficult situation and government neglect of NHS. (Transparent patient),5

The nurses and doctors are very plesant and ready to help if they are not to busy my stay in january in c18 was a good stay and im back in there now i praise them all doing a good job.,5
The only people that answer the phone at this place are the switchboard and are the only people that don’t have a bad attitude. You would have more of a chance getting through to the Queen of England and she’s dead,1

Nice facilities but worst set up. 4hrs waiting time for a non busy night. My patient is crying and screaming but no body cares except other patients.needs a proper review.,1
It's well worth the extra 30 minute drive to get to the QE hospital in Birmingham - This A&E department is non-functional,1
A lot better then what it was fair few years ago when it never had the resources that it as got know good what every NHS does for all British people...,5
I have to call Ambulance for my husband.Ambulance no was 4734.crew was Chelsea and Daniel.They both provide 5 🌟 service.,5
[A&E] Absolutely stinking attitude. No signs of reassurance or willingness to help and no sense of urgency whatsoever. Complete waste of tax.,1
I've reduced my rating because when a consultant repeatedly tells you to get a second opinion it's makes you wonder if they actually want to treat you.  So upset.,2
The only good thing in here is the parking facility. ALWAYS IS A F****** PROBLEM. YOU MAKE A APPOINTMENT FOR A CERTAIN HR AND YET YOU STILL HAVE TO WAIT 2 MORE F****** HRS. ALWAYS THE SAME ALWAYS THE F**** SAME. NOBODY COMES TO URGENT F**** CARE IF IT DOESNT NEED. PUT SOME MORE DOCTORS IN.,1

After waiting 3 hours for my baby to be seen I was told he had a viral cough and he would recover by himself 2 weeks on he still had this cough so I took him to my GP to be told he has a really bad chest infection and an ear infection and it could have been avoided if they had given him an antibiotic that day I took him .. very bad service..,1

VERY GOOD AND WELL ORGANIZED,5

Very kind staff!!!!!!,1
"Maternity, labor, postnatal and pediatric teams were all fantastic. I had a complicated delivery here that involved an emergency c-section, and five days after being discharged my baby was readmitted. While it was an incredibly stressful time, we knew we were in good hands with plenty of support and reassurance from the wonderful staff at every level. While there were maybe a few we had a harder time with, many of them were thoroughly lovely human beings who really impressed us with their proficiency and kindness. Thank you all for taking such good care of us!",5
"I can not believe all the pathetic stories and bad reviews i see here !!!! I myself have been a patient a couple of times and yes there is waiting and yes it is uncomfortable if one is unwell but considering the amount of demanding and often rude patients this hospital have to manage and none of us has to pay a penny for it !! We should calm down and think twice before we trash the hospital staff!!! They are doing the best they can considering the little support from the government !! I am not a very patient person myself but i recommend to all those rude people here ... If you don't like it .... pay 300 quit for a private doctor ......
I always have to wait a little but the nurses and doctors i have seen after all are all wonderful",5
"I just got back home from my visit to the A&E/urgent treatment clinic after injuring my foot. It took me 2 days before I decided to go, mainly because I was dreading the experience. If you're in the same boat with an injury like mine - call 111 to see if you need to go and if you do they'll call ahead so things are more organised when you arrive - I wish I had done this straight away rather than waiting. All in all everyone involved in my care was brilliant, and I was in and out within around 3 hours after 2 consultations and an x-ray confirmed my foot is broken 😩 but I'm very grateful that my experience was not anywhere near as horrific as some of the other reviews lead me to believe.",5
"The staff in Ward C3 went above and beyond in duty and care for my mother in law who was in this ward recently.  The attitude of the team was amazing and positive,  they all pulled together to ensure all the patients were comfortable and cared for, even in particularly trying circumstances.

I would like to especially thank Mary and  Fatima both were exceptionally  caring and conscientious.   I can't thank the staff enough,  for the  incredible job they do.  Both team shifts of Ward C3 should be the torch bearers of good practise and professionalism for the NHS",5
"Worst hospital I've been to ruined the birth of my baby from start to finish was shocked at a lot of the staff and there attitudes, not all staff as there was some really nice midwifes and drs but 80 percent of the staff don't want to be there and make it clear, over hearing them talking about they can't wait to go back to working social as the hospital work to much responsibility for the pay. Makes you feel safe plus most of them  don't know what they are doing. Would leave less then 1 star if I could! Do not have your baby here",1
"The North Manchester General Hospital's physiotherapy department delivers attentive care, offering comprehensive treatment plans tailored to individual needs. Skilled professionals provide effective therapy, demonstrating a commitment to patient recovery. However, occasional wait times may vary, impacting promptness of service delivery. Overall, a commendable service with room for minor improvement.",4
"I had to stay in hospital for a week (few days before giving birth and a few days after). All the staff were so friendly and understanding. At one point i cried when i couldnt get my baby to settle and a midwife came in and helped me so much. I dont know what i would have done that night without her. The whole time i was here not 1 staff member was rude or moody with anyone. Hearing the midwives laughing with patients and other midwives was so enjoyable to hear.
Huge thank you to all the staff who helped me through my whole stay here. Keep going youre all amazing 💖",5
"NMGH is my local hospital and has been since I was born. However, I'll speak about my most recent experience.

I went to hospital on Friday throwing up blood.
A&E got me in quite quickly as I had a heart rate of 170bpm.
A&E was hit and miss. Initially they rushed me into resus and stabilised me. Then I was released to a normal bay where the doctor tried to fob me off and didn't believe I'd been throwing up blood.. until I threw up fresh blood (bright red) and she tried to say it was old blood and it's ""fine"". I went for a CT scan where the porter had to shout at the staff as I'd been left for ages on a bed and hadn't been seen, even though I was seriously unwell. I passed out, as I had internal bleeding, and the staff on resus became quite annoyed that I had to go back so I could be stabilised again.
The doctor tried to say I was constipated (it was actually backed up digested blood).

I was moved to ward H3 where I couldn't fault the staff at all. They were absolutely amazing!
I was spoken to by a registrar overnight who explained everything to me and organised a blood transfusion. I was due to go for a camera into my stomach on Monday and would be having blood until then. Early Saturday morning I had a turn and I started passing out whilst lay down, and the blood transfusion was rushed through as my BP had dropped dramatically, as well as my haemoglobin. The consultants and registrars stabilised me and kept reassuring me.
I had the camera done a few hours later, once my first blood transfusion had been done, and the consultants and theatre staff were absolutely amazing and made me feel safe.
The only problem with ward H3 is that the nurses forgot to start me on IV meds after returning from theatre (fluids and omeprazole) and it was only picked up at handover where the nurse went mad and put a complaint in.
The rest of the care from H3 was amazing and I really loved the staff.

On Monday night I was moved to ward J6 as I no longer needed constant supervision as I was awake, walking around and eating etc.
I never want to go back to this ward.. which is weird as it's a sister ward to H3, but it's not a very nice ward.
I was kept awake all night with staff trying to force me to have meds I didn't need/want (paracetamol), forgetting things so repeatedly coming back etc. Then I finally managed to get back to sleep early morning and 3 members of staff loudly burst into the room, flicked the light on, said ""sorry"" with an attitude, demanded I get out of bed to change it (I'd been awake seconds, and it had only been done 7 or so hours ago), forced me to take pain meds I didn't want and weren't very pleasant.
The morning doctor came and saw me, didn't have a clue and clearly hadn't read my notes. He didn't even know why I had internal bleeding (stomach ulcer caused by meds that my GP had prescribed with nothing prescribed to coat my stomach whilst taking them), or that I'd even started my IV meds that I'd been on for the last 2.5 days. I tried to make him aware of some symptoms I was concerned about and he brushed me off and told me I was ""fine"" before walking out.
All of the staff, bar one who took my bloods (she's amazing), had an attitude, and I ended up just sat there crying as I wanted to go home due to their care. Eventually I ended up asking to self discharge, to which the nurse lied about what I'd said regarding the reason for me wanting to DAMA.
I thought maybe I was being difficult, but my bed was right near the main reception desk for the ward so I could hear conversations, and multiple patients had complained regarding staff attitudes, being left with no care, poo and blood being all over multiple bathrooms and not being cleaned for hours etc. Some patients had walked out and some did a DAMA for similar reasons to me. I also heard staff slagging off patients who had left/complained, including regarding myself.
I spoke to an overworked doctor as the ward was severely understaffed (which I also heard from a phone conversation) who was happy to let me go and I left at 11pm Tuesday.",3
"Awful experience from start to finish. My dad was sadly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer which had spread, he was then (after 3 ward moves) taken to the head and neck ward where he sadly passed away 8 days later. My dad needed specialist oncology care from nurses who were trained in end of life. The nurses on the head and neck ward didn’t really have a clue and were rude to family members who were visiting.",1
"Absolutely shocking and awful experience in A&E department. Husband was taken to a room that still had blood and other bio hazards from the last patient in there, when I asked why wasn’t it clean I had members of staff tutting their teeth at me and rolling their eyes. Another pxt complained about her room not being clean for her mother as again there were still bio hazards from previous pxts she got the same response when asking why it wasn’t clean.
Staff were rude and could not be arsed, had a face on every time I had asked anything. Took 3 hours and me nagging just to get some paracetamol for my husband. Not once did they come and check on time to make sure he’s okay or even alive.
Asking for a ward manager or a doctor to speak several times was like getting blood from a stone. I was getting passed pillar to post telling me there’s no doctors here. How can an A&E department not have any doctors?
Doctors didn’t want to engage or explain
anything that was going on with my husband.  Poor communication between staff resulting in them trying to take blood from my husband that didn’t need to be taken.
I have been warned many times this is an awful hospital but tonight I experienced it for myself.
Plenty more to go on and say but honestly one of the worst experiences we’ve had, extremely unprofessional as someone who works in health care I was truly appalled.",1
"I just want to say twice now we have gone to NMG. The first time via ambulance to A&E on the 12th Jan, with my partner Tom, the staff were lovely and friendly all of them smiling, yes there was a wait, a big wait, but the staff were lovely and kind to us, kept us informed and listened to us. From A&E and the Xray department to the front reception and even security lads. The second time was yesterday, 19th Jan,  on the follow up from this A&E visit. He went via ACU, and they were so lovely. They made us a hot drinks and looked after us all day long. The reception staff, the phlebotomomist lady, the nurses on the ward, esp one nurse, aww she was so amazing, I can't tell you how much they went out of their way to make sure Tom was OK, and me, the Dr on ACU, even wheeled Tom down to Xray! The cardiologist came when he said he would too. Drs all very efficient, and kind, listened & answered our questions, I couldn't believe it.  They ALL, on both visits answered any questions, if they didn't know the answer they found it, and kept us informed at every step, every one of them, nothing at all was too much trouble, until he was admitted finally to the Cardiology ward, late last night. I'll never be able to thank them enough for their kindness, plus for the first time in 5 months, I didn't feel like we were completely & utterly alone, trying to dealing with his heart failure...Thank you NMG, all of you.  Tom and I don't know where this is going, we are so frightened, but thank you for grabbing both of our hands, and holding us up, to face it.... sincerely ......Lorraine (and Tom)  x",5
"Thank you to the Oral and Maxillofacial team when I had a procedure here on 15/11/23.  All staff were very friendly, polite and efficient.   Thank you the the Dr, I think she was called Dr Connie Choi who performed the surgery to extract an impacted tooth and the three dental nurses who assisted her.   She was very professional.   I am grateful also to Mr Aleid who I saw in outpatients prior to the procedure and who I found to be  extremely courteous, going the extra mile to organise timely investigations and being very clear about the benefits and risks associated with the surgery.",5
"Worst hospital,I waited my appointment with triage ward from 4pm-12 am then the obstetrition will not meet me,and send the midwife to tell me nothing dangerous,
I was worry about my first pregnancy,specially I have an open heart surgery and stroks,
The first receptionist was kind and she provid a bed for waiting this long time,then the next receptionist told me wait outside on the chair,untill I shout and told them I cant wait on the chair in my situation untill tomorrow( we don't know when the doctor will come,there was no doctor) the midwife came and I explain that this receptionist asked me to wait outside ,she told me you can wait here in the bed.
I will avoid this hospital in the future
I hope they improve their treatment ,and hope will be better and kind ,not evil like the second receptionist,it was on Wed 29 Nov .",1
"Trying to get through to physiotherapy requires, under no exaggeration, 200 attempts. It'd be a record if I were willing to sit and do the same again the opposite direction to make it Guinness approved, and ain't nobody got time for that. Line is always engaged ending 2423 and 2425 and on the odd occasion it does go through, staff either pick up and put the phone down or it's diverted after 6 rings to another number that doesn't exist.",1
"Where do I start? 20 hours in a&e sat in a wheelchair in pain - no beds - get to a ward there is no bed lights - no staff checking oxygen wall pumps until someone needed it and hers was broke.  Wrong food and lack of food every day - also overcooked tasteless food.
Daily ward checks not done. It's very shocking.",2
"They deleted the previous comment of mine. They treated me with the utmost racism, and my daughter was with me. Instead of asking the mother, they ignored me in a terrible way, they spoke to my daughter, accused me, and asked me strange questions. They made me feel like I was a dangerous criminal and they caught me. Their racism requires a volume to be written about, and there is no room for that now.",1
"They messed up my daughters birth 34 years ago, it was embarrassing to see how little they knew and were chancers. This time my brother went in by ambulance due to respiratory and heart problems confirmed by the ambulance team. After being given mixed tales all day he had to make his own way home in a taxi no valid reason and made no contact to his relatives who had phoned through the day waiting for a result.",1
"Excellent 2 visits to the audiology dept in September  The audiologist Hadjra? was lovely, kind, patient and an excellent communicator. Everything was clearly explained  and I found her very professional.  A credit to the audiology team.",5
"By far one of the worst hospitals around. I’ve had ongoing treatment cancelled the day before 3 times in a row though my mft. No staff to speak to, no way to get in touch and no explanation. They don’t care if you’re in pain, it’s awful.",1
"Absolutely shocking. The parking situation is simply terrible, no parking at all by 10am.The nurses are rude and dismissive. The NHS need to be overhauled ASAP. I'm not blaming the cuts because the staff are terrible too.",2
I had to wait 5 hours to get my nail checked. That took 10 minutes. Someone waited 6/7 hours just to get some medicine. Another family left because they were sick to death of the wait. The reasoning? The doctors always drinking coffee or on their phones.,1
"Appointment 10:10am for children's outpatients
fracture clinic.... no parking, rush rush rush to make appointment, then one by one they all get treated and 2 hours later we are still sat in the deserted waiting area...

The only saving grace to this establishment is the staff, friendly and courteous but clearly overworked!

how is this place still open for business? What a shambles!",1
"I was admitted to the Resus. Unit on Monday afternoon after a health scare. Later that night I was transferred to the assessment unit. I would like to thank all the staff I came into contact with on both units.  They were all so helpful, friendly,  and very professional at all times. A very reassuring experience. Thank you.",5
"I got consulted by Dr Shahrukh Ashraf Khan on 29 Sep (Friday) around noon who was nice and very kind-hearted❤️💯👍.  He worked in Ward G2 Ambulatory Care Unit under North Manchester General Hospital (Delaunays Rd. Crumpsall, M8 5RB)

He explained clearly my results of blood check, body scan and X-ray, just completed by his professional nurse team, are all normal.  He professionally look into my concerns as a patient undergoing chemotherapy for 7 cycles already and relaxed me a lot which is amazingly to me.  I can't control myself to express my deep gratitude to Dr Shahrukh Ashraf Khan and his nurse team.❤️❤️

My case was advised and referred effectively by the GP Dr.Kayani that day ~10:00am as my recent blood check spotted in abnormal trends, Dr. R Ogundiran followed my case previously under Victoria Mill Medical Practice.",5
"I experience the worst form of racism, I was actually told to wait that the white kids are more privilege and priority than my child. We had to wait till after everyone before we got attended to… After 6 hours from 12 am to 6 am.. very bad and lazy set of workers…",1
"Relative left in agony for 7 hours in A&E with no analgesia. They had a potentially unsafe swallow but were being pressurised to take antibiotics orally, despite awaiting rv by anaesthetist. These are just a couple of examples of the shockingly poor care received. Team leader defensive, devoid of empathy, utterly unhelpful and rude.",1
"Absolute joke. Sat in A&E for 1 hour after being told by the receptionist to take a seat, once questioned about my bloods not being taken i got told that u didnt tell us you are here. The attitude of staff is an absolute diagrace as they couldn't care less if you are dying in pain as they are too busy having a full on conversation! Rude staff!!",1
"My Mum was rushed in and sadly passed away 5 days later. 1st Dr met me with the shock ""we don't expect her to live more than an hour"". She fought for 5 days but when I turned up on the 5th day 2nd Dr said ""You've  missed her as she died 5 minutes earlier"". No one has any compassion. Patients are treated like objects and loved ones not much better. Most staff on their mobiles all the time. Maybe they should Google what being a caring human being means.",1
"1. Maternity.. poor. Regular appointments and scans aren’t bad, I can’t complain about them, always lovely staff chatty friendly informative. ALTHOUGH. I am still waiting for a doctor to sign off my prescription I was given about 4 months ago by a midwife there!
the maternity wards, again lovely staff it’s not their fault. It’s just poor, It was all one step forward and two steps back every step of the way. Being asked to come in to get induced, didn’t get induced until ethe next day, 24 hours after this the pessary was removed.. then waiting 2 days for a bed on labour (so I’m taking up a bed here that someone else can have) get to labour FINALLY to be told I wasn’t having my waters broke because they were busy and I might be sent back to antenatal.. energy section. Then 2 days on post natal watching everyone go home with their babies and I’m waiting to get discharged.. The staff are doing their best, it’s the resources. At the time two more hospitals were sending their maternity patients over to north, therefore putting extra work and strain onto them and their own patients. But their patients should come first.

The best part of my experience was the midwife on labour Cindy who I had for the first 10 or so hours and then Kirsty who carried the rest of the delivery out up
Being took to theatre and all of the theatre staff when I was took for an emergency section. They were amazing couldnt thank them enough for getting my baby girl here and keeping me calm, all of them just amazing. Also student midwife Lauren from Bolton university I think her name was? Amazing friendly woman who came to check on us afterwards, it’s the little things that make the difference! She really was lovely!

There was some patients that on post natal were getting the midwife’s to do everything for them doing nothing for themselves, I asked a midwife to help me wind the baby as she wasn’t settling and was full of wind even though I’d tried and the midwife looked at me like I had three heads asking the world of her!

It needs to be improved, apart from some lovely staff the rest is poor.
PARKING… AWFUL. Turn up atleast an hour before your appointment because you’ll be looking for a space for a while! I always ended up parking streets away and walking over!",3
"Visited the hospital today, the parking near the outpatients is horrendous!!  I was late for my 10 am appointment at physiotherapy by 15 minutes due to waiting for car space, however, I was seen at 11am.  I am so glad I waited as the lady who saw me was absolutely brilliant, very informative and very professional, I forget her name but thank you very much!",5
"Above and beyond kindness tonight by a lovely lady called Emma at the A&E department. Warm and kind and service with a smile. I arrived in an ambulance feeling worried and anxious and I left feeling so grateful. Thank you to all the team at North Manchester, especially you Emma xx

Amanda",5
"If you're a final year medical student considering this hospital for foundation I would avoid it at all costs. My grandmother died and the funeral was on the same date as my ALS. I spoke to the foundation team about delaying my ARCP so that I would be able to attend the funeral and they basically told me that it was not their problem. Considering the head of the foundation program was a doctor I feel like the lack of empathy can only be deliberate. Looking back having worked in a variety of other hospitals I can only describe their response as sociopathic. This doesn't even consider their response to clinical concerns brought to them by foundation doctors, which was to say, you'll go through and act differently when you're a consultant.",1
"Came in to A&E with a swollen tongue and gums, had difficulty breathing and swallowing but they didn’t assess me, they didn’t take any physical observations, instead they turned me away and said “ if you are in pain you need to go a pharmacy, there’s nothing they can do for me here” .",1
Called for hours and am unable and to cancel an appointment made without my knowledge after I moved out of the area. Incredibly rude staff when first called before being put through to appointments. Terrible overall and wasting nhs appointments themselves.,1
"The staff in your hospital are racist, they have no mercy, they are rude, I was treated with the utmost racism. I don't know who to complained to, but I will not be silent, and that's why I wrote this e-mail. I want them to know that I am not an animal to be treated in this way.",1
"we came yesterday 11/12/2022 3 hours of waiting then they call us another 3 hours in the room and the pediatrician with the mobile chatting talks so he can see my son no case, he had a problem with vomiting and sore throat and fever, one hour drinking water no vomiting they send us home without medication, the child got worse and we returned with an ambulance the next day the doctors with cell phones playing games waiting 5 hours for them to understand us no matter what, I take a taxi and go home,",1
"A brilliant hospital, great caring staff, me, and my family have had to use the hospital and ambulance services a number of times over the years.

Nothing but respect for all the staff that do a great job.

Thank you, and keep up the good work 🙂",5
Poor care on ward F3. Wasn't allowed water despite having a twisted bowel and dehydrated. No apathy from the nurses. Non updates until I chase up.,2
"It's my 3rd time when I am giving the blood sample for the same blood tests.
Repetitively receiving the messages of giving the blood sample again and again as it has lost or not arrived at blood room or something else. Now exhausted.  What are they doing with the blood samples??",1
Always felt welcome at this hospital lovely workers also x,5
Avoid this hospital. I guess that's how the jail looks like. Horrendous hygiene and patients treatment. Please avoid for your own safety.,1
I was seen by the amazing staff and doctors they were so professional not to mention smiling all the time they were really buzy but they all were amazing. Thankyou guys god bless much love Tanya ❤️,5
"I kept going here multiple times to see what was wrong with my hearing since I couldn't understand what people say, Just for the audiologists to all blame it on my autism. those were many appointments before finally being told it was something else.",3
The best neonatal care ever! All the staff is absolutely amazing and very friendly and helpful and they become part of your family because they care even your baby is discharged. They have heart on the right place. Labour is also perfect they know what they doing even you can think something else but after some time u undrestand maybe they don't want to stress you out. But with children unit I was very disappointed. Staff were nice but rules over there are like in the prison. After really hard night without sleeping you can't get bed because it is possible only in the evening not through the day.,4
"I was many times in this hospital.  Waiting time always about 6-8 hours.  Day before I gave a birth I went with my older one... 9 hours in Waiting room.  I was fuming,  swearing.. I said I will never say nice word about this hospital... two weeks later I came back with my newborn baby. Came in straight away... my son was in critical condition... so many nurses and doctors around my boy. They fight for my son life really hard and save my baby .. now I know when I am in waiting room for a long time , probably someone behind the door may fight for life ... so if you need to wait, probably someone need help right now . They know what they are doing.
Thank you for all doctors and nurses from baby Kacper 💙",5
"When you make your way for a surgery appointment, you waiting and then they tell you that the doctor is in his holidays. Bad this place. Should of been closed down years ago, not the 1st time, people were sat there clearly struggled with mobility and to get told. “Might as well go home”
Poor",1
"A friend of mine has been dealing with an issue with her tailbone. She has had 3 different surgeries… they told her that she would be able to sit normally in 2 weeks after surgery… it has been a month and a half and is now dealing with the hospital not taking her issues seriously! She said they were unclean, unorganized and some how mess scheduling up ALL the time! She has shown up 3 times out of 5 times a week with them telling her they cannot see her because they do not have her down even though they have photographic proof of scheduling! If I could rate this place lower than a 1 star I would. Not happy do not waste your time at this hospital",1
"Very impressed with the NHS staff and costa cafe Staff especially especia Lisa.  Great service, and I was thoroughly checked over. Treated with respect and dignity.  Kept informed of my waiting time and progress of tests being carried out.  Thank you",5
"Can't fault the A&E department team on duty when I attended.
The Fracture outpatients clinic was a different story. Had 3 visits.  Shortest was 90 mins longest over 3 hours (they will tell you in the letter your appointment is 15 minutes..plan your time because they can't. Eat before you go and take water..clear the rest of your day.... )Absolute shambles ,staff can't communicate. Long delays but staff seem to have plenty of time to chat...receptionist was bolshy and quite abrupt when I asked her why so many people where coming in after me and leaving before me.. turns out they literally just forgot about me... treated me like I was the problem just for asking why I in particular was there so long, just to tell me I was discharged, didn't even need to give me an xray or a splint..whilst I watched countless people come and go after me...
The h.c.a didn't Even seem to wonder or care why I was still there after 3hours .. must be a regular occurance..I'm more angry that they couldn't take responsibility for it and just say we overlooked you... came out with a load of rhetoric like, ' every brake is different ' 'it's a busy clinic'... but it was obviously down to poor organisation and the inability to prioritise...
Very unprofessional team.",3
"We are from Liverpool but was at a football tournament in Manchester when my son fell and broke two bones in his wrist we came here as was the closest the staff were beyond amazing we didn’t even wait to be called he was straight in and given strong painkillers they had to manipulate to get his bones straight again my son was calm chatty and cheeky the whole time we were here everyone from nurses doctors to porters made him calm and relaxed and Zach made each one of the people involved in his care smile I can not fault his treatment yesterday at this hospital and Iam so very thankful for each and everyone of you who helped my son
Thank
You",5
"My 20 year old son injured his ankle at work and could not weight bear, was swollen and worried he had broken it.

Arrived at A&E 3:30pm checked in quickly by lovely polite member of staff, moved on quickly to the Emergency Assessment Unit, assessed and sent for X-rays.

Outcome possible small fracture resulting in boot to support.  All this was done in two hours we left at 5:30pm

I cannot express enough how fantastic the staff were especially in EAU who looked after my son  (forgot to ask her name ) but honestly my son and I said how wonderful you were and made our experience a wonderful one, thank you so much.",5
Absolute joke Worst A& E  / RAM services in the country . waiting with my partner 8 hours she is pregnant (PRIORITY) and was bleeding with sharp stomach pain and no one seems care .  Even if you die  right in front of them no one will notice .Unprofessional staff and shortage of doctors !! I have asked for bed after waiting 5h as she was not feeling well and the nurse said we only have one bed which is in use!! Don’t bother going unless you literally about to die and I’m not sure if they are going to accept to see you straight away.!? After all this wait we were sent home for Monday appointments as no scanner was available there .  Feels like I’m living in the Stone Age!!!! Shame on you all. !,1
Don't answer the phones to let families know how there loved ones are doing leaving people with no diagnosis for a week not contact families to let them outcome of operations on request before it's carried out. How are they getting away with that.,1
This hospital is amazing. I've been in and out several times over the past 3 months and the staff are always friendly and positive if you treat them with the respect they deserve. They're so overworked yet still do there upmost. A big shout to all the staff on wards F2 and C6. A&E department and the day service ward. You deserve medals for your work and I hope you get the raise you deserve. Thank you for taking cars of me during my stays and surgery afterwards.,5
"I was in pain 4 days and had to go to E&R(Crumpsall), Within almost 5 hours I had an Emergency Operation. As to my previous experience in other hospital The whole thing was absolutely fantastic. Everyone I came a cross were very polite and considerate and helpful and supportive all the way through my recovering period every step was explained and all nurses were by my side at all times making sure that I was comfortable during the whole process, I really want to say THANK Q to every single person who came a cross me and supported me. NHS Staff very very kind and I know they don't get paid for that, The only reward for them is reports of individual with their personal experiences to express how well they were treated. I am very grateful to the whole team on Thursday 20/04/2023 that they took care of me and supported me WELL DONE I will never forget what you done for me.
Ps The whole place was noticeably very tidy and very clean
Thank you.
Mr K N Tehrani(Nick)",5
"Recently, I had a problem with my earring aid. Which I'm glad to say was sorted both quickly and to my satisfaction can not fault the staff in out patient B",5
"Just like to thank everybody on the A&E ward for looking after me last night. Very professional and caring, sending my love 💓 and best wishes to all of you. Hope you all get a massive pay rise 🙏",5
"The receptionist at the adult A&E called (Abby) she told me your appointment will take up to an hour and I was waiting for more than an hour then she said I told you it'll take minimum an hour. She lied to my face and when I asked to see her supervisor they told me I can't see any supervisors.
I don't have any problems with waiting but I have problems with lying.",1
"My husband has been a patient under the Cardiology department for many years as he had a mitral valve repair in May 1999. He has a yearly appointment for check ups. Last year he had his appointment as normal, and was waiting for a echo cardiogram, which to this date he has never had despite numerous phone calls to the cardiologists receptionist who kept on saying there was a long waiting list. Why does it take over 12 months when every year it is within a month? He  has not received an appointment for this year he has just dropped off the hospital system altogether. The telephone number we have for Dr Jenkins Secretary is saying not recognised. Very very disappointed with North Manchester hospital.",1
Always very helpful each and every time I’ve been here a lovely hospital j Donoghue x,5
Just been discharged from ward C5. Cannot praise the staff enough. They are run off their feet but were always approachable and obliging to  me when I needed help. Would like to say too whoever manages this team. what a great group you have..,5
"Very, very long waiting times, waited 7 hours for my 4 year old daughter to be seen for a water infection. At 4am we were told they were just waiting for the antibiotics to be sent...to be then told 40 mins later we had to come back to the pharmacy at 7am. We came back later on to collect the prescription and had to drive around for 35 minutes looking for a parking space. Ended up dumping my car in a random spot in order to make it to the pharmacy. Probably won't come here again, it was just chaos from start to finish.",1
"We went to children's A and E on Sunday and it was unbelievably busy just absolute chaos screaming poorly babies children running round and rude parents trying to jump the queue.
Even with all of it the staff were brilliant the lady that saw us she referred to herself as a consultant nurse I think she was in black with short dark hair.
She was lovely obviously made for the job no messing just brilliant care and attention, we got a prescription for pharmacy which had just closed when we got there so I went back to explain to the receptionist staff an she heard came straight out an dealt with it no problems.Thank you very much!",5
"Tried ringing the Booking Office 5 times - each time at least 1/2 hr to 45 minute wait and each time when next to be answered it cut the call off saying their was a fault. Dreadful service, someone needs to sort this out!!!
This would not be allowed in the Private Sector as someone would be accountable, sadly not the case in the NHS .... to busy striking for more money rather than doing their job correctly.",1
"Don't bother going unless you're literally about to die.
My elderly Mum had a bad fall and split her head open. Told it would be 6-8 hours to be seen (this was around midnight Thursday night) and we'd be best just going home and ringing an ambulance if she started vomiting/had a seizure, etc.
Shocking standard of care. The staff on the desk could not care less if they tried.
The security team were very helpful though. She's okay but if she hadn't been, we would 100% have sued.",1
"Excellent went for my first physiotherapy appointment today, the only fault was it was a bit difficult to park as there wasn’t many spaces but other than that no complaints",5
I came to the hospital with my sister on 10-12-22 as she had fever of 40°. We wait for 5 hours and they checked her temperature 3 times it kept going up the third time. We were asked to lay her down in cubical box room as she needed cool down and were advised she needs to wear less clothes to cool down the temperature. After the third time checking they us she needs wear as her temperature is going up again and we followed their advise again. However another nurse came in 10 mins to us saying we have have to leave the room  and wait outside as they have more patient while all the nurse before her told us  to stay in the room. We left the hospital straight as they didn’t care about 6 year old well being but kept showing on tv in the waiting room we care about the patient wellbeing which is totally opposite to how they behave. We are back again on 11-12-22 as her temperature is still 40° since last night. Again we are the second in waiting queue and they mentioned on the white board it is 2-3 waiting time and it has been more then 3 hours and they haven’t seen anyone in those hours and place is packed again and we are waiting again with her on high temperature of 40 again as usual waiting until she gets more worse and they will still have us waiting as usual. Things will still the same in future as they are so disorganised as ever.,1
"Absolutely appalling service in the RAM - which stands for Rapid Assessment but its anything but rapid here!!! 5 hours plus wait for them to see 10 patients, doctors dipping their own urines and taking their own bloods and walking them to the lab themselves. During the longest wait ever one doctor goes home and leaves the slowest doctor on shift…we arrived here at 10.30pm and still waiting at 3.30am…joke service.",1
"We are currently at North Manchester Hospital and must say the care and respect they have show is amazing, we came into north manchester after a few miss diagnosis with Fairfield, we are currently on the children's ward and all nurses and receptionist have been lovely! Thank you for looking after our little boy! I must also say if you treat the nurses and doctors with respect they deserve you will also receive the same!

Update- discharged on Sunday 8.1.23 amazing staff, special mention to Sadiyya such a lovely nurse with nothing too much trouble! Our lad is now recovering very well thanks to the quick intervention from North Manchester!",5
"I am writing for my mother On Wednesday 30th November she was suppose to have an operation to remove her lymph nodes, because she has BREAST CANCER. And she got sent home due to lack of staff and their inability to know which patients are priority.

She was admitted at 11:30am and left at 5:30pm. She had no drink, nothing to eat all day. It was the Day surgery Endoscopy department. They sent home a CANCER patient home.
No nurse would stay and assist Dr Abass as they had finish their shifts. Do not blame Dr Abass because she tried hard finding available nurses. When I tried to complain in person, there was no one on the ward. Absolutely disgusting.

North Manchester General Hospital.",1
"The fear i had initially after reading the through other people's reviews disappeared after we were warmly attended to by a God sent midwife in the ante natal department on Saturday (Jacqueline).This woman was so good and knows what she's doing.I was  forced to thank her after the delivery for her efforts,respects and friendliness. She was so amazing. I mean this is a good example of good staffing at work places.I really recommend her for a top position at that hospital. She will really make that difference they need....",4
"Absolute joke. Been ringing for 10 minutes straight trying to contact the orthodontist department and they keep picking it up, you can hear background conversation and then it clicks, hold music and then rings again. Yet they discharge you if you miss an appointment and don't reschedule. How am I supposed to reschedule?",1
"Paramedics missed a serious back problem transported me without neck brace staff and consultant would not listen to me. I had to have surgery elsewhere but I didn’t want it knowing my back was probably broken. This hospital didn’t do backs I was informed. The day after they did the surgery I had a numb leg, a spine broken in several places and I got a young doctor to feel my spine. Within 20 mins I had my own swat team if consultants. Short story I had been been mishandled nobody listened to me. I spent 4,weeks in this dump waiting to go to another hospital. They put the wrong back brace on, they messed up my transfusion and my medications. I got told by a nurse ‘ I was just a bed’ and now a patient of Salford Royal and they refused to do much to help me. Am now 8 years on struggling to walk. I was physically and verbally abused on the ward by night staff. Salford royal made one major mistake and my life was ruined. So if you want bad food, a few bad nurses, and no help this is a good place! 😡",1
"Was in day services 3 days ago and all I can say is what a truly amazing bunch of nurses made me feel comfortable before and after the operation truly great full for all there support and help,amazing people",5
"Big up to staff at day care 2 and surgeons  ,registrars  ,volunteers  ,and to c ward 6 nurses volunteers etc .they were excellent professional kind caring before ,during and after my operation yesterday ,many thanks and appreciation",4
"I was very tired and went to the hospital by ambulance. I waited 6 hours waiting, and despite all this, the doctor told me, and his style was arrogant and indifferent. He said to buy treatment from the pharmacy. In the beginning, he told me that you had an infection, and when I asked him about an antibiotic to help me, he said no, everyone is now sick, you must buy treatment  From the pharmacy, and everyone knows that pharmacies do not dispense the antibiotic without a prescription. Then he prescribed me a cough remedy from the hospital pharmacy, and although I needed it very much because I was tired, he told me to come tomorrow and receive the treatment... So why all this fatigue from the beginning? Why the 6 hours of fatigue and waiting? Some of the doctors’ methods tarnished his reputation  The hospital, I hope, will change for the better",1
"Came in to A&E passing a suspected kidney stone, they were great have me a jab which took away all the pain and I had blood tests and left! My complaint now is when I’ve rang up for test results! North Manchester Hospital state that they can’t give to me and my doctors can only request them so I ring my doctors who state that they can’t get them as they are a different entity so I ring the hospital back and doctors back and forth. The last call to the hospital I say I’m having to record the conversation in case anything happens to me as I can’t get any results and the lady on A&E says I’m being rude with her which I’m not at all and puts the phone down! Wow pretty unbelievable really I just can’t get my results so your internal system for patients is not acceptable so fingers crossed there isn’t anything bad in my blood tests as I just don’t know! Feel very let down by your incompetence.",1
"I spent 19 hours waiting on a chair in
A&E for a bed on a ward. Was offered no refreshments and had to keep begging for pain killers. I spent a further 6 days in hospital and was sent home still in excruciating pain with just painkillers. Hospital said they couldn’t find out what was causing they pain and couldn’t explain why my Liver blood count was in the 1000’s when should be below 20. I have now had to pay to go private to find out I have stones blocking by bile duct to the liver and need an urgent operation. How is it acceptable to be sent home from this hospital and not to be diagnosed and just told to take some painkillers. Terrible hospital, avoid and go somewhere else to get a proper diagnosis.",1
"DON'T GO THERE. Yesterday waited for 12 hours, just to be sent home with an appointment for the next day 8am. Today, here for 6 hours, still haven't been seen. Up for a surgery so they won't let me eat or drink, yesterday all day without any food or water, today the same. And all of it for nothing.  It seems like it's better to die than come here.",1
"I am not complaining for myself i was taking someone who was disabled no use of legs in a wheelchair and living with a brain injury ...with a shoulder injury.  4 hours wait before being seen then another 2 hours waiting for results before I had to say something i said 6 hours when your able  bodied but 6 hours for
a disabled person whose not been to the toilet its not on.  No hot drinks mo machine drinks or snacks the staff are over worked and it shows The A&E is an awful experience the staff are doing there best in a badly organised badly designed department",2
"The staff were great and did their best, but there's only so much 1 doctor on duty on the children's A&E can do
Booked in about 7:42 pm with and estimated time to see a doctor of 2 hours. About 2 hours later the estimated wait time was increased to 5 hours. After waiting 6hours15 minutes, all patients save 1 that arrived before us had been seen, so not long to go. Alas the wait time was again increased further to 7-8 hours.
Eventually asked to a cubicle to be seen next. Waited a further 1/2 hour, then told someone else was to be seen. We had to leave at 4:15am without being seen by doctor, the child was totally worn out and tired and hungry after waiting 8 and a half hours
We prayed for the best and returned home",1
Hospital building work is causing the local residents a huge illegal parking issue. The fact that hospital staff are literally dumping their cars on our streets is absolutely appalling!! We cannot get out of our own homes or drives as the hospital staff carelessly parking cars on “RESIDENT PERMIT HOLDERS” streets all day. Looks as if people literally CANNOT read the signs whatsoever! Hospital administration must look into this matter immediately. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING,1
I am only 11 years old and on Wednesday the 19th of October I found out my shoulder was dislocated and fractured.  Fairfield hospital told me to wait 24h to 48h for a call from North Manchester hospital 3 days passed and I didn't get a call so I thought it was time for me to call I called and they said   on Monday 24th of October I will have a appointment. I called North Manchester hospital and they said I have to wait till the 10th of November I was already in alot of pain they said they will check with there colleagues and left me on hold 2 minutes later they hang up.,1
I went in A&E they were great. Everyone. I waited 30hrs for a bed but was well assisted in that time. I had an emergency operation and went on a ward. They too were fantastic and couldn’t do enough for me.,5
Just spent 5 to 6 hours at North Manchester General Hospital what a utter sham sat ther from 5.45 till 10.30 absolutely disgraceful what is the issue there seem to be 1 doctor and a bunch of nurses and think 1 head nurse in dark blue uniform wow what a attitude all I could here was her saying 4.5 hours waiting time in a manner that should not be allowed  for god's sake we were all people who wanted treating not spoken to like a child  so someone tell me did they not just get extra pay oh yes and a lump sum as well why why have they received this why  oh and to top it all my sister went for ECG and the nurse was chatting to her and said all the doctors here did not have the COVID injection wow 😲 so why were we told to awnsers needed,1
"Unfortunately in the past I have had some really bad experiences as an inpatient, some of which has taken a lot to get over.
As a patient you go onto a ward as a captive audience, no other choice. You are often at your lowest point and feel out of your comfort zone, even vulnerable; when normally you are so strong! This is when the care you receive from the nursing staff is so critical. Last week I went to C4 after surgery and honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I cannot praise the staff enough. They were so caring, thorough, knowledgeable and efficient even with meds. Their efficiency is second to none, in the past a delay in meds led to sepsis for me, yet here there was never any delay in meds. People on this ward, including the ward Clark and theatre staff, are led by a good old fashioned moral compass; patient care and the patient experience...they have hearts of gold and go above and beyond for everyone.
I never normally post on anywhere but I wish I had read a review like this before visiting C4. So if you are unfortunately having to face surgery and you end up on this ward Julie and her team will welcome you and put you at ease. Please do not worry, this is a team that will look after you.

Thank you to the Theatre Team and C4 you are all doing an amazing job!! It makes it even more amazing that you have been doing all of this whilst managing with plan B's as a result of a major I.T. crisis! Your resilience and professionalism is unwavering.

Best wishes,
Aimee Mills.",5
My wife had a brilliant delivery experience on 21st November however the midwife we saw yesterday 19th December in the birthing centre for our son's BCG was a nasty piece of work. An aged overweight midwife who was more concerned about our mode of transport rather than sorting out our son's BCG and inquiring if we had a car seat for our son and our 2 year old daughter as well. Next time concentrate on the job at hand rather than meddling in other people's affairs. Focus on what you are paid to do like the delivery team and mind your own business!!,1
"Second time unfortunately in 3 months I have been!…first time really bad experience
Yesterday night amazing staff service from A&e gif bless you all thanks again..my dislocated arm is getting bette thanks 👏👏🙏🙏🙏",5
"The only thing I don't like about this hospital is, it's too diffused.
If this is your first time going there, you need extra direction to get round.
There are so many entrances, at least so I think.
They are however, just as efficient as a good hospital.",5
"I would like to thank the team in pre - op department E, especially Gail, for taking care of my husband, they were outstanding. The security guard, I didn't get his name, who explained to us best place to park was most helpful. No problems with parking, no waiting time, polite, and caring very efficient staff.",5
"On Sunday 6th August, we were asked by Saint Marys hospital if we can do them a favour and go to Crumpsall Hospital ad they had less beds in Saint Marys Labour ward, we got to Crumpsall Hospital at 6pm, by wife was admitted and asked to stay on a empty ward at 11pm the induction process started, straight after I was asked to leave, I insisted that I needed to stay as I could tell she was going to be in pain as well as that the ward was empty. the beeper holder came, I literally begged for them to let me stay but no one listened. I then left and slept outside in the carpark whilst my wife was in pain. At 2am my wife asked the midwife if she can please rub her back because of the pain, but the staff were more interested in doing hairstyles and talking about relationships. The next morning when I was allowed back in I asked to leave and go back to Saint Marys, the beeper holder Karen came and she was astonished to hear about the problems we faced and promised to investigate and call back, since then its been 6 days but still have not had a response. The staff at Saint Marys were amazing and I wished e never went Crumpsall.",1
Have been sat here for the past 12 hours waiting for an mri scan and a room I've just been told they don't know when I will get a room and when the Mri will be,1
been there for my surgery ward c6 brilliant staff,5
"Excellent service from Ged in UTC removing foreign body (small metal/ paint felt awful) from my eye efficiently. Lots of stories about the NHS, and not the same for everyone, but couldn’t fault the service at all.",5
"I went with a pretty bad pet bite, I was expecting a 6 hour A&E wait as I'd heard how busy it was. So was pleasently surprised to be  put to minor injuries who had me in and out in 2 hours. The doctor and nurse were apologetic about the wait, and all the staff were lovely. I seen them set a guy up on a stretcher so he could watch the football, and offer an other guy who was waiting for treatment a sandwich. They honestly couldn't do enough. There was a cleaner buzzing about the entire time too  which was really reassuring.",5
"I gave birth to my four children in this hospital, and the treatment was more than wonderful. Also, when my daughter got sick and they performed an excellent medical intervention for her, the doctors, nurses, and workers in the pediatric department were very good, and my husband underwent an operation in it. The experience was also good, and the last thing I had  I had an operation in the hospital, the doctor was one of the best doctors that I met, and the nurses in the department treated them wonderfully. It was in the C3 department.",5
Absolutely understaffed. Gone to A&E waited 7 hours with an ill baby because there was just one doctor. 🤯 madness,1
"Very poor service, absolutely rubbish, very long waiting times, there was only one doctor waiting to see almost 16-20 patients, i was waiting almost 8 hours before i was seen by a dr in severe agony, the staff at the reception were very rude when i approached them they began shouting and telling me that its not their fault Im having to wait this many hours, absolutely disgusting",1
"Well to say I gave birth here to my son I’m happy everything went smoothly for the birth but to say the staff weren’t exactly much help when I first went in, I asked for gas and air baring in mind I was having contractions therefore should be given what ever I choose unless a health issue is there witch there wasn’t I was refused and out into a room with other women forcing myself to hold my child in when the midwife checked and told me he wasn’t anywhere near arrival when I was and I continued to tell them this it was only until I screamed in agony that I couldn’t hold anymore did they believe me but all the way through my birth I didn’t get a choice in any matter, I was told I would be in a birthing ward so I’d have my own room a pool a ball to make myself comfy during labour but instead was in a room with others with just a curtain separating me no privacy and no care. I’m absolutely devastated I didn’t get a choice as I wanted a water birth but wasn’t even given the option to choose when I was there then to top it off after giving birth I had to wait 24 hours later for my son to be seen to before we could even go home. You can blame covid all you like. But I am appalled by the lack of care and compassion some off your staff have towards patients especially in there time off need. The women who delivered my child was probably the best person in the place! And thank god I was given her as she was the only person who believe me when I told her my son was on the way! Within 15 minutes off that he was out.",2
"Went to A&E for a minor injury that needed an x-ray, was there less than 1.5hours. The staff were so friendly and efficient.",5
"When i have arrived at the hospital one of the midwife assistant left me to wait even though i was ready to give birth , after 30 minutes another midwife came to assist me and she put in a room to analyse what the situation with the baby and quickly assigned me with midwife Karen , who she was amazing from start to finish , my baby was delivered in 4 hours and i did water birth , she took care i was in good health and my baby as well, thank you for my amazing baby delivery midwife Karen 😊",4
"Husband was brought to a+e last night with a suspected stroke,  he was assessed, blood's taken and a brain scan done within an hour, taken by ambulance to Fairfield where they have stroke unit where he remains now awaiting mri scan,  we cannot thank NHS staff enough at n.m.g.h for their fast and extremely important quick turnaround which has probably saved my Husband from any permanent damage. Hoping to have him home tomorrow. Thank you so much for your excellent care and efficient service ❤",5
"Amazing staff, especially Steve! We were seen almost immediately, had to return several times for after care and was seen quickly all times even when struggling with covid patients. Amazing service, just a shame our gp can't offer the same level of care and we have to use the walk in  instead of our gp service.",5
A&E is a joke. Rude staff. Obviously short staffed. Dirty A&E. Dirty toilets in A&E.,1
"I do not recommend this hospital my boyfriend waited with kidney pain there 8 hours when he asked for a painkiller he did not get it after 8 hours I called the hospital saying that my boyfriend waited there for 8 hours and they didn't even do anything the lady said he had a blood test done where it was a lie  he came to the reception desk and showed his hands that he did not have a NATO blood test !!!! we will report it, for sure I have recordings of talking to you and him",1
I was in the Radiology department and was looked after by a young gentleman radiographer called Fida. He was very professional and made me feel at ease. What a lovely young lad.,5
"I was seen today by Ged in the walk in centre.
I have to say that he was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
after glass was bedded under my nail ( I was petrified ) he made me feel at ease, I even got a song out of him!

Thank you so much.",5
I'm so glad and happy with all the midwife and doctors over ther.They very supportive and nice explain evrything during my pregnancy. I can wait to delivery my daughter over ther.,5
"My gp has referred me to the A&E for kidney stones he has wrote a letter explaining my symptoms and recent health history. (Otherwise I never go there)When arrived At the A&E I had temperature of 39C. I was shivering and in severe pain. The triage service was quite fast and took my bloods and gave me a paracetamol  drip to relieve my pain and temperature. However after this I had to wait almost 8 hours to be seen by a doctor, In the waiting room. When finally I got to see the doctor and finished the consultation with him he has sent me back to the waiting room. After another hour the doctor has took me into a A&E cubical I have received one dose of antibiotics and nothing else for the fast 7 hours. I was in so much pain but not even one of the A&e nurses came to see me In the 7 hours that I’m here.When I have asked the nurse for a pain relief she has told me she will get me some after waiting for about an 1 hour and my pain getting worse  I have asked for it again the nurse started being rude and shouting at me to get back in my cubical and shut up. Other staff members got involved and told max weh e To get back into the cubical after 5 mins the nurse came in a threw the pracetmol at me. The nurses name is Ruth she was the one in charge in a&e when I tried to complain about her they refused to give me her surname. Overall the A&E staff in this hospital are Cooky careless and useless. Never again will I fo to this hospital !!!",1
THE worst medical service I have ever attended. 12 hour wait in A&E with the most insensitive horrid staff members. I never slam NHS workers but this hospitals staff are disgusting and no efforts FYI there we’re 7 people in the waiting room and there was a 12 hour wait,1
My  child experience of inpatient department was very good. All the staff members  are very helpful and caring. I give a big hand to all the staff members  and appriciate their team work.,5
My name is sam kenyon my wife Samantha Kenyon (France) is currently a patient on the postnatal ward after giving birth to our daughter just want to say a massive thank you to all the midwives doctors and nurses for doing an amazing job looking after my wife and daugher.,5
"In 2022 you would like to think if your have a baby , who needs medical attention as your GP has told you to go to A&E! You wouldn’t think waiting to see a doctor for 6 hours is acceptable! NHS is in a very bad way , and I can honestly say we won’t ever return to this hospital again ! We have taken out private health care since , after this terrible experience. I don’t know why it’s in such a mess? Maybe the fact we are a tiny island but are massively overpopulated and the NHS has had the life sucked out of it in recent years !!",1
"Please expect at least 10h wait and rude service, if you are not from English background. 4 times from 5 the answer to simple question would be given lie or no particular answer. If you think that you might need surgeon advice PLEASE TAKE EVERYTHING YOU WOULD TAKE FOR WEEKEND LONG CAMPING! please take phone charges, food, drink, extra clothing and some painkillers if you need, as surgeon is a mystical creature in this hospital : every one talks about surgeon, refers to him/her, but no one know where he/she is or when he/she will see you!  Infinite waiting times! Rude nurses!",1
The people who run the Lilac Centre are very unorganised and disrespectful. I showed up to a 9am appointment to be told 1.5 hours later the Doctor would not be showing up. Waste of time. Rescheduled to two weeks later and called at 10am to check my 11am appointment was still scheduled and there were no delays or waiting times. I showed up promptly at 11am to wait a further 45 mins. Very inconsiderate.,1
"👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This hospital is awful. Wouldn’t recommend and also doesn’t deserve a one star. Came with chest pain and it’s causing some breathing too fast. The nurse called me in and asked me what happened and I told her that the ambulance sent of what happened. She was mean very unhelpful. I was in pain and couldn’t speak too much. She waited silently and then said loudly it’s 1AM if you don’t tell me what happened then you won’t be seen. Then I couldn’t speak then she went to check for the document that the ambulance sent. Then I had a panic attack because of her actions. It looked like she didn’t want to work. Very mean towards patients. definitely would not go back. You have to wait for hours to be seen. Hours by meaning of like 8-10 hours.",1
"My daughter Izabella was born here a few hours ago, we were sent to NMGH from St Mary's hospital for labour induction following reduced movement, due to availability issues at St Mary's , so we had never been to this hospital before and we were quite anxious. Then midwife Rachel came and helped us settle in after almost 5h wait due to emergencies, thank you Rachel. Our biggest thanks go to midwife Vivian, who was with us untill and after birth, what an amazing person she is, my wife felt so reassured all the way through thanks to her, Vivian was exeptional and we will remember her, thank you so much Vivian.",5
"To the Day Surgery Unit @ NMGH, thank so much for doing an absolutely amazing job in looking after my Mum who came in for a lumpectomy yesterday. The patient care was second to none, you are all stars! 🌟👏 And also a big shout out to the breast unit who rang this morning to check she was doing okay, fabulous service 😊👍🌈 💙",5
My friends baby was in nic unit for 6 days the staff were amazing and some were ok I have to say that the student nurse qas amazing nothing was to big for natlie she explained about the machines that was recording Henry's oxygen natlie showed respect to my friend and my self I wish natlie all the best in her next 9 weeks. I would also like to thank Sophie elliot she was amazing with us I couldn't thank her enough your a fab midwife if I could have another baby I would want to come her,5
"The hospital is poorly run and the staff dont have a clue what they are doing, and they are so rude. Waited 7 hours to be seen to by a doctor then all they did was not even clean my wound or even give me any advice and not even check my wound proper, just put a plaster on it and thats it. All that time i have been waiting and i could of done that at home. I wouldn't even give them one star. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!!!! ⛪️❌️",1
Came for a ultrasound scan.there is no parking all the parking are full.couldnt attend to the scan on time.need to arrange more spece for the parking.really unhappy with this.,2
"My 75 year old mum was seen in a&e (02/02/22) after falling onto concrete and having hip and shoulder pain They sent her home with ibuprofen gel and said it was bruising!
The next day,when she couldn't walk, I took her back and we had an xray....oh and a BROKEN PELVIS!!!!She was told no one could accompany her on her first visit yet when I took her no one said anything.Had I attended the first time, I couldve prompted them to look at her history and see that just 3 years previous she had fallen and suffered a broken spine and pelvis!!!The staff were actually really lovely and kind but this should never happen.",1
"Had a chest drain inserted and was left for 1 hour with no pain medication whatsoever and my bed bell turned off, had to ring the ward off my own phone to get attention. Was also rushed in today with suspected sepsis from my chest drain as it has gone green, was left in waiting room for 5 hours, when seen they put the same dressing I arrived with back on looked at me for under 1 minute and told me to go home. No pain meds no advice no care. Walked home at 1:42am for 3 miles when supposed to be on 1 month bedrest. I asked for transport none provided. Gone home feeling exactly the same as when I arrived. I will never come back to this hospital absolutely deplorable. MRI it is for me now.",1
"Only been as an outpatient so far. Staff are always very professional, kind and polite. Parking can be an issue as it's very busy but no different than other hospitals.",5
"Currently living through my worst hospital visit ever. Even a one star is far too generous for this place. Perhaps I'm a little sleep deprived to write anything coherent but here goes nothing. Got here after 3.30am with an ambulance because my pregnant cousin had vomited blood and wasn't talking because she felt there was something lodged in her throat. Given all her vital signs were normal including heart rate and oxygen level, the staff we saw us treated her with a degree of sceptism. Very quickly she became a non priority to them and was moved to a different waiting area where the average waiting time was six hours. They promised us she'd be getting some bloods taken - this didn't happen until 8am this morning. Since then nothing concrete has been done in terms of treatment - we were recently moved from one of the cubicles in the wards to wait for blood test results. That was over an hour ago. It's now 12.51pm and we are still waiting to be called regarding the results /treatment. Also, it's freezing here making the whole experience much worse!",1
Very good treatment by all the departments I attended,5
"I had my son here in February. Came to the AnE in August. Was worried about the unavailability of specialist doctors which delays in getting intensive health care urgently.
They sincerely tried and gave their best to me. Thank you to everyone that supported me during my stay",4
Visited after a horrible fall . Very good response  always felt looked after  and professional care .  doctor whom stitched my wound so gentle  nurses and others really helped me with leg thank you .,5
"Maxillofacial department is a joke. I travelled half an hour for my appointment just so they can tell me that it was cancelled but nobody let me know. Receptionist blaming ""booking centre"" saying ""I can see the letter was produced"", receptionist basically wasn't even able to tell if the letter was actually sent but only ""produced"" absolute time wasters, the wound is not healing great and seems there is a little infection but they postponed the appointment by another one month because doctor is on annual leave. Shocking.",1
"How inept is the NHS especially this hospital , waiting 8 hours to be seen by a doctor , some people waiting 10 hours . You can tell it's poorly ran and understaffed . Be prepared to be in a waiting room at A&E with absolutely no seating and no staff. Clearly the worst wait times ive experienced , go somewhere else.",1
"I've had the best maternity care I could have hoped for, including obstetrics and pediatrics teams. The doctors and nurses went out of their way to make us comfortable and explain everything. Baby needed NICU and staff involved us in all his care and kept us informed at all times. Could not recommend more highly. I felt safe and sincerely cared for. Also very impressed by how natural childbirth, skin to skin, breastfeeding etc are encouraged without preaching.",5
"In December 2020 i came to the A&E after heavy bleeding due to a misscarridge, the staff were sympathetic and understanding. They checked everything blood pressure, bloods, heart rate, oxygen levels, everthing. I was given a bed and cubical and tablets to slow the bleeding as i passed out 3 times they were on hand and very quick in helping me. Once my bleeding was slower and i had gathered my strength they sent me home this was about 8 hours.

I was later back in A&E in January 2021 with heart palpatations and high blood pressure. I had an ECG, bloods and chest xray. They diagnosed me with stress and anxiety i was sent home with care being transferred to my doctors. Even though i was afraid i was having problems with my heart their diagnosis was spot on. I can not thank them enough x",5
My sisters in hospital I went to visit her but they kicked me out cos I’m 17 and then a child was buzzing the nurse (bare in mind I’m on a Children’s ward) and she just said “who keeps buzzing all she wants is attention” and then proceeded to stomp off. I was in royal Manchester childrens hospital last year and they was perfect this in comparison is awful. My sister is here because she’s been having seizures and they aren’t doing anything about it it’s stupid. Would not recommend.,1
"I agree with some of the opinions here-even 1 star is far too good for this hospital. Twice dismissed my 4 year old daughter, after over 6 hours waiting, with breathing difficulty, saying there's nothing wrong with her, and both times she ended up taken by ambulance later, once from home second time from walk-in centre while looking for second opinion, to another hospital with too low oxygen levels and too fast heartbeat.
We just moved to Manchester from London, and used to have there one not very efficient hospital, that everyone moaned about, but this one exceeds anything!!!
If you are able to avoid this hospital-please do so at any cost!!!",1
visited A & E on Monday about 10'30am was sent to the waiting room and called to a triage nurse within 10 minutes discussed my problem was sent for an x ray within 10/15 minutes got the results given exercises to do and told to make an appointment with physiotherapist which I did for Friday discussion with physio given exercises to do and made another a[[ointment for 10 days time. The staff couldn't have been more helpful and the whole experience was simple and quick well done staff at north Manchester General one very satisfied patient xx,5
"The only time I have ever felt the need to criticize any NHS service.
The lack of communication and passage of information in this place is an absolute disgrace. My father an 82 year old with dementia about to be discharged by nurse from the hospital unsupervised. When we refused and finally spoke to a doctor we were informed he wasn't due to be discharged at all and the nurses had it wrong.
No bed rails or dementia indicator on info board, found my father half out of bed opposite the nurse station. No one noticed.
I strongly believe he has been written off by the staff here due to age and dementia.
Was in for kidney and bladder issues but mentally is 10 times worse since he arrived. Possibly exhaustion due to 11 hours lying in corridors.
A disgrace.",1
"During a recent stay on Ward D6 following surgery for cancer I cannot praise the staff too highly, the level of care I experienced was first class, at all times I was kept fully informed of my treatment and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. The food was pretty good and appetising and the ward and other rooms used by patients were clean and well presented,.
All the staff took time out of their busy day to talk to you and explain procedures and treatments being given, I was treated as an individual and not just 'a patient'.
All the staff were cheerful, approachable and really helpful.",5
Staff get their catalytic converters nicked and attempted muggings happening in the car parks constantly. They’re just trying to do their jobs. Management doing nothing about it because they don’t care. Appalling.,1
"I came to the hospital pregnant, with a sharp pain in the stomach, crying because of the pain, I have been waiting for the doctor to see me for 5 hours.  and still no one has even accepted me.  even if you die right in them on a chair, no one will notice",1
"Don't waste your time in this hospital.  After 4 hours of waiting we were sent home with an open head wound that was bleeding !!!!  They still talking about some specialist who will treat you, but you will never see him.  Catastrophic healthcare.",1
I attended A&E Saturday evening what a sham I'm a recovering cancer patient experiencing severe kidney pain on immune suppressant therapy waited 4 hours no Dr no blood test results asked for the sample pot for urine 4 hours later she comes with sorry I forgot needless to say this is why this hospital has the worst ratings in the northwest i will go MRI from now on. The coordinator sat 9n her behind not coordinating a thing a joke,1
"Negative points.

The toilets are filthy.

The Gallery Restaurant is average at best. Bland food, that is also a tad expensive.

Doctors seem rushed off thier feet and keep patients waiting for ages.

The lifts are always breaking down.

The receptionists seem to think they own the wheelchairs, and often tell you you can't take one for a patient.

Good points.

A good bus service.

Conclusion.

This hospital needs to take a look at itself.",1
Can’t really fault the hospital or the staff. The reason I marked it down is purely because I spent 45 minutes driving round looking for a parking space not a single space anywhere apart from the staff car parks didn’t want to risk getting a ticket so ended up parking on the street across the road from the hospital which is permit holders or no return in three hours not ideal if I had an appointment need to be more parking spaces available for the public,1
"The orthodontic team here is second to none. I have been looked after by them for several years now, following some work needed to correct an overbite and restorative dentistry due to trauma.

I have found them to be caring and professional. Communication in this team is superb. Any problems with my mouth have been picked up by them and dealt with quickly.

We are nearing the end of my treatment now and the results of their work is astonishing. I am so lucky to have been looked after by such skilled individuals.",5
"A&E dept is lacking in care empathy and absolutely no comfort for poorly people. I spent 10 hours there without seeing a doctor ,l had no money, my car ticket was a bout to run out we had to leave untreated. i witnessed no care from the supposedly caring NHS, id die at home before id go there again.when i enqired  ""what time would i bee seen"" I was told how longs a piece of string"" ,very professional answer.  No applause from me definately not

""",1
"Was under the care of  Ben from the physio team with severe shoulder pain. Very caring attitude, very understanding. Explained the best way to cope with the pain & help Me get back to work.  He called Me  back after a couple of wks  to ensure I was doing well, & to tell me to get in touch If need help again.  :-)",5
"The staff here are a credit to the NHS. Was well looked after coming in with kidney stones. Was in agonising pain and was seen to very very quickly. The place is crazy busy with people waiting for beds. It was crazy to learn that our hospitals get fined £5000 ...yes £5000 per patient who are not seen to in A&E within a 4 hour time zone. The council should be asking themselves how this is right to charge when the staff are run off their feet! Nothing was too much to ask, was monitored by genuine caring people. A few special gems work here who kept me calm whilst in agony. Thank you all!!",5
"Incredibly lovely reception staff, nurses and radiologists. I have a history of breaks so went just to be certain I hadn't done too much damage, everyone was so lovely and treated my condition seriously and with respect. Was in and out within 2 hours. Fun fact, if you're a nice friendly person, maybe they'll be similarly nice in return!",5
"This hospital car park is better now that visiting times are varied, the pay machines are by reg numbers and now will take cash and card payments, because this hospital is part of the ""Pennine Trust"" you could be sent to other Hospitals for treatment but NOT everyone has access to car use and could be difficult to get to via a bus. Staff are friendly and helpful.",4
I wonder why they mix 16 year olds with adults 😳.,1
This hospital is an absolute disgrace. After being unwell for a year my GP referred me to the infectious disease clinic at this hospital regarding possible Lyme disease. After waiting a few months I finally got an appointment. The doctor I saw was very friendly and understanding and ordered a whole series of blood tests to investigate. Unfortunately that was as far as it went. I returned a month later to get my results only to be told they hadn't done them due to human error. I accepted the doctors apology and they took my bloods again. A few weeks later I have been informed by email that they have messed up my tests again and that I've been referred back to my GP. Given how long I have been unwell and that I could have a potentially life threatening illness this level of care is not only unacceptable it is dangerous. I wouldn't trust this hospital with anything. I'd give less than one star but this option isn't available. Avoid this hospital if you can.,1
"People can die here !!! Honestly. Imagine that you had a cyst blown up in stomach. And had a pain and in such cases there is a emergency surgery. But if we had that for example we could die because its  a matter of couple hours to make the surgery - its urgent. But we are still here for second hour and they still not seeing us. !!!!!!!!!!!!

The whole medicine is ridiculous.",1
"Toilets at the main entrance are disgusting! Disabled one flooded all over the floor and toilet blocked.
Womens toilets filthy and no toilet roll at all! No excuse of its a weekend they should be kept clean and monitored.",1
Went from A&E to being admitted for three days and received excellent care throughout my time at the hospital. The only negative was having to wait three hours for a bed before I could be admitted.,4
"My Father is in hospital since Monday, and during this time he has had a bleed overnight from a cannula. On Friday afternoon it was indicated he would be discharged, but suddenly no. This was accepted, but at 2am this morning he was transformed to another ward, no contact to inform his daughter, and lack of communication continued throughout. I have spent eight hours there today waiting for communication as to whether he would be discharged. A Doctor eventually arrived around 3pm took blood and said he would have results in an hour, then never returned. Then my father was put to bed, with no answers.... if this was any other organisation a lack of communication is unacceptable so why should it be acceptable in the NHS. My father has stated he believes he is imprisoned",3
"Dreadful experience. Empty waiting room but still had to wait to see the specialist even though the nurse and specialist were hanging around.
Then sent for a blood test and still have the bruise 2 weeks later!! Why didn't the initial nurse do it instead of making me wait 1h more! How inefficient! Uncaring staff lets the place down.
Hospital needs a lot of money invested and much better management to optimise the inefficiencies that are numerous.",1
"Couldn’t believe what I was seeing.. A&E was bedlam, immigration nation.. all of them couldn’t speak English as I was sat near reception I could hear every one of them saying they didn’t work, going to A&E for a cough and  diarrhoea.. No masks on considering it’s a covid pandemic whilst coughing everywhere.. waiting times was ridiculous because of this.. i know our NHS is free and it’s for everyone, but surly there has to be some sort of procedure where if you’re problem that isn’t that serious you can go to a pharmacy and buy some cough medicine and diarrhoea sachets?..  rather than waste resources by waiting to get a free prescription.. or 111 for example..",1
Very good experience staff excellent doctors great to,5
Hospital itself is pretty good but I’ve marked it down due to the fact that there was nowhere to park. All patient car parks were full and lots of people driving around trying to find a space. Luckily I got there very early so made my appointment just in time but if I’d have been in a hurry or an emergency it would’ve been a nightmare!,3
"not a pleasant place to visit , there are suggestion boxes in reception but no pens or paper to report ? .",2
Been here several times for surgery. The staff are simply amazing. Cant do enough for you. Big shout out to the lady and gent in the discharge ward who im currently in with. Been a silly busy weekend and they are bending over backwards to get me home safe. Xxxxx,5
"I went here for heart palpitations, came in the middle of the night after being in bed for 30 minutes, I was breathing normally (even slower to try slow my heart rate) however I had severe heart palpitations, blurry/shaky vision, legs and jaw was shaking involuntary and looked extremely pale. they made me wait 10 hours in the waiting room while this was ongoing for 8 hours. finally got an ecg, which showed a long q-t on there, now that is no where to be found on my records. the junior doctor checked to see if it was caused by an infection like laryngitis. told me and my mum “well it’s definitely not laryngitis” after checking. He put on my records it was laryngitis. my bpm was 130 when they finally checked (normally it’s 75). came in a second time same thing, was made to wait 9 hours in the waiting room. gave me a heart monitor which showed irregular heart beats and 214 bpm in my sleep. they do not diagnose me or tell me what is wrong, but keep suggesting it could be because of stress, or alcohol or drugs, (I had never drank or taken drugs when I came in the first, second & during the heart monitor test & I was always relaxed, sometimes even sleeping when I had heart palpitations) I told them this but they said they do not know, and now that is all. no diagnosis. nothing. absolutely horrible hospital. thanks for reading 👍🏼",1
Once again (most recent visit before this was 18 months ago) I had reason to rush my husband into a&e.     Can't fault them  possibly wards could be a bit cleaner but we all know how the NHS is struggling.  They all do a great job under very difficult circumstances and dealing with the general public nowadays can be very challenging at times.  The ambulance paramedics did a wonderful job too and arrived quite quickly to our home and although my husband has only had a suspected stroke I feel that they did everything they could and have now sent him to the stroke unit in Fairfield Hospital to make doubly sure of the diagnoses.,5
I had a very bad injury in my knee and all my body. But in the hospital  nobody ask if I'm ok or I need  blanket or water.Waiting for someone from 6pm till 11.30 pm with big bleeding. I left this hospital 1.30am next day 25.12. without shoe and jakect.  Nursery was very ignorant and nasty.  Very bad experience,1
"Absolutely appalling. A&E over an hour to be triaged with a young man who threatened suicide and then cut himself so deeply tendons were showing. I have had nothing but bad experiences at this hospital over the last 25 years from A&E, maternity and the care of the elderly.  The occasional staff member does their job but they are few and far between.Their independent report said they needed improvement! I don't don't care what reason is offered for a poor hospital the truth is excuses are no use when you are dead.",1
Terrible hospital. Neglect younger patients under claims of attention seeking. Nursing staff on wards with older patients are neglectful and steal from patients. Only safe places are the critical wards. Even then expect neglect if you're younger as they'll believe you're attention seeking. Busy flirting with ambulance staff instead of saving patient lives. One of the worst hospitals in Manchester,1
"Long waiting times, emergencies arent treated as emergency, had to spend 7 hours to get somewhere. At the end of the day, told to wait in the waiting room to receive my medicine, we waited and waited and guess what? They forgot about us being there. Another half an hour wasted. Its been really stressful experience whenever I visited this hospital.",1
"The medical staff are polite and do so much despite being rushed off their feet. Now for the down side, the waiting room & toilets were filthy. None of the vending machines were working. The heater above the door was blowing hot even though it was hot outside. The admin staff aren't helpful and I have never known a clinic to run on time. If it wasn't for the doctors and nurses I would have given it a score of 1. Would it pass the friends & family test - not in its current state.",2
A and E is always busy you can wait hours to be seen. The department needs more chairs for sick people to sit down. There's not enough space me and others were sat outside. Therefore you carnt hear you name being called.just make it a little bigger. 😕,3
"Absolutely no communication . Sent to a surgical unit  after 4 hours in A & E . Told to go home after being there for 4 more hours and to come back for a scan in 2 days . Went for the scan and told I need admitting . Spent the night listening to nursing bitching about each other . Told I was bill by mouth when I wasn’t and only offered male catheters to use , was told I was having a CT scan for kidney stones , promised the doctor was coming from 3pm one day and he still hadn’t arrived by lunch the next day then I was told I can just go home and come back for a CT scan within 2 weeks even though the doctor did not see me .This is half of the problems I encountered in there .
Some of the nursing staff on this ward are great but some should not be in that job . The doctors just lie to your face and the food is vile .",1
"Extremely bad service specially staff who's on duty today 1 midwife is been horrible,even after calling through buzzer not coming for help .
My baby is polly, I got discharged 2 days ago after c section not recovered yet and unfortunately had to come here wth little 1 for keeping him under photo therapy. I pressed the buzzer so I need 1 mask for him to protect his eyes but no 1 even bothered to come and see us.",1
My daughter had an operation two days ago .. all staff where brilliant ... my partner was terminally ill he had a few stays here again they where brilliant. He unfortunate passed away over a year ago he spent the last 3 weeks in Christie Manchester... they need to take a leaf out of north Manchester book didn't compare at all to the staff at north Manchester... well done to the caring staff at North Manchester x,5
"After the difficult year we (and the NHS) have had, i was deeply saddened to hear of nursing staff at this hospital jerring, publicly criticising and being aggressive with police for attending a call.

Thats behaviour for common scallys not professionals with status in society. Police arent there to be treated like that by NHS staff. NHS staff save lives, Police risk their lives to save lives!",1
"My father was recently treated and admitted for 2nights after becoming unwell, the overall care and treatment from the paramedics to the nursing team and other relevant professionals in both a and e and the ward was excellent and. Thank you for the support provided under so much pressures and cutbacks",5
"The staff on ward E3 are excellent. My mum was there for two weeks before she passed away on February 4, 2014. She refused to be transfered as she felt she was getting the best treatment possible. Patient and visitors were treated with tenderness and dignity.",5
"Overall service was great. Well, except receptionist behaviour. When I’ve told her I don’t have emergency contact number she said: wow, that’s bizarre.
We don’t know other people life situation. What kind of comment is that?!",1
"Following Ambulance transfer we arrived at A&E approx 1130hrs. Suspected heart attack. Moved about to various cubicles ecg and bloods done in first few hrs. They said my blood Hb count was very low. They flagged this as VERY dangerous. So we expected some medical activity. 1800hrs moved to resus got a cup of tea and sandwiche, after asking. Then saw two doctors who told me again what was needed. Still nothing actually medical was done to me. Self discharge approx 2130hrs. The area was very poorly managed, no visible structure or purpose. Absolutely terrible staff to patient interaction. COME ON NHS GET A GRIP. Nobody wants privatisation...but you need a buisness ethic if you are to succeed, not silly meaningless flowery mission statements.",1
Reception staff on xray was very rude and arrogant. Staff doing xray was amazing but your already angry after being disrespected by the reception staff.,2
"Staff Extremely rude, They don't take the time to listen, they where just using their mobile phone. To many staff
standing around. Extremely unwelcoming
Language barriers. Don't seen to care ...",1
"If you want to spend the last hours of your life and your last breath in the hospital, it is a hospital you can choose. It may take hours to reach the doctor while in pain, if you are lucky. 3 shifts have changed while waiting.",1
Thank you so much for looking after me! You are truly heroes in my eyes.,5
Absolute quality team! Big mention to MADDY! On the A&E crew. Completely removed my fear of hospitals and is a credit to the nhs! Best professionalism ive experienced in a hospital under the circumstances they are under. Thanks guy and your defo worth more than 15% rise i believe the right figure should be 20% minimum. 🙌🏾😎wez,5
"They leave wheelchair bound people waiting in the coridoor in AnE for hours on end without being seen to. My dad went in at 3pm and is still there waiting to have another cathetor in its currently 9;30pm Been left in piss since 3pm. No beds no one to see to him. Keep saying one person infront of you then adding more onto the list. Hes in pain as been left in his chair to long and has brain damage so hes agitated and stressed and wants to come back home. He was there last night aswell and they left him there till 5am in his chair aswell without a cathetor replaced without being seen to, there for being told there is no hoist to transport him into a stretcher bed and clearly he cant walk or understand why people are leaving him like this. I am not very happy with how this hospital has been and never seems to change anything people report. He has the worst experiance every time he has to be sent there and some of the staff in the past have been horrible and useless. The staff keep complaining towards my dad saying there are people infrount of him but it only takes a couple of mins to re cathitirise someone even if that means asking someone from a different ward to come down and do it or put him im a ward then let him come home after its done like people do in mri. Not to be told there will be a hoist waiting for him and to be seen as soon as he can as his bladder is killing him coz they left him 2 days without fixing it. And leaving him left in a wheelchair with osteophosis all day and night in pain and piss.",1
"Missed out on t the breakfast, which I’ve got to say hits a spot. So had the chicken tikka , not bad, but a little bland, I want more pep. Good price, good people.👌",5
"I cant fault the nurses on my ward, but went in on a sunday to get checked for dvt, and I was there till wednesday when it turns out the scan showed no dvt, on the monday I could've been sent home but no one came to see me for 2 days to give me simple plaster to cover my stitches coming out also on the monday, think they either dont care or are clearly incompetent.wouldnt have done this review but feel you  personally need to know how you can get treated. Very disappointed in being an unnecessary drain on the nhs. P.S I actually might not even get out on Wednesday, depends if I get ignored again 🙄",2
My Aunt was admitted into J6 on Friday morning . She was very poorly . She’s now home and still not well but not as poorly ! The staff have looked and cared for her amazingly ! There’s been a few ups and downs but that’s the system not the staff ! Thank you J6 for looking after Sheila like you have done . Take care xx Maria God Bless xx,5
Went to this hospital last nite with my 10 week old grandson because he was poorly we were in the children's department and think we may have come out of there with more illnesses than we went in with.  In one corner there was 3.sick bowels on The floor we were there  for nearly 3 hours and they were still there when we left. Also the floor and the tables were  full of rubbish and empty calpol seringes just everywhere and a small what looked like oxygen mask. I no the NHS is under pressure but come on basic things like shifting sick bowels should be standard. I would also like to say it wouldn't hurt for the scruffy lazy people who take there children there for help and think  it is all the job of the staff to clean up for them disgusting god nos wot there houses are like. On the good side we were seen by a very helpful doctor and nurse so thanku to them.,1
A&E department were amazing and saw my daughter really quickly and even offered her a meal. Really nice experience after hearing so much bad :-),5
"Our little darling was admitted to the childrens ward  recently and spent 3 nights in there. Right from childrens a&e to the kaola unit our darlings care was exceptional and thorough. In the childrens department our darling was very taken care and the nurses on bay 2 are wonderful. They took care of not only our darling but us has family always asking of we needed anything. The ward was cleaned daily and during our darlings recent stay they had a magician visit to all the children. If anything some patients need to sort themselves out and  not have the whole families stay whilst they have poorly children in the unit, disgraceful. Also turn off your phone or put it on silent during late hours.",5
"Do not take any elderly relatives here for care!

On the ward a relative is on, the staff nurses are so incompetent over the basic of things.

Not having a nil by mouth sign up or on someone’s notes, but expect the doctor to assume they are nil by mouth and don’t tell the visiting family until we enquired...

If you can’t do the basics right, don’t work in a job in which the basics are essential....",1
"Went a and e, sent to outpatients as trialing a new a and e for less severe cases, was seen within 5 minutes. Doctor very friendly. Had to go for xray. There about 30 mins in total; back to see doctor and was seen straight away. Was a few people in the waiting room but saw two doctors in the department, could have been more. From the times i have been NMGH, the staff seem to be nice and generally helpful.",5
"Attended the Koala Unit 17/11/17 with my grandson. His care was excellent from start to finish. Dr. Yousef and Dr. Mohammad were exceptional as were the nurses and a big thank you to Joanna Hunt ( on reception) for being so thoughtful and attentive. Best N
HS experience in 47 years.  They have team work spot on.",5
"Absolutely disgraceful.
No communication. You call to find out how your very sick relative is .
They get patients mixed up   give you false info and then at times the phone isn't even answered.
No faith in their care at all",1
Good and bad . Waiting times crazy . And after care good when finally get treated.,3
"The worst hospital ever, took my nephew with finger cut and been waiting 6 hours. We left 1 month baby at home and staff said you can leave if you want to.",1
I got a chance to stay with my child in the children ward in dec 2015. The doctors were very good but nursing staff Uncooperative except a few nurses. An evening time nurse even didn't bother to give antibiotic medicine properly who was severe sick and also did not give milk for him and we had to make our own arrangement by giving him powder milk which make his conditions worse. Next morning a good nurse fed him properly. The doctors discharged us at 2 clock but the staff asked us to wait for child's medicine before go home home and it took 5 hours to arrive from the inside lloyds pharmacy to us. The parent tea area was not properly maintained without sugar and tea bags.,1
"Terrible parking, you have to drive around for 30 minutes to try and find a parking place, no wheelchairs at the entrances and I could not find Amy so my Father had to struggle to walk not only from carpark but along the naze of corridors, The staff are nice but otherwise its a terrible place.",2
"Children's A&E department staff were very rude, waiting room lack of seating in a boiling room, for hours on end. Men's toilet no running water in the tap. Dirty and messy. Just totally unacceptable. Parking meter doesn't accept notes or cards and can't pay by phone. Shame and disgrace to a UK hospital, worse than a 3rd world hospital. TIME FOR CHANGE NOW",1
"Avoid the A & E department, been here for three hours now, placated with blood tests. Presented with a head injury that needs either stitching or glue, no one has even looked or ask about the patients head or how the injury happened. At no point have we been informed as to what is happening, I suspected largely as they don’t know themselves, overall very disheartening and frustrating, no awareness/regard for anyone else’s time but their own. Serious intervention/investigation into, performance, effectiveness and service needs to happen.",1
"Bronwyn went in on Thursday Morning to Antenatal Ward. The Midwifes, Docters, Anethetist, every single person there was utmost friendly and extremely professional. She had epidural which worked fantastic! There was two people permanently with her, monitoring everything and explaining what is happening. Saturday night she was moved into theatre for C Section. A 4.4kg baby was born 9.10pm. on 15/11/19 She was moved back to Postnatal ward where she was once again looked after brilliantly! She was afterwards visited again by the Anethetist, midwifes, pediatrian and mommy and baby was thoroughly examined again and again and we went home Sunday afternoon. I cannot fault this hospital on anything! I am still talking about the great care patients in maternity ward receives. A huge thankyou to the whole team involved you are  absolutely brilliant. Thankyou from myself Mariette and my daughter Bronwyn Potgieter.",5
My wife was hit by a car while she was riding a bike. At first the hospital took us to Salford hospital and she was given morphine and liquid paracetamol and then discharged in about 8 hours. 2 days later situation got worse and she had to go to this crumpsall hospital as it closest. She spend 9 hours crying out of pain and only at 6th hour of waiting and postponing her request to take a look at her. She was finally booked for a CT scan and after she had it she  waited 3 more hours for results but could not take it anymore because ALL THE DAMN DOCTORS KNOW NOTHING AND DO NOTHING. LITERALLY JUST SAYING WAIT 5 MIN OR 10 OR 15 THEN COMES BACK IN AN HOUR AMD EVERY TIME THE SAME. We achieved nothing in the end and she went home to finally eat something and get some sleep... Shittiest hospital ever. (Not our first encounter tho),1
"Not been to N.M.G Hospital since my last operation 2017 December I've also worked there from 2001 to 2006 over the years from me as a child to now an Adult
I've seen some changes and all the new builds from children's Hospital being added on because Booth Hall Hospital as now been knocked down.  It's good to have a Hospital in this area because other Hospitals are so far away This Hospital is forever changing and getting bigger and the staff are so loving and caring they all do such amazing things

"Avoid at all costs if you value loved ones.
When we had the misfortune to leave a loved one in their care ,Without any consultation with the family they decided to issue a DNR and this was discovered by pure chance and when this was challenged we were also summarily dismissed as just an annoyance .Absolutely disgusting ,l would never allow a loved one to go there again .NOT SAFE THE CQC SHOULD INVESTIGATE. The indifference is palpable.",1
A lot of bad press on NHS and ‘service’  and wait times. No sign of this at NMGH today. I was advised to go to A& E by the local walk in centre to rule out a broken bone in my hand. I received First class treatment diagnostics & care. Thank you NMGH A&E. Receptionist Paul the nurse on duty & the lovely radiographer in The XRay department. Wonderful service and many thanks to you all on what appeared to be a busy day. We are all so very lucky to have you,5
"My sister took my mother 83 here with shortness o breath and low blood pressure in a ambulance.  They are still in the hall way and the paramedics cant leave untill she has been handed over to a doctor...what a bloody shambles,,there lined up the hallway, they have been there since 5pm its now12.30 am...no food or drink offered or any where to get anything . This is more than disgusting this is life threatening,....",1
Car parks are a mess at the moment due to building works. Day services was extremely busy but reception staff were pleasant and helpful,4
Wanted to say thank you to all the amazing staff on ward f3 and everyone else we met in all the clinic appioments .we are all quick to put down the nhs.  but Manchester north general hospital staff really do go above and beyond thank you all for making a scary time much more bearable and a special thank you to the trainee Frankie on f3 you will be an amazing nurse xxx,5

"i worked here it was a good hospital the problem to date is lack of staff especially those who know what to do the out patients dept was very busy. the management at the time was disgraceful moving people around therefore not enough staff getting pt in and out and ensuring they have been cared for . not enough staff at the entrance usually 1-3 therefore people quing lots of services moved out staff going to old ham therefore services going over and patients having to go to Oldham &,bury when your infirm its hideous to send folk miles away staff in general from nmgh are good its outside staff not happy to be here definitely makes for dissent not happy",5

"Went to be tested for Narcolepsy.  Said I don't have it, despite nodding off at least twice during the sleep latency test and being drowsy all day.  Got an off hand letter saying my 'vivid dreams' may be caused by my medication, proving the consuktants hadn't read my notes where I said I had vivid dreams on sleeping (even on fainting and very short naps) since childhood before I ever took medication.  Left me not particular confident in the result.  Now at a loss because the only two conditions that I can find that cause this are Narcolepsy and Severe Depression, neither of which I, apparently, have.

The two stars are for the nursing staff who were superb.",2
"Couldn’t breathe, whilst vomiting, was told an ambulance would be with us in 1h & 45m…. I couldn’t breathe. In that time I could’ve died. We resorted to a faster option, I couldn’t stop vomiting, whilst the receptionist was being rude to my companion who did not speak English very well, asking irrelevant questions which could’ve been asked at a later time when I wasn’t vomiting and the person I was with wasn’t panicking, but I understand certain questions need to be asked in order for me to get help. Waiting hours are insane. But I know that’s no one’s fault. However, when an incident broke out 20+ people came out of the rooms to assist to restrain 1 puny man.When the same people could’ve seen us and the other people around me. I was struggling to stand and asked for a chair during triage… apparently there not supposed to have chairs in there …. Yet the nurse wasn’t even sat on the chair provided for her and could’ve  just gave me that one temporarily… I did not feel safe here. I did not feel cared for untill the very end. There was a nice doctor. I understand night shifts are horrible. And everyone is stressed out and tired & their trying their absolute best. But there is so much more that could be done, basic kindness, better security, people w more empathy. When your not feeling well it is horrible. You just want to crawl up into a ball at least be WARM, the waiting room was freezing. That too I had a blanket over me, that wasn’t even provided by any staff but another patient. NHS really needs help. It really did not need this many staff to accommodate to ONE person being aggressive the man was scrawny. I have a lot of respect for NHS staff, as my own sibling is one. But this was out of order.",1
Partner was in just short of 7 weeks..had emergancy surgery that saved his life was in a coma  on G1 for many weeks carnt thank them enough,5
"Incompetent inexperienced doctors in maternity and paediatric wards. First DD born there junior doctor banged baby's mouth on the edge of the cot when she turned my baby over during rough examination.  Second child almost born at home advised by maternity staff that although my waters had broken, my contractions were not long enough to indicate labour. Born 20 mins after arrival as trainee nurse was filling in forms. On discharge, examined by loco doctor. Initially told me she would take him away to check him over. Had to insist that I wanted to be present. She told me she would hold him whilst I put my slippers on then proceeded out the door calling she was just across corridor. Chased after her and got there just in time as laid him on the the cot. Examined him roughly, I believe they r responsible for the subsequent problems with his hips. Third child born in Luton, gentle examination by kindly staff. No problems. Not recommended. Ensure you have strong support network if you have no choice but to use this ward during this vulnerable time.",1

"Hi my partner recently spent 3 weeks at NMGH, and I would like to thank all the staff involved in his care. He commenced his visit on A&E followed by transfer to Wards E1, Critical Care, J6 and C5. The receptionists, support workers, cleaners, nursing ,and consultancy staff treated both myself and my partner with compassion, respect and the utmost care. Special thanks to Rebecca on E1 for identifying that he required Critical Care support and to Sandra on C5 who, as well as providing excellent care she also provided much needed moral. support.
Kind regards

I came with chest pain’s and short of breath….. I waited for 5 hours and nobody bothered apart from initial  check up at first….

My new born and i was left in a storeroom for recovery. Then my baby went in I c, unit overnight. Never had a security tag on. Local authorities came never said anything about it  and 🌈 rainbow team midwifes. Left with urine infections kidney or liver disease could hardly walk, and threatened by social service s of midwife in didn't attend an appointment 5miles away.

"The current car parking situation needs addressing ASAP, every time I visit this hospital, I spend at least 30 mins driving around looking for a space, you need to add more spaces, I now have to park 20 mins walk away from the hospital and walk in, it’s just not good enough!",1

The midwives and staff were very professional and helpful. I received the best care and was surprised considering so many badmouth the nhs.  The midwife Maria Alvarez (hopefully I got the name correctly) Portuguese was most helpful and made happen for me to deliver a 4.1 kg healthy baby. Words are not enough to express how greatful I am to the whole staff and her for her excellent care. She was with me every minute during labour.  Being my first baby was worried however she was god sent and calmed me down and guided me . I wish all the best to her and her family. Excelent hospital and staff!!!! Wish you all the best.

Terrible experience at this hospital. No compassion for patients in severe pain. I hope I never have to return here.,1
Worst service ever. Waited in a and e for 3 hours and then they told me I was allocated elsewhere 3hours ago so waited for no reason and nobody gave me any updates. Having severe pains in my chest and have a baby at home.,1

"Very rude midwives in maternity ward
I advise patients to take a personal recorder with them.

Also they treat patients like an object and NOT like a human.
They only do what they want to do. They do not give the right to patients to decide about their health.
They speak down on patients and if you question about their actions,, they accuse you of being rude.",1
"North Manchester General Hospital is a large NHS hospital in Crumpsall in the north of the English city of Manchester. It is operated by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust on behalf of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. There is an accident and emergency unit, together with a maternity unit, high dependency unit and a mental health wing. A long-awaited plan to rebuild the hospital was announced publicly by Boris Johnson in the 2019 General Election campaign, and in November 2020 a £54 million funding bid for improvement works was made by the Trust, the city council and Manchester Health and Care Commissioning.

This extensive hospital site originally housed three separate hospitals: Crumpsall Hospital, Delaunays Hospital and Springfield Hospital. The three amalgamated to create North Manchester General Hospital in 1977.

Crumpsall Hospital was built as an infirmary for the Manchester Union Workhouse and opened in 1876.

In 1914 the hospital was a receiving station firstly for 500 casualties from Belgium. By 1924 there was an X-ray department, ear, eye and dental departments and a chiropody room. There were then 4 or 5 resident medical officers, who usually stayed for about 2 years, rotating through the different specialities. In 1927 a new dispensary and a separate block for operating theatres, X-ray, dental and recovery rooms was built.

The Infirmary had 1,440 beds in 1928 with a further 600 in the attached mental department. The patients included both chronic and acute cases and both acute cases and the work of the obstetric and gynaecological department had been increasing. The hospital had a bacteriological and pathological laboratory and was a registered training school for nurses both in general medical and surgical work and in midwifery. in 1929 it became a municipal hospital.

In 1948 the hospital joined the National Health Service. In 1951 a nurses sick bay, a premature babies unit and a new Physiotherapy department were opened. In 1952 the hospital was recognised by Manchester University for clinical teaching and some of the senior medical staff were appointed honorary lecturers.

Delaunays Hospital was designed by Thomas Worthington as a workhouse and hospital for the Prestwich Board of Guardians and opened in 1869. The Prestwich Workhouse and Hospital was absorbed into the Manchester Union Workhouse in 1915.

Crumpsall Hospital, Delaunays Hospital and Springfield Hospital amalgamated to create North Manchester General Hospital in 1977. After the Victoria Memorial Jewish Hospital closed in 1992, the Jewish Victoria Wing was established at the North Manchester General Hospital. Similarly, after the Northern Hospital for Women and Children closed in 1994, women's and children's services were centralised at the North Manchester General Hospital and a new women's and children's block opened in June 2010. Plans to build a new intermediate care centre were announced in 2019.

Since April 2020, the hospital is managed by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust under a management agreement with Northern Care Alliance NHS Group. The NHS Group was formed in 2017 to combine Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust – which previously operated the hospital – with Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust.",5
"I had a 2:50 pm appointment for a chest x-ray. I reported at Reception at 2:30, was seen to straight away and LEFT by 2:50! Incredible service indeed. Thank you!",5
"Absolutely appalling hospital. The treatment I recieved was disgusting, went into a&e unable to walk on my foot to be sent home then refused my results unless I went back to the hospital in the middle of a pandemic! PALS just as appalling when raising the issue. No wonder people are dying if this is the treatment for a fractured foot never mind covid 19",1
"Despite the current desperate state of the NHS & the never ending horror stories, I can only commend the dedication & hard work of the staff on Ward I5.",5
"If I could give 0 stars I would, cancelled surgery 6 times, the care is less than adequate, the hospital is appalling.",1
"A&E was hammered I was waiting 4 1/2 hours to be seen but what a first class service they achieved under the pressure they are under, so many people went before me and that was because of their need for treatment you did a fantastic job and with such good grace. thank you so much xxx",5
"I attended xray department on July 10th for a hip injection. The staff were brilliant, reassuring , explained everything in detail, very professional . Thank you Dr Josh and other two members of staff involved",5
Utter disgrace ! Son went to A&E in great pain . Sent away with gel and told to ring a different surgery . Different surgery said hospital should of rung them not a patient ! It seems covid 19 is a great excuse to cover the bad service most hospitals in Manchester are offering . Not every visit is a covid 19 patient .Neglect is a criminal offence and we should see numerous actions taken against incompetent staff !!,1
I have been in North Manchester Hospital as an inpatient 4 times now . Cannot fault care given on the I 5 &I 6 wards each time. Drs and nursing staff are exellent . Been treated by the outpatient operation now for 8 yrs . Good hospital although a little far for us from Droylsden treatment second to non.xx,4
"Went to A&E this morning at 10am having chest pain i couldn't lift my left arm lots of pain... they did blood test ecg and xray ... then send me to ACU department a male nurse came took some information and ask me if I need painkiller .... a female nurse came with some paracetamol and ask me if I have water I say no she went back to get a cup of water came back put the water on the table and walked...
No one came to do any observation and ask if am OK  the pain was killing me 5.pm I went to look for the nurse to see what is happening she look surprise ask me if I have been seen by the doctor yet I say no one came she ask me my name and went 5.30pm the male nurse came back and said all my test is negative I can go home and do some exercise with your neck and I say are you sure what your saying because the pain is going on the back of my head he said when you go home take some paracetamol every 4 hours.....
Not professional at all not even a doctor  to come and give you an proper outcome about the patients was told to see my GP if the pain continue and my GP they keep sending to A&E  .....
Very poor service.",1
"For that rude and stupid operator behind the phone on Saturday, worse attitude ever. I'ev also complained all over let's hope someone take action. The way she spoke to me was so unacceptable; People like that with such aggressive attitude shouldn't be allowed to work specialy for NHS.",1
The staff are so rude and careless 2 years old suffered cried was left unattended when approached was told can’t help and go to a different hospital… my 3 year old cousin was checked and told he had an ear infection when there was so much more to it and led to a operation & 3 months in hospital!!!,1
very bad experience.  waiting time above 9hours in a&e. patients crying there with pain but no response. fist they told us 5hours waiting then after 5h they told us 4 hours more. 😡,1
"Shocking hospital. Incompetent doctors, nurses  and managers. Had to resort to paying for private care. PALS nicely covered up the true findings with my case. Kept aplogising but ni way forward with reimbursement of monie from serking private treatment. Shameful management. Will never trust then again with such a serious neuralgic problem. Now with a neurosurgeon at Salford who is appalled of care failure and he so concerned about my health that I have an open outpatients appt arrangement with him. NMGH needs closure the quicker the better. No trust.",1
"My 94 year old father, was sent to A&E by the district nurse,  unable to pass water with a blocked catheter and in agony, he was kept waiting 6 hours before he was attended to, and only then after a plea was made to the staff that he was in terrible pain.",1
some of the staff were lovely looked after me really well spoke to me when my anxiety and ADHD was bad overall wasn't happy I took 9 hours to see me after an overdose was left to sleep on the floor till a sister saw me and offered me a bed,2
Wouldn’t come to this hospital again I’m 34 weeks pregnant nothing but neglected done nothing for me for the pains and can’t keep food down and sending me home like this feel so shocking I wouldn’t even come to this maternity hospital it’s absolutely shocking  I wouldn’t even give them a full star or any starts at all the mount of women that has got infections due to neglect,1
"Waited 24 hrs for the ambulance to arrive for my 80 year old mother after she had a nasty fall an cracked her head open, thought this was the end of the nightmare but no we then arrived at North Manchester hospital,booked in at 115 pm for a total of 11 hours we got past from person to person asking the same question again and again  when they should be looking at her medical history on the computer,bear in mind she has altzimers and still has a gaping wound on her head which no one seems to be interested in,the last time my mother had to stay at that place she came out worse then when she went in,one of the problems this hospital has is the amount of people that can't speak good English,it's so important to be able to communicate with the staff and they do seem to have a lazy attitude,they need replacing with hard working English staff.",1
My daughter was transferred here to the children unit my issue is only with the one nurse (Margaret) i just hate when they take their job to far i hope she reads this at some point if so pls get a different job or retire 🙏🙏 absolutely useless... the rest of the staff was brilliant especially night staff...,1
"I went to A&E & waited for 24hrs. This was just bcz i was waiting for a bed, But there was none available in the country. This was all bcz i was told through 111 & they told me to go straight to A&E to go to see & speak with someone from the mental health services.",3
"My daughter is pregnant and suffering severe sickness, she was told she had Ketones in her urine and went for tests.
She's been waiting there for hours and still is there on the floor because there are no chairs left.",2
Great hospital very helpful friendly staff but very very busy A&E depth be prepared for a long wait,4
"Gp called 999 for Ambulance querying a T.I.A said I needed a brain scan, I waited 4 hours and they just did a blood test.
Trolleys filled the corridor, paramedics were due to finish shift so they booked me in and took me round to walk in waiting room. Anyone know if that was the problem?",3
"The difference between NMGH and Salford Royal is vast. The entire exterior and entrances of the hospital are disgusting and littered with cigarette stubs. Some parts of the exterior look more like a disused pub rather than a hospital! Patients and visitors should also take care of their local hospital and not litter the floors, but I guess that's another point of discussion.
We had to transfer from NMGH to SRH when my partner's consultant misplaced his medical records 3 times and turned up late for the clinic on every occasion.
I was also misdiagnosed 3 times by 3 different consultants for a potentially life threatening condition.
Enough is enough. The training, cleanliness and attitudes there need improving",1
"Ridiculous, even there is 1 patient in emergency they r committed to take minimum 8 to 9 hours for treatment. Keep it up.",1
"Staff on Safire ward(psychiatric unit) have been superb!!
From the care assistants to the junior doctors
Everyone who has looked after my cousin has been kind professional and knowledgable

"A&E waiting time is too long, There is not enough seats for patients in waiting area and no cleaning at all. Mess on the floor. Service are very poor.",1
"I came to the hospital pregnant, with a sharp pain in the stomach, crying because of the pain, I have been waiting for the doctor to see me for 5 hours.  and still no one has even accepted me.  even if you die right in them on a chair, no one will notice",1
You should wait for the doctor 6 hours for example am I dying in this  six hours who’s gonna be responsible   It’s like  joke in this hospital  i’ve been there for six hours and then one of the nurse came in to me and said to me why you came here for hahahah,1

I will be eternally grateful to them for the care in which I received in Critical Care, Mark Longshaw & staff are so commited & dedicated in their work. Zoe has helped in diagnosing & treating my lung condition. Sarah Coy who works in physio B is such a kind helpful lady. Would be lost without them. We are so lucky to have such amazing Respiratory Department.",5
"Though the buildings are an intimidating Victorian ex-asylum, the medical staff are wonderful and thrive despite challenging circumstances of health policy, changing management, and limitations to modernisation of environment. They have a particularly good childrens and physio provision.",5
"Appalling staff rude and unhelpful. They dont read patients notes or follow through. Left hand and right hand not knowing. Would avoid dreadful hospital. Run it for their convience dont mind keeping you waiting, appointments made which arw pointless. Arrogant consultants who seem clueless.",1
"Children's ward staff are Excellent, as are most of the staff in A&E, however it depends on what night you go. Some of the staff are very rude and their communication skills are lacking.",3
"Never doing their job on time , always busy , when u go for an appointment u should wait for hours to see a doctor or nurse.
They told us your appointment is on 8:30 but the reception was even didn't came untill 9.

The worst hospital in Manchester. I came with 40 degrees tempreture and they told me to wait 4 hours. I went in Salford Royal hospital where the doctors reacted straight away and the first 5 minutes they took care of me.,1

"This place is rubbish nothing but a building site problem's parking, things do not run to time, they send you an appointment date and time and when you arrive they have changed your appointment time,but did not inform you in advance.",2

What a horrible place and so depressing  iwas told to be there between 8 and 9 o'clock for a scan so I set out from Oldham at 6 to be on time and when I got there I had to do a urine sample and have blood taken and was told to wait in the waiting room for the doctor who was in surgery thay said it would be 1hr before he is finished  but  after waiting 1hr 30 minutes I said when is the doctor coming to do my scan and thay said it could take several hours so I just discharged myself and thay didn't even offer us a cup of tea or a sandwich,1

I do not recommend this hospital for emergency because I went by mistake it took me like 7 or 8 hours,1
Avoid!! Staff extremely slow and unhelpful. Dont wate your time. Average time to be seen is about 6 hours and they constantly lie to you that you are next.,1

"My wife had her induction here at this hospital previously was referred by a doctor at saint Mary’s hospital, however the induction shouldn’t have been the first option as her sugars were controlled. We went for our induction at north Manchester antenatal ward and we were both stunned with the level of professionalism and support we received from the entire team . My wife had a complicated labour and the team acted quickly, they reminded me of the film infinity stone from the marvels  on her Labour Day they took us from a small room to the theatre where they operated and that’s where the magic happened!! I probably won’t see these hero’s again but words cannot describe how thankful I am to the whole team absolutely incredible great and outgoing people who really care and take full pride in doing their job.
At one point my wife had a panic attack and there was a trainee midwife that had somehow managed to calm her down after me failing to have any effect on her breathing. Their labour team is highly trained even the lowest levels are extremely intelligent on another level.

I don’t understand how some reviews on here talk about racism, I found that to be the opposite and the entire team was multi-cultured and all worked as one👏👏👏👏👏

#NHS thank you 🙏",5
"I was attacked by hospital security after Police entered my home for no apparent reason. Mental Healthy Service then have it all covered. I have a little girl, all suffer and depression. He was petrified and excruciating. This has happened on numerous occasions and is strange. They told me what they do staff and service goes. Problem. Shocking. Happened to me around 2010, 2017.",2

"I have been going to Good Hope since August last year, several visits after a routine colonoscopy that revealed a cancerous polyp.
The staff have been absolutely amazing, appointments have been made very quickly and always on time.
I am claustrophobic and the MRI terrifies me, but with the help of staff I have managed to do my first 2 successfully and I am 💯 sure they will get me through the next year having another every 3 months.
I cannot recommend this hospital more highly, they are fabulous and I am extremely grateful for the care they give.",5
"We found ourselves in good hope A&E last night. From start to finish all of the staff we encountered were just lovely. We were in, treated and out within 4 hours. I had my assistance dog with me, and they were so accommodating; she was able to be with me in the treatment rooms and everyone was so sweet with her, but they also respected that she was working. They made a very stressful experience as painless as it could've been, and we can't thank them enough.",5
My gf and me arrive to hospital at 10:30pm she just got pain chest and nurse been take a blood test then ECG then go back waiting area any can see to clear nurse the sit on chair look a mobile nothing do sort out with my gf she said feel tried & can’t drink & eat by nurse DO NOTHING WITH MY GF WAS TREATMENT! And I hope anyone will see this like NURSE SHOULD HAVE JOBS! But I hope nurse go read to here what they is done ingore to us a keep waiting too long then we just choice go home 1:30am bec they was nothing auto said to my gf… I hope nurse have wake up bec NHS IS NOT ENOUGH IS TRETMENT TO PATIENT WHAT SHAMED!,1
"Went to A&E with bleeding and abdominal cramps.Was sent over to maternity where spoken to 2nurses describing my symptoms and telling them I think I'm having a miscarriage
Was sent home by the nurse,who did not do any ultrasound or any kind of checks on me, with ”take a paracetamol ”slogan.
Was terrified as never had a miscarriage before.
Nevertheless to say I had a miscarriage on the day and had to book a private scan in Coventry to confirm what I was suspecting.
The care I received was none existent,the way was spoken to was degrading and the nurse who sent me home with ""take a paracetamol""slogan hope will have a just as nice experience when she will need it as I had!
Because karma my friend always comes to get you!
The nurses working on maternity are lazy to their core and forget why they getting payed for.",1
"Very bad experience with the antenatal appointments. The receptionists pretend to be busy all the time, with no willingness to help.
Advises:
Be on time for your appointments!
no excuses are accepted only if you die, possibly they will take after your slot, no compassion even it's a maternity department and they work with pregnant women.

Do not drive!
Visitor car park is full with staff’s cars, don’t get stress on your head looking for a place- it’s full all the time, unless you arrive an hour early for your appointment!

If you have options to choose another hospital, do it.",1
I found staff to be very professional and helpful. They were all great communicators and answered any questions. The hospital was clean and I was looked after with a great level of care. Overall a wonderful experience,5
"Had to bring my son here Boxing day with suspected testicular torsion the staff were absolutely fantastic!!! Reception, nurses, HCAs the consultants and surgical team, absolutely amazing 👏  I had to return again this weekend but again the staff were absolutely brilliant, fantastic, my son is Autistic and he was terribly worried 😟 anxious, everyone treated him like gold. Thankyou Good Hope",5
"My husband was taken into A&E due to heart attack. Staff there were amazing. They acted fast, very courteous and friendly as well as being very professional. Excellent service, can't fault them",5
"One of the worst hospitals I’ve ever been to.  Normally I would Avoid going to hospital at all costs if Im ever ill.  I don’t like the fuss and most of the time I can treat myself with natural remedies. Not to blame all doctors for a few, but any time I’ve been sent to that hospital, I find the doctors not doing their full due-diligence. Mis diagnosis is actually pretty common in healthcare, but when your doctor disregards your symptoms to get you out of the hospital ASAP, that’s pretty negligent. My last visit to Good Hope I waited for about 3 hours before I saw a doctor. When I eventually saw one I gave them all the details of my symptoms. Which was numbness starting from my toes and slowly making its way up over my lower half, every day. I also had shooting pains on my spine. Which wasn’t going away with normal pain killers. The doctor gave me a blood test and then just vaguely gave me a diagnosis of a low vitamin D deficiency, because apparently a lot of black people had that, and I’m black so that was the explanation they could come up with. Needless to say the symptoms only got worse days after my visit and I was in even more pain. Asked my local GP for advice, she told me to not go to Good Hope especially if I was suffering from neurological issues. Went to a different hospital was given an MRI, lumbar puncture and then sent home after a week with no clear diagnosis. Decided to go private because this was my body and I was sick of the laziness from our precious NHS. I was eventually diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis and I had a freaking tumour the size of a cantaloupe in my lower abdomen. I don’t expect nurses or Doctors to know everything but I do expect to be given a clear and thorough examination. Which they did not do. The only 2 words I would use to describe this hospital is Laziness and incompetence.  I’m pretty lucky that I could go private at the time, I couldn’t imagine where I would be if I hadn’t. The fact that people call this hospital No Hope is pretty telling and accurate.",1
"I went to the A&E department last night and it’s the best one I’ve ever been to. They had staff on sight checking vitals. I was seen within 30 minutes of arriving (seems cheeky but I couldn’t breathe😭) they were so so lovely and helpful. Very thorough. Took bloods, did an x ray, even gave me my prescription whereas normally you’re left to get it on your own. they were 100% overworked and probably understaffed but every single person, even the porters had a smile on their faces and couldn’t do enough to help. I honestly cannot sing their praises highly enough. Thank you to them for helping me in such a scary situation😊💕",5
"Came in with my partner for a booked scan, they where fab very polite and helpful. We were sent 2 two different departments to get the results the last was A and E, this is where it all went downhill. Had to book in just to get the results and even have obs taken. Staff were as friendly and helpful as wet fish, and the security guys were more sympathetic to the people we seen coming in. Many staff seen on their phones standing around laughing. The Docters where good and very helpful when we seen them for less than 5 minets. Unbelievable",2
"I recently went to visit my Nan in this hospital where she has been staying on the geriatric ward (ward 9), I am absolutely disgusted in the way my Nan has been left in her bed numerous times, and the way she and others in this ward have been treated! My Nans dignity and respect have not been maintained at all it’s disgusting how these professionals can even call themselves professionals, there was a point when a nurse had came in and a woman in the other bed had a type of dementia and was talking to herself and was calling out in pain, this nurse then found it appropriate to mimic this elderly woman and tell her to “shut up”, my Nan had been left in her own faeces and was cleaned when another one of my family members had told them that this was no way acceptable. There was another incident when another woman had come to visit her mother in the hospital and asked another nurse if she could take her mother for a walk in the wheelchair she had brought with her, the nurse had gave her the green light to do so, after an hour or so the nurse who was supposedly looking after the elderly on this ward did not know where she had gone and was looking in the toilets for her she then turned to me and I said “I hope she’s not on the floor because I’d be in trouble”,  it took for her to ask me where this patient had gone for her to know she was on a walk with her daughter! There is absolutely no communication skills for these staff that call themselves professionals. My Nan had became extremely ill through having a knee operation that was later on to be realised she should not of had the operation again due to the lack of communication skills this has come to my Nan becoming extremely ill and now being sent home due to the hospital not being able to do anything for her! I hope this review is able to become an understanding for these “professionals” to change how they are delivering care to individuals and make their quality of care improve.",1
"We're from burton on trent, but my mum ended up at good hope. All staff were very caring towards her and us. They treated her with dignity. All staff at burton should go and spend time there to see how it's done properly",5
"Was in a&e the other day and got told to go back if issues and pain continued, so I did only to be turned away when I got there and told apparently a doctor said they won’t see me and I have to go back to my GP. Didn’t realise the NHS can now turn away patients. Good hope… more like NO hope.",1
"I am still at A&E, I’m waiting almost 3 hours to be seen... I was in a lot of pain and I tried to explain it to them exactly 5 times. They just said it was normal and always encouraged me to give up... every time they said that if I wanted to give up it was my choice... at no point did I talk about giving up waiting, but both at reception and the nurses said that if I wanted I could give up.",1
"I would like to say a big thank you to all team ( from nurse to doctors)AE Emergency Department.
I'm still here but the kindness and the care are providing here ,made me to feel safe and less worried about my illness.
We need more people like this !!!!
Thank you!",5
"I think it is a joke that this hospital still has a one parent policy in place within the Childrens Ward, as an NHS Trust you should be aware that children respond to there parents in different ways and having both in attendance is more beneficial for the wellbeing of the patient than only one. This practise was acceptable during the initial Covid-19 outbreaks but not now! both parents have rights!! Especially when my child had to be held down to have an inhalor.",1
"Given how much pressure the NHS staff are under, they were so caring and did an amazing job. I took off a star because I was waiting in an ambulance for 4 hours but given the strikes I don’t think it can be massively helped",4
Just wanted to say the ladies in the Gyno area E of this hospital have been amazing and lovely each time I’ve been. Always super helpful and attentive making sure you’re comfortable. Thank you!,5
"I went to A and E on Sunday 10th of October 2023. I had been having serious pain in my left kidney area  for 4hrs and it had become unbearable. I booked in and sat in waiting area. By this time it was 9pm .After 2 hrs I was told I was in the wrong waiting area and told to go upstairs to the first floor. I booked in there and sat in waiting room. It was 11pm by then and I was very tired , tried to stay awake but couldn’t and I almost fell of my chair. A nurse finally came and I was assessed and they said I needed a scan . I was at last given some pain relief at this time. I told the nurse I hadn’t eaten for 12hrs and she kindly made me a cup of tea and some brown toast.  Not long later she took me for my scan and then took me back to the downstairs waiting area. Here I sat for another 5hrs. I was told the scan showed I had a kidney stone with some swelling and they wanted to send me to Heartlands hospital for treatment .I was in more pain so I was given medication for that.I was very very tired as I had been awake for more than 24hrs by then, I got very stressed and tearful and asked if I could go home to sleep. They said if I left I would loose my place. It was 5.30 am Monday morning by then and I was very stressed  and tearfull. I made the decision to go home to get some sleep. I slept for 7hrs straight and felt so much better for it. Now I am usually a very patient person and fully understand that the NHS is under funded and understaffed but too expect a 73 yr old to stay awake for 24hrs plus is unreasonable and cruel. I still have the kidney stone and am controlling the pain as best I can. The NHS is truly broken.",1
"Attended A & E tonight with my daughter who got an earring stuck in her earlobe. They literally got her in and out in less than 10 minutes. Quickest hospital visit in my life! And she’s not traumatised thank god 😂
Thankyou!",5
I spoke to staff nurse Thunali and they blamed my past mental health issues for asking for a physical health scan because i believe my genetics have been tampered with. I don't feel right and they are neglecting me and blaming mental health. My human rights are being abused and breeched and i am in danger of losing everything I've lived for because of neglect by the NHS. Staff nurse Maude then proceeded to take my bloods and then they discharged me. They took about 5/6 hours to get it iver and done with.,1
"Visited Good Hope today 14 th November for a chest XRay,
Helpful happy receptionist guided me area F another very happy receptionist.
Greeted by radiographer , again happy friendly professional I was back in my car in 20 mins free parking as under 30 mins.
Wanted to comment as our NHS gets such bad press.
Thank you for excellent treatment.",5
"Had Gyno procedure on Tuesday 21st November and from the Aneathist, Nurses on Day Surgery and Recovery Ward Nurse all were very efficient and friendly including DrDr Khadjia",5
"Trying to find out about my 99 year old sister who last I heard was in an ambulance outside hospital for 5 hours. Even though I provided full name and her birthday because I couldn’t give year of birth  told me they could give no information. She is alone and I find this disgusting,",1
"This place is absolutely a joke. The so called staff do not know what they are doing, we have been waiting needlessly for 8 hours and no one has come to see us. People have come after us, they have been seen and let out, we are yet to be seen. Most of the staff either do not know what they are doing or are not doing what they are paid to do. The clowns who are monitoring the function of these services should be sacked as they are too impotent to tell the difference between a service and just having a laugh.",1
"I got there about 0900 car park was almost full which surprised me, first 30 minutes are free which was great for me as I was in had my appointment and returned to the pay machine in less than half hour. Nice hospital friendly and helpful staff.",5
"A very nice hospital. There's so many signs and very clear to navigate around.

They charge about £3.10 for two hours which isn't too bad. I thinks that's the price in all NHS hospitals in Birmingham.

They're very strict to the covid guidelines and have facemasks etc in place if required.",5
I came in today for a day stay procedure under General…& I have to say I was so well looked after by ALL the nurses doctors and staff who were so kind and caring.Thank you so much for making a nervous patient’s stay a pleasant one!,5
I would like to say how well I was looked after  by this hospital  and staff I went into hospital  Friday  and came  out Sunday  I had chest pain. Fortunately it wasn't a heart attack. They deserve  the best feedback,5
"Went to A&E for my children. Receptionist/ Nurses were extremely rude. Shouting at parents when going through a difficult time. More so to the people of colour too. Sickening. Staff also lying to each other so they didn't get the blame but instead blame parents for 'not listening' when they were questioned by other staff that clearly looked intimidating to them. Staff knew they were giving incorrect information to parents, e.g Telling parents to go to the waiting area, once there, the parents were being shouted at and blamed for 'not doing as they've been asked on arrival and to go back to the receptionist'. This place was unreal. The way people in general were being treated by the condencending staff was beyond disgusting! Waiting times seem to increase as soon as you've waited the HOURS you've originally been told to wait. 6 hours went by then an announcement of a further 3 hours and so on. They could have a system in place but no they expect SEN children with extermely high fevers, in pain to sit around for 12 hours plus. No wonder why they're actually known as NO HOPE HOSPITAL! NHS staff at other hosiptals have told me this themselves!",1
Saved my partners life twice.  Excellent hospital.  Staff are angels literally.  I can never thank you enough,5
"Waiting times is absolutely tremendous can’t really blame staff for it as they was doing their best, but we had to wait for over 10 hours so far , I’m leaving this review while we still wait and hope that we will be sorted soon but hopes are fading just like patients who have to wait so long",1
"We visited this Unit Harvey Ward as we’ve been referred by our Gp and whilst talking to the Doctor about concerns as it’s our second time coming for same problem about our child. The HCA staffs and a midwife were busy laughing at us.

The lack of professionalism is so alarming!

It’s our child and we have every right to be
emotional, and lay all complains possible to the Doctor to understand, so we don’t keep coming back. These staffs were laughing and making jest behind me and I can hear them loud and clear. Lazing around and doing nothing, the last time I check the hospital is not a comedy font.

The first test we had came back as error because as one of them made a mistake hence why we came back again.  Am not the only parent they did this ‘laughing jest’ thing too that day as I saw them doing same to other parents. Pls do better!

Am not sorry I love my child so much to be very concern about her well-being.

And we want to thank the A&E children Units. For making us feel welcome. Their staffs their are amazing.",1
Beware. Watch your vulnerable family members. Especially on ward 15 at night. One Person is a known bully to the vulnerable. When reported to day staff they knew who we meant. Why are male junuor staff allowed to take ladies to toilet and shout at them. This needs investigating.,1
High level of racism. White folks get seen immediately even though they came after you. And leaves before you. Your symptoms gets worsen while you are there. You get to sit more than 5 hours.,1
"Went in with severe chest pains struggling with deep breaths, I have history of pneumonia yet the doctor examined told me I'm fine offered no x ray an told me to leave, at which point expressed my concern that I think I need an x ray as when I last was diagnosed it took me 3 doctors assessing me before going for an x ray to find out I had pneumonia, however when expressing the concern and asking to talk to a senior member of staff, I spoke to the senior on the ward who told me to go back to waiting room or she would call security, when I asked her name as I wanted to make a complaint with how she dealt with me she then ran off and hid her id in her desk, i asked her why she did this she said she hasn't got to tell me and again threatened me with security because i was stood in the corridor talking to her, i also felt uncomfortable in the waiting area as it was very full and i felt like i needed some air as i was struggling with chest pains, this was completely disregarded, she then called security and I was watched throughout all my assessments by security then, even when lifting my shirt up, i found this a violation of my privacy, i felt uncomfortable expressing this at the time due to having 2 security staff in full uniform in the area, I felt outnumbered and singled out, and then to be told i have nothing wrong its possibly bruising from a fall 2 weeks ago, i found i had to accepted this diagnoses and was still then escorted out the hospital by the 2 security staff  it was as though as soon as i mentioned a complaint I was treated like a criminal, this hospital really needs to check the ways they treat their patients",1
"I wish I could give 0 stars. This place is an absolute joke. I came to the A&E at 9pm, I waited 7 hours to see the doctor and at the end the nurse told me I still have to wait a couple more hours thus I decided to leave. The staff are absolutely horrible, the nurses I had contact with all lacked any empathy and replied as if I owed them a fortune. It’s clearly visible that all the staff that came from abroad are doing this for the money, Absolute no care for patients that were sick, utterly rude and not fit to work for the NHS.
Good Hope Hospital must be the worst hospital in the country by a mile and the name of the hospital must be the second biggest joke after the under educated staff.",1
I have been to this fantastic hospital today and the checkups they provided for me was perfect and the doctors and the nurses are so friendly and helpful. I have never new a hospital like goodbope  exist as my past experience with the other hospitals in Birmingham was worse.,5
"Would rate zero stars if I could. Absolutely awful hospital with no compassion or regards to their patients. The healthcare assistants do more than the actual nurses. Some staff really go all out and over work themselves , unfortunately not all staff are so passionate about their jobs, hence why some staff have to overwork themselves. Total lack of communication and seem to be a very disorganised place. Should be renamed No Hope Hospital.",1
"Having just had to drop my wife at the hospital I was amazed at the speeding, by people who are obviously staff from the hospital. The speed limit signs around the hospital state 10 mph. If your own staff can't obey the rules, why should anyone else?",1
"Today my 4yr granddaughter was taken into AE . I cannot praise the staff enough, from the initial nurse, reception staff in both AE, and children department  to nurses and GP doctor within the hospital.
Thank you to our NHS",5
"The staff at the children's A&E needs training on empathy. Just a bunch of emotionless people. I get it, you all see really gruesome stuff sometimes but be kind when a worried mother approaches you even if you think it is minor.

I called 111 for my son who woke up with a really bad nose bleed. I was asked to go to good hope by the call handler.

When I got to good hope, The nurse said there was no Dr in the hospital to see my son and sent me to warren farm to see a Doctor claiming they had made an appointment. Gave me a bogus reference number only to be told by warren farm that there was no appointment on their systems and they are run by nurses with no Doctors available.",1
"I was rushed into Good Hope resuscitation unit and was cared for by the critical care team. I ended up staying in hospital for 12 days and although being a patient in hospital is not very nice, the nursing & HCA staff were just so unbelievably kind & caring. I would highly recommend this hospital if you need good quality care & understanding 👍🏻",5
"Had to go to Minor Injuries Sunday afternoon as I’d twisted my knee. From start to finish I was met with polite, friendly staff. From registration, to x ray, to being reviewed, fitted with crutches and discharged with advice took just 3hrs. Well done to the whole team.",5
"The hospital is okay, not great but what really deducts the stars is the parking or lack thereof. It's so bad people just park wherever they can to make it all work.

At least it's so bad that if you do get a park in carpark A, the barrier is broken, so at least you don't have to pay for the frustration of having to drive around it going someone leaves.",3
Waited for permission to leave rather longer than expected but staff were very friendly and helpful and I felt very grateful for their kind attention.,4
"Fantastic care from a amd e staff, surgical team and the staff in ward 2. Made my stay very comfortable. Thank you",5
"First shift bad attitude and didn't want to listen even with doctors letter and advice and orthopaedic specialist recommendations, 7pm start shift much more helpful and said we need to go to TOA not wait in A&E  needless waiting just because of 1 women's not helpful and bad attitude 😡😡😡😡",1
"I would like to say a huge thank you to Good Hope hospital. A and E and short stay ward. Especially to Anita, Sanja and Christian (Philippine nurse). The whole experience was amazing. From the time I was admitted to the time I was discharged I was supported. Even the food was good. Clean and tidy and nothing too much trouble. Thank you again.",5
Had reason to accompany dementia patient at Good Hope twice within 3 days. Staff in A & E and Neurology were excellent. All very pleasant and extremely helpful. Only downside was the wait in A & E to see a doctor. All working very hard though.,4
Very dangerous hosptial  and extremely dangerous  security   staff including extremely inexperienced staff nurses doctors  site managers dealing with very  vulerable patients   extremely hostile place also other patients who are not vulerable  put other vulnerable patient's  at massive risk,1
"Visited the hospital which is local to me at 1am Sunday morning. My 16 yr old daughter was very unwell at the time. Since arrival we were treated with nothing but care and professionalism. All staff were amazing, polite and informative. We visited minors in A&E, CDU and then SAU and all areas were lovely, not only with my daughter but to me also. I am a nurse myself but it gave gave ne great reassurance thst during the difficult time in the NHS at present, the compassion is still very much there. A special thanks to Sister Toni on SAU who reassured me when my daughter went quite poorly at one point. Keep up the good work! :)",5
"Absolutely disgusting  service in good hope hospital  antenatal ward . I went to have my scan and before even walking into the scan room . I was waiting by the desk while the woman Louise just stared at her computer screen totally blanking me for 5 minutes until I asked how long I’ll be waiting . I was then taken into the room to find  a male sonographer. I politely requested for a female and I was told I would have to rebook which I had no problem doing . I was then weirdly looked at and spoken to at the desk just  because I’ve asked for to be booked by a female  . Service was absolutely appalling . Really cannot believe how both the women were speaking at the desk as well as the male sonographer . Definitely will be going back to solihull for my scans . Although it’s so far away, definitely worth it .",1
I unfortunately chose this hospital for my maternity care and birth. I have had a terrible experience and if I choose to have another child I would rather travel a large distance than to give birth here again.,1
Good Hope a.k.a NO HOPE HOSPITAL😡😵‍💫 I've been at this hospital twice with concerning hernia issues with my infant son and twice I've had to walk out and go to a different hospital because of the lack of Carr and empathy and the Nurses on the children's ward are clearly just working for the pay and not the passion to care for children. I went to Birmingham Childrens Hospital and was seen to in like 2hrs. I was waiting nearly 3hrs at No Hope with a distressed crying 3month old and no1 even checked to ask what's wrong with him. I just hope that no child DIES on the really lack of interest watch.,1
Absolutely first class care this morning. Went in today with chest pains from the ambulance service to the doctors and nurses I could not fault them. A huge thanks 👍,5
Very bad experience at there.. never gonna go there ever.. they took my sister near to death because of their own big mistake. She still suffering because of their foolishness. Very very disappointed with them. Will never recommend to anyone especially for maternity.,1
"Recently had an Angiagram, all I can say is absolutely 💯
Very personal, and tea and biscuits to follow.
Massive thanks to NHS.
Now off Coventry to get sorted 👌",5
"My mom had to have some tests,the nurses were very attentive and helpfull, mom was scared but they soon put her at ease and thankfully we had good results. Thank you to all the nurses for being so lovely",5
"Extremely helpful nurses and friendly staff. I and my wife spent 2 nights at the fothergill block and been treated with care, respect and dignity.  All the staff are amazing",5
"I am exceedingly disappointed with their lack of communication skills. A few months ago I had a telephone appointment booked for 11am, I had a telephone interview set for mid-day from Canada and the call from Good Hope never came, I had to put that interview off and I ended up losing the job to someone else and the most likely culprit being the fact my call from Good Hope never came. I waited for four hours. I have another telephone appointment booked today, for 11am and it is now after mid-day, I am appalled and there will be repercussions from this.

I am exceedingly disappointed as it seems Good Hope does not realize that we have LIVES!!!!!",2
"I was admitted to A&E on the morning of 11th May and was looked after very well
I then ended up in the Medical Assessment Unit until being discharged 4 days later the treatment was second to none and all the doctors, registrars consultants and Nurses and the staff who bought the food to me were wonderful",5
"Awesome hospital, I've never had a bad experience here. The staff are kind and very helpful.
Just a pity they spent so short staffed.",5
"I don't leave reviews often so this means something.
I've never experienced kindness, good bedside manners or a correct diagnosis from any hospital in Birmingham or abroad before, until I came to Good Hope. Naturally, because of this I tend to suffer from great anxiety whenever I step foot in a hospital due to how poorly I have been treated by medical professionals my whole life.
I was waiting to have a scan and I knew I was feeling overwhelmed and couldn't stop crying. The ladies in the reception area F of the treatment centre were wonderful. They came round and talked me out of my panic attack, comforted me and took time out of their day to make me a coffee and give me compassion. I have never had that before in a hospital and it goes a long way. In other hospitals in Birmingham, I have been mocked for my anxiety, overlooked, called stupid when I refused my diagnosis of 'bad period pain' to find out 9 months later I had in fact endometriosis all along. I've had my shirt thrown in my face when I expressed concern about cancer lumps so to experience such kindness was a great surprise. I can't confirm their names as the rules state this review might be taken down if I do and I do not want that to happen. Everyone needs to know how wonderful Area F reception were. I hope the CEO will take note of the importance of people like them and what a difference that makes to the mental health of patients. It is vital! Band 2's and 3's are just as important to the team as Band 7's and 8's. I hope the ladies who helped me yesterday, get to see this review and know that they did a great job and I am very grateful. I needed a friendly face at the time so thank you! Thank you very much.",5
Hospital staff don’t deserve 1 start they don’t care about you if  you suffering from pain. If you ask for painkillers  you will get it after 4 hour take me 8 hour to see doctor.,1
"I have been to the Same Day Medical Emergency Unit for the last 3 weeks.The staff were always extremely busy, but still had time to smile & be exceptionally kind & caring. A special thank you to Consulants
Natalie& Jenny. Also Xray department& the kindness experience by the radiologist having my scan. Everyone works extremely hard & a huge thankyou to everyone.",5
"I would rate my experience at GOOD HOPE A&E as excellent, and the speedy service I received was second to none. From the lovely triage nurse as you walk into A&E, to my fantastic nurse Wendy (with the chakra tattoos) and the wonderful consultant.  I was in and out within about 2 hours. My best experience ever.  Now if GP receptionists could take a leaf out of the 'real professionals' book, the NHS would be running as beautiful as ever.  I 💙 our NHS.  Get rid of all the useless middle management and pay the people on the FRONTLINE what they deserve and much more 🤩",5
Having heard mixed experiences I was not sure what to expect. I can honestly say for what was a bit of a worrying visit to the Treatment Centre I had the best experience from the 2 nurses and surgeon that sorted my treatment and the lady at the ticket portacabin. Just lovely postive NHS staff who put me at ease and all had a smile on their face. Thank You,5
"Fantastic care and treatment at the breast clinic today. Mrs Howie the nurse was great as was the consultant. No long waits having seen the consultant twice and had an ultrasound and mammogram and left feeling totally reassured.
Can't fault the service I received today.",5
"After having a terrible experience at this hospital when my mom died 23 years ago I have avoided the place at all costs. I visited A&E last week on 15.06.2022 and the Nurses and care staff were absolutely wonderful and so understanding. The Doctor Melvin was the most caring and professional Doctor I have ever met and I felt so reasured and well cared for, this has changed my view of the hospital and I feel the staff are amazing.",5
"Fighting a serious cancer I am due a operation in a few day,  but suffering sudden chronic back pain I went to Good Hope just for peace of mind that it wasn't anything that could jeopardise my op.
From the A&E nurse to all the staff on MAU I was treated in a professional manner by staff who were very caring and kind.  This was right down from the doctors, nurses to the health care assistants.  And also the two lovely happy people who gave me my scan.
Thank you all so much you really are appreciated.",5
My partner's old mother has been admitted 4 times to good hope hospital and each time has come out in a far worse state than when she went in. The night shifts in general couldn't care less. Wrong medication mixed with apathy seem to be the order of the day. If my voice was just a one off then fair enough but a close friend blames that hospital for the death of her father -,1
Was really looked after by everyone at the a&e department and a special mention to surgical nurse practitioner in Minor injuires she was fantastic and put me at complete ease and was a credit to the hospital. I can't remember her name but if someone could reply to this review I would like to get the lovely lady some flowers.,5
"A team from a&e together with intensive care doctors and nurses saved my partner’s life on Sunday. Thank you for your skill, dedication and professionalism and for the compassion shown to family members by a&e staff while we were waiting to see what the outcome of the medical emergency would be. I wish more people could understand what is going on behind the scenes when they may have to wait longer than they would like because staff are working hard to save lives in real medical emergencies. I am so grateful to you all",5
"I went to the hospital after losing hearing, loss of balance and blurred vision. Only to be told I had fluid in the ear. To go home and take Sudafed. Went back to my doctor's who told me to go to another hospital a couple of weeks later. After a quick CT scan I was told I had a tumor. If he didn't know why wasn't it escalated, could cost me my life",1
"My dad was taken to Good Hope since the usual stop at Heartlands was full. I phoned about four hours after he was taken to the hospital to be told he was still in A&E which wasn't exactly a shock with how things are currently. I phoned again around four hours after that, this is when I was passed around three different people to discover he was on ward 17. I was put through to the ward but it rang out for a few minutes then cut off. I've phoned 6 times since then and still nobody has bothered to answer the phone.

It's been 12 hours and we still have no idea what's going on with my dad even after 8 phone calls.",1
"Non of us like going to a hospital, but they were all very kind and caring made a stressful experience so much less stressful, thanks to all the staff",5
"My 85 old mother is No Hope Hospital.  Her care has been dismal.  She is a ward that has been shut for 8 days now but they still don't answer their phones .I have now tried today 17 times . Communication is shocking.  She was allowed to go for an x ray but they refused point blank to let her see her daughter who flew over from Spain to see her. Who knows if she will ever see her daughter again.Callous  and uncaring. .She was also told just to wet herself rather than be helped to get out of bed to go to the toiletHiw humiliating.. I am absolutely horrified and disgusted with this hospital.
If  I could have rated no stars I would have",1
"I had been assessed by the RAID team when I was in a mental health crisis. I waited 12 hours, then saw a horrible male psychiatric  nurse who told me to just go home & stop wasting his time, since he believed I was attention seeking. Needless to say, I would never recommend this hospital to anyone suffering from mental ill health. I have since been diagnosed with PTSD. The people who work in the RAID team seem to believe this condition doesn't exist, which concerns me greatly.  I will never forget how badly I was treated here. Shame on RAID, it is not fit for purpose.",1
"i spent 8 weeks at good hope, initially on AMU but was transferred to a gastro ward. there were a few staff on both wards who went out of their way to help me and talk to me however i also met staff who didn't appear to care. i also had an operation here last year and the staff treated me well before and afterwards on the surgical unit. overall not the greatest experiences but i am grateful for the staff who were lovely towards me.",3
"I would just like to thank the staff in children's A&E and CAU for all their dedication and hard work. The care, professionalism and patience was excellent. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making Jacob feel at ease and comfortable whilst in your care. Keep up all the hard work from one NHS colleague to another, your all doing a fantastic job 💙🤍",5
This place is an insult to the NHS. Bloody disgusting service all round. What A and E department doesn't have a doctor on duty. Is it because they've all been shipped over to the hospitals on the fly on the wall tv documentaries.,1
"Went in through A&E, seen in about 4 hours, then moved up to a ward for a few days for treatment.

Every member of staff I saw were amazing. The hospital was clean, and the staff were kind, experienced and helpful.

Couldn't say a bad thing about this hospital or my care here.

They are probably a little understaffed, but with Covid it's understandable and the same in every hospital across the country. And, despite this, the quality of care I received was absolutely impeccable which is something that I find very impressive.",5
"My Father was in this establishment, I was aware that he had a relapse I was allowed to see him in resus even though I had tested positive  for covid. I then kept  away from seeing him. I rang every day and on the forth day I was told oh he is fine. The next thing knew on the Monday at 6am I had a phone call from my brother to say Dad had d  died  during the night  I was his  next of kin but this hospital  to let me know he was dieing",1
"I visited the SDEC unit of good hope hospital, referred by my GP. I must say I had a great experience with the doctors and staff on duty today.

From the attention and care given to both old and young patients, to the sandwich served with hot coffee.
As much as I do not love to visit the hospital, I'm totally impressed.

God bless the health workers!",3
"Following an accident at home, I was brought in by ambulance, recently and had an overnight stay here. Everyone was so friendly and considerate ,  the ambulance crew and all the staff who took very good care of me during my short visit! Of course, I would rather have not been in hospital during the Pandemic, but even so I felt really well looked after by all the staff in A&E and the ward I stayed on overnight!
Thank you all  😊😊",5
"All i can say is RUDE & DISCRIMINATION.
I have had bad experiences a few times now, we walked in and explained my serious problem as to why we were there, the women/nurse at the line asking why were there was rude and disrespectful to me when i explained she dismissed me although the seriousness of my condition. She spoke nice and polite to the patients in-front of me but as soon as it came to me she was rude and also side eyed me. she could see my condition and still i was made to feel as if i shouldn’t be there or i was less than my gut feeling told me to just leave thats how bad she made me feel. I didn’t get to the point of booking myself in cause of how badly i was treated. another person had also witnessed the rude & dismissive way she spoke to me i honestly left upset. i was in shock with how i was spoken to. the security guard was more polite than the actual nurses. thats the truth of my experience. i came there to get help and left feeling like i had no hope of getting help from them i would rather not go again to this hospital. be prepared for rude staff and non caring staff if you do go.",1
"I was told by 111 they'd send an ambulance. I phoned them at 7pm, wasn't called back until 9.45  they said it would be after 12 before it would arrive. I said I could take him to be there quicker. It was suspected that my father had a stroke. I am still waiting in A&E, I have been here for 3 hours. Early care is essential with a stroke. I have been told it will be another 2 hours and 50 minutes. My father is 83, with dementia. He has been sitting on a hard chair in a draft, the doors are constantly opening and closing. There are others here in the same position. Disgraceful - third world countries have better care. There are approximately 15 people here at present. 3 have gone through in 3 hours  The staff here have been kind, there aren't enough of them. We have been told the wait is due to shortage of doctors and shortage of beds.",1
"Visited recently and can honestly say the experience was excellent.
Staff were very helpful and friendly",5
I was recently  admitted  to  good  hope  they have always  looked  after me thankyou to all the staff who have looked  after me over the years with my health  issues,5
"I went to good hope hospital today to get an MRI done for my heart & the MRI department were so kind &. understanding of how anxious I was about getting the medication that makes your heart beat like it would in exercise but one of the staff explained to me how it would feel which really helped to calm me down as I knew what to expect, she even stroked my arm as it went into my system, it's the littlest actions like that which show how much they care for their patients, I don't remember their names but they really made me feel better about the whole thing 💜",5
"I have recently spent 2 weeks in GH & I cannot speak highly enough of all the care I received from arrival at the assessment unit to my stay  on the cardiology ward , every member of staff , from cleaners , nurses to consultant drs treated me with the utmost respect & kindness
Thank you !",5
"My Sister was taken into good hope hospital today. I was trying to talk her through  downloading an app so she can watch TV on her phone. She is a technophobe so had no idea what to do. All of a sudden 2 lovely NHS workers took her phone, spoke to me, and sorted it all out. Now she is not just sat bored.  She is being treated so well, and feels safe and comfortable xx. Thank you Good Hope 👍🏽",5
Awful! My dad has been sitting and I mean literally sitting waiting to be seen since boxing day. My parents were sitting in assessment for 21 hours. I appreciate there's a shortage of staff but the well being of people surely isn't difficult!,1
"Ward 11 - A shocking lack of care!
My Father in Law - 83 years old was admitted with a suspected mini stroke. It turned out to be low blood pressure. My review is specifically for the shocking care he received during his time in Ward 11. He has dementia - this was not acknowledged by the ward nurse. My wife was not allowed to stay with him because she questioned the lack of care he was given (not giving his correct medicine despite being told, not checking on him, not feeding him properly, not following up tests etc).

Food was put on the table beside him and later removed uneaten. No attempt was made to ensure he ate or drank during his stay there. He lay in bed for three days and when we asked to take him home we were told he was too weak. Not surprising as he had been left to fend for himself when we were not there.
He walked with our support into the hospital and three days later (at our insistence, because we were concerned over his physical and mental deterioration), we had to push him out in a wheelchair.
He at least had his family to check on him. I despair for those older people there who have nobody to speak up for them. We witnessed poor treatment of other patients. One man said that he had learned not to complain - if he did the treatment just got worse. An absolutely shocking shambles of a ward. We will be taking this further, but I just wanted to warn people of what they or their loved ones can expect there.",1
"10 out of 10 hospital!
I came in at lunch time Saturday and I'm just waiting for my meds so I can go home now on Monday evening. I've been to hospitals all over the country, from Scotland to Cornwall and without a doubt Good Hope has some of the nicest staff I've ever met. I was in A&E, CDU and AMU and every single member of staff I met (no matter if they were porters, nurses, housekeeping, doctors etc) have been supportive and kind. They've gone out of their way at every turn to ensure I was comfortable and felt safe. One of the doctors even came with me to get a procedure done and offered to hold my hand. I cannot recommend this hospital enough!
Not only were the staff amazing but the hospital was very clean and tidy, tests were done efficiently and results came back quickly.

Carl with the porters/nurses in CDU and A&E made me laugh when I was in tears. Chloe in AMU went out of her way to make everyone feel comfortable and had a laugh doing it, all while she was working with two students.",5
"This review is for WENDY HUNT. I absolutely hate this hospital since I lost my mom here and she was treated so poorly. But I came today for surgery at the surgical assessment unit and Wendy has just made me so at ease, kept the humour going kept the doctors in order aswell 😂 Every hospital needs a Wendy 🌟. Thanks Wend! ❤️",5
"My elderly Mother was admitted in this hospital on New Years Eve 2021. she had a bad infection and was very poorly.   after A&E, she went to a ward later transferred to Gastro ward and in the end Covid ward.   Sadly she passed away 20 days later.   During her time in hospital,  all the doctors and Nurses were extremely caring towards my Mother.   they treated her so well, made her very comfortable and did their very best to help her to recover but it was not to be.  At this time visitations were not allowed but on four occasions I was allowed so she would not be so alone.   I can only offer my grateful thanks to all and appreciate everything you have done for my Mother .  You have my respect.  Thank you.",5
"Service is always amazing here, from the security guard to the paramedics, nurses and doctors, the care recieved is great. Sadly finding somewhere to park is a nightmare. This really needs to be addressed. I missed an appointment today because I couldn't park.",4
Attended here for a Colostomy yesterday. Appointment was for 13:30 I went through to treatment 10 minutes early. Everyone was so helpful and understanding of my nervousness (colonoscopy isnt a pleasant procedure). Your privacy and dignity are extremely well respected from the start and the consultant and the nursing team are superb. Post procedure you are allowed to recover with a sandwich and a cup of tea or coffee and then you sit down with a nurse who explains the after effects of the procedure clearly. They also ensure that you are going to be picked up and taken home safely by coming with you to the admission area to ensure that you are being collected and not going to slope off to the car park or public transport alone. A superb department with such caring staff. I can't fault the somewhat uncomfortable (by it's very nature) procedure,5
Being in an emergency department. Wasted my 3hrs for nothing. I was explaininin why I am concerning and instead doing some proper test he just stated all is fine....like I am telling I have got continuous headache and he is saying it is fine. Dissapoint it!!!!!,1
"My partner went to A&E and was admitted into Richard Salt Ward 12 for 10 days. The staff in the ward were very professional and compassionate. Well done to overworked, under appreciated NHS staff. Thank you ❤️❤️❤️",5
"After a trip to the new Children’s A&E department with my daughter I highly recommend to anyone with children in need of urgent care - the ward is warm, clean and very child centred. Staff were brilliant and took great care of our little one.
Thank you all!",5
"I spent 8 hours in A&E recently and though the staff were lovey I was discharged with little if any information. After speaking to my GP I realise that the discharge letter contained only the very basic facts - that I'd been given blood tests and a scan but no details regarding their results. Therefore, though we know the cause of my being admitted, future treatment etc is rather difficult to gauge.",2
"Parking is terrible, people parked everywhere, on disabled and shouldn't be, red route ect, double yellow lines not good. They need to start clapping people then they will learn.",5
"Geriatric discrimination at its worst. Do not allow your loved ones to be taken here. Informed on Thursday by Consultant that Mums operation could not be put off beyond Thursday as it would be dangerous. Buzzer for meds/bathroom etc placed beyond Mums reach. Operation promised and put off everyday subsequently. Medication given at wrong times or not at all if we don't call in excess of 20 times per day. Anti emetics requested several times not followed up unless we call as above. Complaint procedure followed no response. Days of staying on hold repeatedly requesting Doctors plan/call back ignored. Pain relief not given unless we call as above. My parents have worked for decades and paid for this care. Appalled, exhausted and desperate. Just been asked if only one of us (my sister or I) could call the ward.  How we wish??? If you were following basic protocol and we didn't have to call 40 times a day there would be no need for us to call at all. I despair",1
"Could not have looked after my 86 year old mom better, staff from cleaners to consultants and everyone in between were superb, freindly and proffessional. Big shout out to ward 29 which was also very clean.",5
"I gave birth here this month and was so happy I chose Goodhope over Burton (where I did so 6 years ago) Every member of staff who dealt with me were so lovely and professional. The wards were great, along with delivery suite. The midwife care was brilliant. I felt secure knowing me and my baby were in excellent care.",5
"I have been local to Good Hope Hospital since the end of 2018, they have been largely excellent which is why I am giving them three stars, the two stars is their lack of communication, for both in and out patients leaves little to be desired. Things need to change on that front...FAST!",3
"It was our first visit to Good Hope Hospital, after having a slightly bad experience at Heartlands hospital in 2016 at the Maternity department.

The Experience at Good Hope Hospital was excellent staff were very attentive, supportive understanding and extremely helpful. The two Midwifes Erica and Suzanne were amazing calm and collective and supported my wife through to giving birth amazingly, great asset to have in any maternity team. I am extremely grateful. I did leave a lovely box of chocolates for them hope they received them.",5
What is the point of having a switch board if no one is going to answer it. Two and a half hours I've spent so far ringing your hospital. I know your COVID message of by heart. Absolute joke of a hospital. We used to call you no hope but as you carry the name so well change your name to it. I'd of thought in 35 yrs you would of managed to improve but sadly not. The only good thing for me personally is as a cancer patient I wouldn't set foot in your hospital because I left Sutton 35 yrs ago.. I feel sorry for the people of Sutton Coldfield if this is the best they have got to deal with.,1
"My six-year-old son was sent to hospital due to COVID and breathing difficulties. Was seen once in four hours, told my wife he could go home after they write up report. 2 hours later, still waiting. Absolutely worst hospital experience, ever! I had to wait in car (despite having clinical anxiety) because they have to protect staff yet the nurse saying this didn't have mask on over her nose. Disgraceful.",1
"Absolutely ridiculous.
miscarriage and was booked for an operation to take the baby out. They didnt say it was successful or anything, 7 days passed and we discover she may have developed sepsis. She then gets taken to heartlands to find out that the baby wasn’t even taken out in the first place?! So they opened her up and did nothing it doesn’t make sense because the full thing was still in her. Absolute carelessness, nurses and doctors are ridiculous as well. Sepsis is a life threatening condition and I cannot believe how ridiculous this is! Is this what tax payers money is used for? Honestly the entire country is a shambles fix up",1
Very very friendly both nurses and doctors. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful too. They did not keep me waiting more than 10 minutes for my initial appointment. I then had to visit xray and they were extremely helpful. As I am disabled they helped me immensely with getting on and off examination couches. Even help me by carrying my handbag. They couldn't of been more friendly and helpful. The whole hospital was extremely clean. Including the toilets and changing rooms. Nice restaurant selling beautiful fresh coffee cakes etc. A little expensive but well worth the money. Large car park with disabled parking very accessible.,5
"This hospital is good but the wait to see a doctor, waiting time 5/6 Hours, not good,",5
"I am shocked and profoundly disappointed with the treatment my son in law has received at Good Hope, a misnomer if ever there was one. This is his first experience of the NHS. He has experienced a lack of basic nursing care, the arrogance of a  consultant who walked away before my son in law had finished asking him questions, unacceptable noise on the ward by staff who seem to view the ward as their stage, lack of information about his condition and treatment. I could go on. Prior to his admission to GH I only had good things to say about the NHS and I sincerely hope they are the exception and not the rule. We can’t wait to get him home.",1
"I've been to Good Hope hospital many many times over 25 years. Both as a patient and being a support to a person or persons who have been patients at the hospital. And in all that time I have never once felt the care given by all the staff being anything but caring and professional.
It has always been to a high standard. And this is from the domestic staff to all the doctors and nurses. So thank you one and all. You are all excellent!",5
"Just wanted to commend all the midwives and staff that supported me throughout my daughters birth, I felt in such safe hands the whole time and everyone was incredibly kind, helpful, informative and supportive throughout my entire journey (which was a long one!) from the maternity assessment unit to the midwife led unit to the labour ward and then the post natal ward I can’t fault anything thank you so much!",5
"I am here  on Pediatric  Emergency  with my son from 10pm , now is 02 12am.
He twisted his foot, he had x ray, and no one is here to see the results.
My son is sleeping in chair, my daughter is alone at home
Absolutely disappointed",1
Night staff at a&e minor injury needs to be FIRED. I've never come across such rude and racist staff at a hospital in my life! The looks they give you is just shocking. They don't care to the point they sent me home without even looking at me! I'm in disbelief!,1
"Had to attend A&E as requested by my doctor for a severe migraine I have had the last 2 weeks. Upon arrival the nurses and doctors really took the time to listen to my issues and arranged scans, bloods etc and really took care of me. Explaining what was happening every step of the way. It involved a stay in AMU overnight, where the staff were absolutley faultless. Our NHS and the staff are amazing! Thank you to every single person who looked after me during my stay 12th October to 13th.",5
Nursing staff are excellent but ancillary staff i.e. receptionists are generally rude. Parking is awful especially if you have a mobility problem. No thought for dropping off disabled people. Signs are confusing and letters telling you where to attend do not relate to any hospital signage. No map printed on letters to give you a clue. I really hate travelling an hour to get to this hospital that clearly should have been closed instead of many others.,2
"My wife recently spend nearly 4 weeks at Good Hope. I don't want to comment on the time it takes to provide results of blood, X-rays or MRI scans which was abysmal.  If I was the CEO i would be embarrassed by this.......could be a resourcing issue,  I do however want to comment on the staff who saw my wife and provided care. In a nutshell the staff my wife came into contact with at A&E, the Acute Wards and the Homeward Ward were excellent. They were professional, helpful , supportive and caring and I thank them on behalf of my wife.",4
"Had to visit A & E, I can't say any visit is a pleasure but the staff were great. All were friendly and efficient, kept me informed what was happening with good estimates of time frames and although I'm sure they were busy all were happy to answer questions and I never felt they were in a hurry to be elsewhere.",5
Right my mum went to good hope at 1.30pm and 2.20am in the morning shes Just got back home the waiting time is just unbelievable,1
"I have had to visit the A & E department at Good Hope twice recently. All the staff were amazing and kept me informed as to what was happening with me. The hospital was spotlessly clean and social distancing measures were being adhered to by the majority of patients., thankfully",5
"Had to go here about 2 months back. Very good reception staff. Very good triage and the doctors were excellent.
Although there was a bit of a wait. This was to do with my Doctor's referral as an emergency patient.
Just a very good professional team of dedicated staff.
They dealt with my problem perfectly.
Thank you to all concerned.
🌹🌹🌹.
As I said I saw the correct doctor last time I went to the hospital. And he just said Go home. Well I knew it would get worse it has
It will not kill me but it is uncomfortable and could have serious side effects if not put right.
🙏😓.",5
"Just spent 6 days here and was blown away with how i was treated and efficient it all was. I was in ward 18 next to the covid ward and whilst its eye opening,  it shows how hard they ALL work. There's some amazing nurses here especially Deana on nights, right down the the care and support workers to cleaners. Thank you all so much for caring for me Good Hope",5
"web site not updated since 27 March 2020 !!!!!. Spent 25 minutes holding on the phone from 15.19 hours with no answer. A & E helpfully advised ward number. But that number has a fault !!!!!. All the billions poured into this NHS, and we get 3rd world service. Front line staff are good, but the management couldn`t organize the opening of an envelope. Disgusting",1
"Writing this review on behalf of my Mom who went to A&E at Good Hope Hospital a couple of days ago and was kept overnight on the CDU unit for observations/test. Appalling neglect while there as she had to ask for tea/sandwich otherwise would have been left to starve as were the other 2 ladies who were also there. Had I not been there I would have suspected that the staff are over-worked etc, however, 3 members of staff and 3 patients to look after is hardly being rushed off your feet! Up until now I have always praised the NHS but following this experience I have realised that it's now beyond hope. The issues here aren't so much staff shortages but rather the poorly trained/supervised staff and general lack of care and dedication.",1
"I gave birth at Good Hope Hospital late October 2013 and I enjoyed the whole experience. It was quiet, everyone was helpful and kind (bar one midwife, who thankfully wasn't in with me). I had 2/3 different midwifes but they were all so lovely and made me feel really comfortable. The room was big and clean. It really made my first natural birth amazing. Thank you Good Hope! I'll be back next July to give birth again!",5
"After visiting good hope hospital in the middle of the night a few weeks ago I can't believe how I was treated. I had been suffering really bad with an abcess and having on going treatment with the dentist and I appreciate hospitals done deal with dental issues. I had been taking over the counter pain relief, the strongest I could get but I was only getting an hour relief from them. One night at 3am in the morning I woke up sweating, red hot, face and neck swollen and struggling to breath. Searching on Google it stated I should go to a&e but I first rang 111 and they immediately told me to to go a&e. I arrived and went to the the little pop up desk where a member of staff asked me a few questions before heading to reception. I explained what had happened and that 111 told me to come. He said there's nothing we can do because we don't deal with dental which I knew but with the swollen face and neck and struggling to breath I said so your going to leave me like this? He said if you can talk you are not struggling to breath and no wonder your hot with a coat and scarf on. I actually couldn't believe that he had just said this. It was snowing outside and - 4,im hardly gonna come out in a t shirt. He told me to go home and not waste their time. I demanded I saw someone as he was dressed in green and looked like cleaner if you asked me. Luckily a nurse saw how I was and took me through. Pain relief given and after a while it calmed down. Regardless of the dental issue, it was still a bad infection that was stopping me from breathing and shouldn't be left to go home. I have never felt so disgusted with a service in my life.",1
"Parking atrocious, cars parked anywhere with blue warning stickers. You need to allow an extra hour for appointments😞",3
When you have an appointment don't bother showing up for your scheduled time. Wife went for her appointment at 12:30 only to see 6 other people in the queue before her and spent over 2 hours waiting for her turn... Jokes. Yet NHS wants to charge patients for missed appointments... I would have walked out there the moment she's seen the 6 people queue....,1
"I came in for terrible stomach pains, and violent vomiting that had lasted for a few months. The medical team took me seriously, even when I was so nervous and struggled to communicate with the receptionist (first time at hospital) I had the best medical care and was given antisickness medication and other IV fluids , and I can honestly say that the first time in ages I can eat without being sick and vomiting. Thank you for the super fast test results too!",5
"NO HOPE!!!

Checked into A&E for my 2 year old son at 10:30 pm but told at 4:30am (6 hours later) that there were no doctors to see him and referral given to Badgers clinic for 10:30am on the same day.

Total 12HOURS until my son was treated.

* There were 3 patients Infront of me
* Informed of no doctors at my turn
* This is a waiting time of over *2 HOURS* per patient in a LARGE HOSPITAL!!!!.
* 4 more behind me also given referrals.

Unacceptable!!! YOUR ARE FAILING YOUR PATIENTS.",1
Came in by ambulance for suspected heart attack after experiencing severe chest pain in Tamworth. Spent three days here and had treatment and an angiogram test. Everyone was fantastic. Going back for heart MRI. Really have confidence in this hospital.,5
"I've been here over the years for everything from x-ray to emergency operations, but I never had a complaint always helpful.",5
"September 2018: Lots of room for improvement on day case unit.
No visitors rule should apply to all patients or not be enforced at all.
Little to no communication as to what was going on before it happened.
Left for hours before surgery while hungry and thirsty, I could smell toast and coffee, not professional at all.
No sympathy or consideration for a mental health issue (severe anxiety & panic attacks)
Two stars given as nurse that looked after me post surgery was lovely",2
"Good Hope Hospital saved my life and I have had 3 rounds of surgery there and spent time in ICU.  I originally attended A&E and was quickly dealt with. Staff are friendly helpful and although variability in this is down to individual staff, generally they are kind considerate and attentive. The assistants are amazing too and I cannot fault them. If less people with minor ailments and who are drunk or malingering attended A&E the lower the waiting times would be and besides serious cases always jump the queue and so they should. A&E is there to save lives not to put a sticky plaster on your graze or give you paraceptomol for your cold symptoms.",5
"Really wanted to give Good Hope the benefit of the doubt as my mum had good care there. However, she was very unwell with metastatic breast cancer and was obviously in her final days and very confused. They wanted to send her home despite the fact she was dying and we couldn’t look after her. She was due to be discharged 10 days before she passed away.

As well as this, a lot of her jewellery went missing (a wedding ring, engagement ring, bracelet and earrings) whilst she was staying there. As I said, I want to give Good Hope the benefit of the doubt but seeing other comments on here about similar cases has made me wonder if there are staff taking jewellery from sick and dying patients. PALS have been very helpful during this time and we have filed a formal complaint. I am doubtful that the jewellery will turn up; initially I was sure she had taken it off at home and misplaced but we have turned the house upside down looking for it.

So disappointed with the care my mother received in her final days. Hopefully this review, and others, will convince people to be vigilant of their loved one’s possessions if they stay here!",1
"I visited the a&e department. Within an hour was  directed towards gyne dept , staff at the reception was polite. I had to wait for wait 3 hours plus to be seen as there were not enough doctors at gyne.  Dr Pardi was working alone in gyne dept for late shift and was incredibly busy. I was looked after by Dr Pardi and nurse laura. They are very polite , efficient and helpful, Dr Pardi did promise me that she will attend to me which she did. It was a very long wait it was worth it. Dr Pardi is lovely and very helpful , need more doctors like her in NHS . :) There is  some hope for good hope.",5
"I went to an empty a&e room from being transferred from my GP, to be seen by a doctor who did not have the time of day to listen to me and was putting words into my mouth which was not at all the problem! She was rude she didn't do what i needed when the GP referred me over she just told me to go home. Absolutely disgusting!",1
People waiting for medical attention haven't been seen for over two hours. One of them is potentially having a miscarriage. Yet the medical are more concerned with dancing in wards than actually carrying out there duty. If you value your lives and your loved ones. Stay away from this place.,1
"Why do people do these jobs if that's the best they can do! The people on reception just didn't care and weren't really interested. I even watch them ignore an old man for about 3 mins whilst they finished their conversation.
I was seen very quickly for initial consultation, but was a little concerned when the nurse was writing my notes on a paper towel. Then about 10 min later I had an ecg.
I then was left in the waiting area for two hours. I then received a phone call from a nurse, whilst sat in the waiting are, asking me why I wasn't in the Majors reception. Aparently it was my fault I was sent to the wrong waiting area. The nurse was very rude and arogant, not just to me but to everyone she encountered. She may of been having a bad night but at the end of the day, why not talk to people instead of just pointing and grunting.....
I then sat in the waiting area for about another 45 min until I eventually got to talk to a consultant/doctor.
Having time to sit and watch, I watched a completely disorganised, chaotic A&E. People being wheeled in and just dumped in the middle of the room. Some quite ill looking pensioner just left there in their night gowns. It was not the number of patients or the time patients were coming in, it was clear that there was no one there to lead or guide the staff. It was just a free for all.....
Went back the following day for a prescription and it took 45 min for 3 tablets. No wonder people are miserable especially when they have sick kids, at least they have a manky wooden cube to play with.
Maybe they take their time so they make more profit on the car parking.",1
If I could give no stars I would. My father went into Good Hope Hospital 2 weeks ago. The ward he is on do not answer the phone . I have tried over 2 days over 40 calls and they have not picked the phone up. My father has dementia so is not able to call us. The use of COVID to not allow visits means there is NO communication. You can get no response and there is nothing you can do about it!! It is a lack of common decency !! An awful place and very unprofessional. The lack of communication is appalling!,1
"This is not a review of the hospital as a whole but of the A&E reception staff (not treatment reception) I encountered today.  Considering these are people you deal with at usually quite a harrowing time I have NEVER encountered such a rude, ignorant lady as I did today.  This type of person would never maintain a job outside the NHS in the private sector. As a first port of call that rude attitude would fail any business.  How do these people remain employed is beyond my realm of comprehension.  It's a shame really as all other staff were so pleasant and helpful and they are ones with all the pressure and demands!",1
They are helping me with my chronic glaucoma and they are good,5
"Hi
I just want to say, how fantastic the staff were.
From the moment I was admitted
Into A&E,to my release, the care I got was nothing short of brilliant.
The staff on ward 16 were great, nothing was too much trouble.
I ,and my family thank you all, without you, I would not be here.",5
The best hospital as I want to thank all the staff on ward 29 they are the best and better than the other hospital I go to in Lincolnshire they did amazing at least they paid more attention to me I can't thank them enough xxxx,5
"My  93 year old Mom spent the last few days of her life on ward 15. During this time she was allowed to fall out of bed during the night, goodness knows how long she was on the floor. Her diamond engagement ring disappeared. When we telephoned we were given  information relating to another patient, falsely raising our hopes and my brother was spoken to in a very rude manner when enquiring. How were so many mistakes made in such a short time?",1
"The worst children A&E I have ever seen. Nurses are arrogant and condescending. They laugh at you, making fun of you among each other whilst you are desperately concerned about your little one. They even have given false medical advice on such a serious health condition which could lead to serious consequences. They try to send you home as quickly rather than taking care of your child! I will definitely place complaint through PALS.",1
"Excellent Doctors very helpful staff, plenty of paid car park area. Restaurant is there for refreshments",5
"Disgusting hospital
No humanity
9 hours wait to see a doctor even they were not busy
Left hospital
Rude staff
No management.they should give patients time scale rather then giving us frustration saying few more hours rubbish management need to hire experienced.staff to deal with this
They should shut the hospital just wast  of time",1
"The care the staff give you is second to none, from the consultant, anesthetist, to the nurses Dr's, to the kind ladies who bring coffe and a smile. It really takes a village but u all looked after me so much, thank you from the bottom of my ❤.  Day and night they are all still there for us all and I'm eternally grateful.",5
They avoid issues anything they find hard they do xray on area they knows OK frauds,1
"At the breast clinic today, they was very nice, both drs was amazing, explaining everything, the nurses was very caring, this hospital has always been amazing throughout my yrs of hving to go in for one thing and another, thank god for our NHS staff. Thankyou.",5
"Minor ops unit absolutely fantastic.  Knowledgeable, no unnecessary waiting. Attended with a chest burn and I have to say the nurse who dressed it today has done a 1st class job. All staff kind and respectful. Well done",5
"Staff threatened me for saying I wanted to go home
Security is rude
Staff are so nosey
Slagging me and my mum off for no reason",1
"Admitted, not knowing the reason why... had a lot of pain in my back... also shortness of breath. Had to wait overnight before they could do xray and mri scan knowing I've be there 24hrs before.  Disgusting how the night staff treated me while going through turmoil. Transferred to another unit AMC.  Sheet not changed until discharged and no breakfast given due to broken machine toaster had to buy my own",1
"During a very worrying time I am very disappointed with the care I received from good Hope hospital , I went in due to painful cramping at 11 +6 days pregnant, I was seen quite quickly in A&E. The experience itself was scary I had no one with me, then when I was seen the lady took my urine sample, blood pressure and informed me I could take paracetamol and left me in the room for around 20 minutes by myself when I heard the lady on the ward say to another memeber of staff “I’ll ring up the ward and see what they want me to do with her”.Another lady came in informed me “they will ring you on Monday for an appointment” I have no clue who they are for starters and was sent home worried sick about wether or not the cramps was associated with a miscarriage as I knew this was one of the symptoms. I felt like no one cared I am truly disgusted in the support I got from the nhs that day and to think we pay taxes for the hospital care we receive to be treated in this way is appalling I understand the nhs is very busy but every patient matters.",1
"Tracey from a n e minors is one of the best patronising beings on the planet, her an her colleagues have no experience with mental health. I personally watched her antagonise a lady who clearly had mental health problems. I was in the waiting room and it extremely uupset me how this lady was treated. I left and went to another hospital and I have contacted pals. The in humane nature and attitude of the Dr's and nurses in minors was absolutely shocking and I would think if this was to be investigated it would be closed down due to unfit care. The fact that they are being paid to abuse patients has sickened me. No empathy she should not be a nurse",1
The staff of SDEC helped to save my right leg following a severe infection. They're great people who do their jobs in a caring & professional manner.,5
"It is very easy to knock the NHS, but at the same time it's only right to give credit where it's due..On the couple of occasions that I have had the misfortune to go to A&E at Good Hope(the most recent being last night due to an electric cooker burn), I have found that all the staff that dealt with me have been very professional and caring. And the waiting times haven't been too unreasonable either. The main issue though, as with many hospitals is the often difficult parking and high parking charges.",4
"I would like to relate my recent experience with the Heart of England Trust regarding my bowel cancer diagnosis and treatment.
At the age of 60 this was my first time of being admitted to hospital therefore totally new to me and unaware of what to expect but of course I was very apprehensive.
First experience was Dr Ahmed with the colposcopy team, I won't mention individual names as I cannot recall all of them and it would be unfair to name only some, the team was extremely efficient, reassuring, friendly and certainly put me at ease during what was to be a devastating diagnosis for me.
I was then admitted to ward 16 at Good Hope for surgery under Mr Korsgon and his team, again all the staff were efficient, very hardworking and friendly.
Later on I underwent a PICC line insertion at Heartlands, again excellent experience with Matt and his team providing friendly reassurance at Heartlands.
I am currently undergoing chemotherapy in the Sheldon unit at Good Hope, again staff are very knowledgeable, reassuring and friendly during a such harrowing process.
I have found the staff throughout the Trust from the cleaners through to the consultants to be highly professional, caring and friendly. The Trust should be very proud of their staff.
The few down sides of my treatment were:
The temperature of the wards during May/July was unbearably hot, not helpful to aid recovery or for the welfare of the staff.
Discharge procedure, I was informed at 9am that I was being discharged yet finally left at 5.30pm. I was discharged without being given my anti blood clotting injections, I was informed two days later that I should have received these extremely important items, together with instructions of how to administer them, there appeared  to be chaos whilst the syringes were couriered to me and then left for me to arrange for my GP surgery to provide instruction on how to administer them, luckily I didn't have wait the usual two weeks for an appointment.
Following my PICC line insertion procedure I was given a form for a ""Limbo"" cover, this is a cover for the dressing to keep it dry when showering, I then had to take it to my GP to raise a prescription which takes 72 hours, I then took the prescription to a main pharmacy who had to order it, therefore several days passed before I could have a shower, I happen to drive so I could undertake the various journeys a lot easier than a bus user. If the Limbo covers were kept at the hospital it save a lot of unnecessary journeys and time resulting in a much improved patient service.
Car parking - charges are excessive, same rate as parking in the centre of Birmingham, this is a tax on seriously ill patients including cancer sufferers and their loved ones.
Apologies for the long missive but feel I need to show my appreciation of the treatment received so far and hopefully the Trust will take on board my comments where the patient care could be improved.",4
"Absolutely dreadful waiting times.

Went in with my mother after she was feeling dizzy with high blood pressure for 12 hours.. spent the next 9 here.

Doctors did a blood analysis for a heart attack and sent her home with some aspirin saying it's not that. Didn't even check for anything else.

If you have the opportunity, avoid this hospital. Had similar bad experiences with other family members.

They don't give you answers, only check for the most common issues.

Patients are treated as a statistical average rather than individuals.",1
"Went to Good Hope Hospital today. A very pleasant and welcoming experience from all the staff. Could not have asked for better service from the staff in the ""Treatment Centre"", Mr Marco and his team. Sincere thanks to all, especially on Mothers Day.",5
MRI requested to go back to this hospital as the MRI staff go above and beyond 15/07/23 3 ladies were brilliant thankyou got me through it,5
"Attended heartlands ambulatory care on Tuesday, was treated brilliantly and told to come back if I had any further issues. Late Wednesday evening I was suffering again however the heartlands dept closed at 8:30. Good hope is my nearest a&e so I went there. 3 hour wait to be seen by a rude and harsh nurse who clearly didn’t want to work there. Given dissolvable paracetamol which did nothing as I couldn’t swallow. Eventually after 6 hours saw a dr who sent me home. No blood tests. No nurses had wrote in my notes, was just a complete waste of time. I left good hope and have returned to heartlands today where I have been admitted and looked after amazingly.

Patients were coming in from ambulances and having to wait. One lady clearly needed a resus bed and was left waiting for two hours. Every time you asked a question you got a generic reply that didn’t actually help. I will not be attending this a&e Department again. Having worked in the Children’s a&e myself I am well aware how difficult the job is but patients were not even being cared for correctly.",1
Came in Saturday night 11-15pmvery I'll was seen very quickly and put on drips ASAP yes was on trolley for a while but never neglected. Then was put on ward as soon as it was possible looked after brilliantly by very hard working staff. Would go there again if necessary without hesitation.,5
Waited over 13 hrs in excruciating pain blood passing and sickness sat on a school chair for the entire time. Bowels exploded because of this and Am now suing the nhs! Which doesn’t help with the fact my bowels exploded staff are so rude act like gangsters and use intimidating methods say they are in a broken system so couldn’t give a toss abt your health! This is the worst hospital in the world that is for sure. I would rather drive three hrs away to a better hospital to try and be seen. The nhs are on there way out for sure!! So bad what is happening to Britain but don’t rely on the systems we tax payers pay for none work!!,1
"A good local hospital, accident and emergency is very hectic and the a&e area isn't as good as it used to be since they changed it all about, no disabled parking or anywhere to drop off patients, the main hospital isn't too bad if you have an appointment but if not expect a long wait",4
"This is a great hospital. They really looked after my mom after the two occasions she was rushed into A&E, for her heart problems. The second time she was kept in for a few days, and all the ward nurses were fantastic. They took really good care of her. And they were happy to answer any questions that the family had. Can't praise this hospital enough.",5
"Disgusting service. Attended here yesterday evening with my partner who is currently undergoing scans for possible appendicitis. Upon attending the Majors department, my partner who at the time had to sit on the floor he was in that much pain. Nurses walking past him, I had to grab the attention of a nurse to actually be booked in. Was told there was a 6 hours wait, which I understand Hospitals get busy. However due to the nature and severity of my partners condition I thought this would have been prioritised! no painkillers could be given until the doctor had arrived. The nurse showed no empathy at all. The service at this hospital is absolutely shocking, lack of professionlism and I will be putting forward a formal complaint with regards to the lack of care my partner has received.",1
In and out mind you it's the quickest I've been seen,4
"I can't rate lower than 1 star. :( You go there with a child and you wait 4 hours before a doctor can see him for 3 minutes. Then, you wait 2 more hours for a nurse to pick up a urine sample, 2 more hours for the doctor to come back and say ""you can go"". Unbelievable, it's difficult for adults... think about children! 🤮 NHS 🤮 Moat of the nurses are arrogant, some of them will sometimes ask you if you want some water, tea or a sandwich, which is nice.",1
"Been to good hope twice now in the past 2 months. First time for a biopsy and second time for a MRI scan. Can say, both times very good.  Good doctors and nurses. Good care over all, especially considering Covid-19.",5
"Noor khans wife,

i wish to thank all of ITU staff.
Day staff and night staff with out your help and determination my husband would not be hear to day.

Me and his kids thank you all for helping him recover and get well.

Not yet fully recovered but he is getting there and hope fully will come back to his family home very soon.

Thank you from the bottom of our hearts to all the staff that have helped him thank you really appreciate it",5
"I was admitted to A&E at good hope who went me to SAU.   I can honestly say that the nurses although busy they were amazing.
I was scared about going to this hospital due to all of the negative comments I have heard before.

I have asked for all of my appointments to be at this hospital.  Far better than any others I have attended

Thank you for restoring my trust",5
Absolute joke. 3.1/2 hours for an eye appointment.  Bunch of cow boys.,1
"Not even worth the 1 star. Worse hospital I've ever come across. Very lengthy waits to be seen, 5 hours to be precise. Hospital poorly managed & waiting area very dingy and uncomfortable. Be sure to pack blanket & cushions to sit on. Staff very unhelpful and unwilling to provide important on waiting times etc. Again the worse hospital experience ever!!! Avoid Avoid Avoid!!! I will never attend this hospital again. I came with breathing difficulties and was left waiting in waiting area with very uncomfortable seating for 6 hours. Left hospital with breathing difficulties and severe back pain.",1
"This hospital took my life from me when I was 26. Due to them being short staffed they could not continue my labour induction so told me I HAD to have a csection that I did not want. It was rushed, I was cut before I was numb and held down on the table with a gas mask pressed on my face after I had jumped off when she cut into me. 8yrs on my abdom organs are stuck together, my bowel doesnt work, im in constant severe pain and more or less housebound. I had meetings with them and they admitted they were short staffed and apologised, the Dr who done the surgery had left the country so they couldnt get her ‘side’, my notes were tampered with, results went missing. I stayed under them for over 5yrs with no moving forward before seeing a Dr at the Womens hospital who that same day found id had internal bleeding for those 5yrs and diagnosed other conditions they had caused! They are irreversible, cant be fixed and only increasingly get worse. They took mine and my childrens lives, they have missed out on so much because of them. Due to this being my local hospital, ive had to attend A&E there several times and find no change, on my most recent visit I was unable to control my pain, was bleeding a lot and id not go near there if it wasnt an emergency but I was left on a trolley for over 8hrs in a corridor which seems a recurrent problem there, people are not even assessed straight away but can wait hours for this. Then after 9hrs of me being there I saw a Dr and they were just sending me home so I went straight to my GP who wanted me to see a surgical team immediately! So after 9hrs there they were neglectful again!
My Grandfather attended with chest pain after previous heart attacks which needed surgery and he too was left waiting 8hrs+ before seeing a doctor.
Stay clear of this hospital, they ruin and take lives away more than they save. Heartlands is the next best option or the Womens/QE if you can get there - its worth the longer journey to know youll be safe and looked after rather than be harmed and have your life ruined like mine. Minus 5 stars is what they truelly deserve.",1
"Popped in an empty A&E, went to reception to see 4 receptionist ladies not with any patients (probably on Facebook) ignoring my existence. Could have at least had the decency to acknowledge me and asked me to wait. On the other hand, my other half was treated with the most utmost care (mostly). Bit of a hit and miss at the same time.",3
Im currently sat in ward 8 now and what a useless dump place needs bulldozing. Broke a vertebrae in my back and being moved too 3 wards that have nothing too do with this sort of injury. With the ward that does refusing too have me if negligence was a joke this place would get the biggest laugh.,1
"Good hope is my local hospital. I have had many experiences there, In the A&E, x-rays, operations and specialist appointments. My experiences vary, some good and some bad. Some instances I witnessed potentially serious mistakes. I've witnessed or been on the recieving end of shocking levels of disrespect and poor attitude. Over all the one thing I can say for certain is all staff work hard, the care about the patients, especially children and go out of their way to help even when off duty.",4
"Recently had a routine appointment in x-ray.  Was seen on time, with the greatest of courtesy by the nursing staff and the radiologist in the Ultrasound Dept.  Really couldn't ask for a better service from my local hospital.  Too easy to write a bad review, perhaps more patients should take the time to praise the staff when they absolutely get it right.",5
"Mixed feelings about the place. Some nursing care was ok. Others dangerous. My Father was left for 9 hours with no food, drink, meds or turning. I looked after him full time and supplied the food for the peg feed and meds and looked after him for the first 48 hours in hospital. but I had to go to a dentist appointment and he was totally neglected for 9 hours. I photographed his notes and left a marker in his bed to see if he would have received and contact. He had not. The consultant I would give 10 out of 10 other doctors left a lot to be desired. I could not recommend the place to relatives of the elderly.",2
Nice amazing ward amu thanks to nurses 👍,5
"I love this hospital for its efficient outpatient's and consultant's departments.
We have always been treated with the utmost care and consideration.
Only major complaint is the difficulty parking let alone the cost. Depending on the time, early morning easy, visiting times - difficult. I have on a number of occasions had to park on the road 0.5mile away.
Now considering the amount of income they must produce from parking charges, why oh why can't they build a multi storey?
Taxing the sick with parking charges is disgusting. The older you are the more you need to visit and pay and the less you earn!! (larger family, births, health checks and your own illness).",3
"Pure and simple, I owe my life to this hospital. On 17th June I suffered a collapsed lung and was rushed to A&E at Good Hope, processed by staff very efficiently moved to AMU ward where a drain was inserted, and my lung was reinflated. Two days later, was moved to ward 10. Nursing and all Medical staff excellent. Only complaint is that communication between staff at shift change is a little less than expected. Also only one Doctor on duty covering too many wards is basic understaffing. Lack of communication between Doctors made weekend discharge a little bit fraught.

I am alive thanks only to the dedication of all staff for their professional, caring attitude to their patients",5
Absolutely fantastic this morning. The receptionist was extremely kind. I presented with a live bug that had flown into my inner ear as I was on my way to work. The nurse and assistant were nothing but brilliant. The damn thing was still alive when they pulled it out! Thanks so much A&E dept I am very grateful,5
"Carina (possibly Karina, not sure of spelling sorry) on ward 2 is an absolute angel. Very patient and kind and compassionate. Very anxious patient but she has been so good with everything. Fetching meds, helping me get up post surgery, listening when I broke down. Anyone looked after by her is in extremely good hands.",5
"My 85yr old mum was admitted about 4hrs ago with a suspected stroke... not allowed to go with her because of covid restrictions and not been able to get through to anybody to check in her... been trying for 45mins now.. keep getting passed around then cut off!  Its disgusting, how am i supposed to know if my mum is ok",1
"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is out of consideration of the nurses; cleaning and catering employees, who were honestly amazing and each do a hell of a lot more than their fair share of work.

The treatment from doctors, on the other hand, is beyond appalling. My elderly grandad was in a bed in either a corridor or a&e for 16 hours before he was finally moved on to a ward. He is 80 years old and had a practically collapsed lung. To say that I'm disgusted with their level of care is an understatement.
It wasn't the case of asking once or twice to be seen or if we could get any stronger pain killers proscribed. It was more like ask 3 or 4 times over a couple of hours and things might start to happen; we even had one doctor forget that we were even there.

When they'd finally came to see is it was so obvious that they wanted to spend as little time as possible. They would talk so fast and would barely look at him while speaking. They came across as increidably arrogant and that could not care less that not only did we not understand what they were saying but mostly could not even hear them.
I'm saying 'they' because we never saw the same doctor twice. This in itself shows their infrequent visits.
All they seemed to be doing is ordering more and more bloods tests to be taken... it became an joke to call them 'vampires'

Would never recommend this place to anyone seeking urgent medical attention espically the elderly and would definitely never chance it over weekends, one nurse mentioned that there was 1 doctor for 6 wards of patients that roughly 20 per ward.
Good Hope is severly understaffed and their organisation is utterly terrible.",2
My dad was referred from Queen Elizebeth hospital to good hope hospital  for a gallstone bladder removal i have to say staff from good hope are Amazing from receptionist jane to bobby dasari mark chapman and all  rest of staff from the  day case unit Couldnt ask for Amazing staff my father thanks good hope hospital for all they done better then QE not once did staff lie about beds etc fantastic for a small hospital should extend it and make it Larger. thank u Good hope hospital.,5
"Attended a&e with my dad yesterday after being told he couldn't be seen by a gp and being told the walk in centre at Warren farm couldn't help, he was to go home and speak to his gp...
Cannot express how incredible every single member of staff was in the a&e department. From the initial triage nurse who highlighted the severity of my dad's condition to the assessing nurse who acted quickly and made my dad as comfortable as possible.
The 3 doctors and one consultant who attended him, assessing him thoroughly and keeping us up to date and informed on the plan for his care and treatment.
The nurses who were clearly stretched, the hca's (Trudy who was being pulled every which way but who was still smiling and helpful) and the cleaners who were polite and constantly going round the ward ensuring it was clean and workable.
The whole team were outstanding and I cannot thank them enough.
I'd like to add I attended a&e in Telford with my husband before Christmas and the two departments could not be further apart. Shropshire CCG and SaTH trust could learn a lot from the this a&e department.",5
"Once again I was left with no choice but to take my wife to no hope hospital and was reminded as to why I avoid this place whenever I can. It's been 3.5 hours and we still haven't even had our assessment yet. Once again we are being pushed back further behind people who come in after us because aparently chest pains and passing blood isn't a high priority. What a joke this place is. Somebody has just gone before us who felt 'a bit woozy'..... staff on majors reception COMPLETELY IGNORE YOU even when they can hear you asking a question and you are standing right infront of them, they don't even look at you. Honestly. This is one of the worst hospitals I've been to around the world. I don't know why I keep coming back here.

The most efficient hospitals I have been to have run by doing people's assessment as they come in THEN determining what are the important cases, not guessing which is the most important before people have actually been assessed. It's ludicrous.",1
My Dad who has terminal cancer went in with C. Diff. Whilst on the ward he had a covid test which came back positive and we was told he was being moved to a covid ward. Luckily a member of staff questioned the result because he wasn't showing any symptoms of covid and he was in a side room by himself and full ppe worn and barrier control in place. His second test was negative and they had been given another patients result. This could of been catastrophic for my Dad but also there would of been an undiagnosed patient on a ward.😠😠😠😠Formal complaint lodged,1
"G4stupid trying to threw a guy out who was waiting to pick up his wife, was not wearing a SIA badge and just wanted to go hands on.",1
Came in streaming cold flu bug possible lung infection. No Beds stuck on a Trolly don’t have tissues told to use hand towels. So short of staff woman on icu been on from 7am walked out to go home 10 pm no one to cover very disappointed. 7 hours since last cup of Tea night ow trying to dry my used Tissues as running out . Still on a Trolly 18 hours later.your told to ring when drip ends so press button 35 mins later they come good job I was not having a heart attack. Found out after it was Covid was so very ill thought i would never come out Alive,2
We as Christopher's  parents would like to thank everyone from the paramedics who first saw him to everyone on ward 11 and all others who were involved with his care and support during   his time in the hospital fighting Covid.  We hope for all of you  you soon will be able to take a long hard sigh for a job well done.,5
I have been ringing up for 3 days trying to find out where my wife is in this hospital for 2 to 3 hours at a time each day . Please answer the phone not everone has a mobileor knows how to operate one. Beast thing to do sack all high level Managment. They want this hospital closed so they can sell off the land for biulding on.And move it all to Heart lands where it will be wors run by the clever.,1
"Hate to put the nhs down but this place is everything the health service shouldn’t be. Disorganised, would be an understatement, three hours in a&e without pain relief. Brought back in after two days for a scan then told imperative I stay in. Then discharged a day later after a dose of antibiotics I could have taken at home. Ended up sleeping in a waiting room as bay was so noisy and staff made enough noise to wake the dead. Loads mor e to tell like no Id tag for several hours after being admitted etc etc",1
"I have had absolutely brilliant service and help from Good Hope. They have always gone the extra mile during my pregnancy and I'm looking forward to giving birth there. The staff have really been kind, compassionate and helpful.

I'd recommend it to anyone.",5
"My child has always received great care from paediatric ED, CAU and PATCH team. Very grateful.",5
"One of the most ridiculous A&E's I've ever attended in my 30 years on this planet. Rushed to take my 8 week pregnant partner there at 12.30am as she had been exposed to carbon monoxide from a faulty boiler. White as a ghost, chest pains, shortness of breath, headache and tummy pains. The nurse took her vitals fairly quickly, but was then told it was a 5 hour wait because there were no doctors available to do bloods and other vitals, disgusting. As far as I'm aware that was the very definition of an emergency. Next time we'll ring 999 and have an ambulance attend and treat her at home, what a waste of time & resources. Would get 0 stars if I could.",1
"I was diagnosed with bowel cancer following an endoscopy and was in Good Hope from October 2013 until may 2014. During that time I had wonderful treatment and was treated with both kindness and consideration by ALL. I cannot speak highly enough of Mr Mark Chapman (Consultant Surgeon) and his team.
Thank you Good Hope without you I probably wouldn't be alive today

"I attended the day case unit on 26 October for an open incisional hernia repair.  I would like to thank Mr Khaira and his team, the anaesthetists and all of the nurses involved. The care I received was exceptional and I was cared for with kindness and compassion. Top marks to you all, you are a credit to the NHS. Thank you very much.",5
"My Aunt, aged 94 was admitted after two falls. A&E a shambles though staff lovely.
She went onto a ward at 3am.
Each time I visited given different information. Nurses saying they didn't know basic facts. She was given antibiotics, didn't know why. I suggested water infection, told not given for that. Checked with my son, a Consultant, yes they do.
There is so much I could say but would need to write a book. She cannot see, cannot cope but told Social Worker she could do after short consultation they decided she was ok to go home. She lives alone, registered partially sighted. It is a joke.
I know that NHS under lot of pressure but it's a disgrace. So she will probably fall again and have to go back in. Farcical.",1
Me and my big sister visit it on Monday evening and we wait for a little a will but got seen very busy on that day with people come and going on. I got seen then. The nurse was very good with me. But the promble is if I want on my owe they would have to come to me and call my name not shout out then I could hear it. Very good service at accident and emergency no problem a tall.you.  but they need to came and fine you frist we wait in the area ok. And it  a bit small for my  liking ok but that me caroline Johnston Sutton Coldfield,5
"Ok what a surprise to find myself here on ward 14.
All I can say is everyone I have had the pleasure of dealing with have, as you expect been wonderful. Not being a local and in an hour (4 days of) need, I have been treated like royalty.

I can’t thank everyone enough xxx",5
"NO HOPE HOSPITAL. Unit 17 SAU is a joke, 20 hours spent in there over the last 3 days. Girlfriends had 3 days off work without pay and extortionate carpark rates. Had an Emergency referral by GP for polycystic ovaries.
On Monday the nurse read out a woman's results in front of the waiting room giving her details and blood results. Another nurse couldn't take blood and stabbed her arms multiple times, hitting nerves in her arms. My girlfriend had to point out the vain to take blood from her arm. 4.5 hours later a Surgeon said he'd arrange scans and X-rays for Wednesday as we wasn't staying past 11pm. He examined her and could feel the cyst under the skin. Depending on results he'd operate the week after.

Wednesday she arrived at 9:15 via train and bus, spend 5 hours waiting just to find out the hospital hadn't told X-rays about her appointment and had to go in the next day. She asked for a sick note to give to work and received a 2 hours (9:30-11:30) sick note. Takes 2 hours to get there and back. Also her surgeon had decided to go on a 2 week holiday.

Thursday arrived at 9:15 via bus and train. Had blood tests taken again to check for appendicitis, unsure why but told them she didn't have it and that is wasn't why she was there. Had bloods and X-rays done.  A giant cyst on top of the ovary which needed to be removed was seen along with all the cysts. She went out for a smoke and the new surgeon took in a patients visitor thinking it was my girlfriend into a separate room to examine her. Breaching patient confidentiality. When results came she was told by a surgeon that she didn't have appendicitis and could go home. After explain she was there for her ovaries the surgeon said she should see a professional. When asking for a picture of her ovaries the surgeon was rude. I witnessed a nurse shouting at patients and relatives. Complete lack of respect and I'm shocked they did nothing about the reason she went in.
Going in for  polycystic ovaries and being told that she doesn't have appendicitis is a joke. Staff are rude, don't listen and forget about patients being there. Making a formal complaint and going into A LOT MORE detail. Shut the place down because non of them care as staff were quite happy to point out on the SAU in UNIT 17.",1
"My recent stay in Good Hope resulting from an emergency was a surprise to me, but I have only praise and respect for all the hospital staff who took very good care of me.
My particular thanks go to all those serving on the cardiac ward. Thanks a million,and though I,m late in saying so, A  VERY  HAPPY  CHRISTMAS TO ALL OF YOU.",5
"This hospital does not live up to its name!!! Went in via ambulance as I could not walk. Was left in corridor of the A&E. My partner asked after an  hour as to how long it will be before I was seen as we was told there was an hour wait. To be told I was still 3rd in the que. So after 2 hours he asked again to then be told people who had come in via ambulance had gone before me, My partner then questioned this as I was also bought in via ambulance. 2 mins later I got wheeled into the nurses cubicle to be told by the nurse it was his fault because of my age he THOUGHT  I had walked in by this time my legs where still bad. This is all down to my back which I have had a problem with. After this I got wheeled back out to corridor to wait for a doctor to see me. I waited another 30 minutes for this. She came in and I had to explain everything once again for the 4th time (Do they not read notes)  she tested the strength in my legs and then went and looked at my MRI scan I had 2 weeks prior. She came back and said that they will give me diazapan, diclphinc morphine and cocodamol and see how I am then. A nurse came in to give me my diazapan and diclphinc. She handed me the tablet and told me there was a toliet down the corridor for me to put the diclphinc up. I looked at my sister and then looked back at nurse and said I can not walk. ""Oh"" she said , can you get on your side you can also do it that way. Errrr no...... She then with a disgust attitude said do you want me to do it...... After this I went to the observation ward where the nurse was very nice gave me the morphine and cocodamol. After a couple of hours the doctor came back and asked me to get out of bed to see if I can walk now. (Of course I could with the amount of drugs I had in me)  she went back to her consultant and came back said I could go home with morphine and diazapan and to go see me doctor tomorrow. There was no discharge note nothing.... I will NOT be using this hospital again. And would not recommend it to anyone.....",1
I had a hernia operation on the  7th of oct 2016 and i was blown away by the amazing service and care i was given. From the reception to surgeon i was so impressed. The nurses were fantastic and they made what was a stressful day go so smooth. I can't praise them highly enough. Well done team on   day surgery. Your a credit to your pprofession.,5
I had to take my partner to Good Hope Hospital because my local hospital had no beds available. I arrived at A&E and asked for asisstance to get to Maternity. As we arrived at the reception the receptionist was accompanied by a paramedic who rather sit on her backside than help someone in desperate need. It was really stressful witnessing my wife go through all that pain. Shame on you 'so called paramedic'.,1
"Had one of the worlds worst experience in this hospital!!! I would never recommend any one to come here, i was ready to give birth and the nurse kept sending me home i knew its time for the baby to come but still the nurse kept sending me home, it was to the point they showed me the door to go and as i was leaving i had my baby then and there on the floor!!!! Either this hospital has un experience nurses or they are very careless. The nurses/midwifes  are very rude and does not know how to handle the situation!!!! PLEASE AVOID THIS HOSPITAL IF YOU WISH BEST FOR YOUR FAMILY.",1
"Regarding Acute Medical Unit.
If i could give it less than 1 star I would.
This ward is so badly run that a bunch of kittens in scrubs would do a better job.
In what world is it acceptable for a person with suspected septicaemia, violent shaking and sweating temperature to be left unseen for 6 hours?
No one seems to care in this ward. You might as well accept your immeninent death.
If this was my only bad experience here then I would no write such a terrible review but after several trips over the years with various family members I can unequivocally say that this ward is an absolute s**t show!",1
"Heart unit is very good and so are wards 16/17 (Surgical), but we had bad experiences with my Mum in the elderly wards a couple of years ago - all the usual stuff - bells not being answered, drinks out of reach, not fed properly inappropriate medication). I do not believe that this was an isolated case. They wer not good with dementia patients especially at night.
Recently, we also had a wait from 7pm to 3.30am in AMU (cute Medical unit) as the result of an URGENT GP referral for my wife for heart tests. These were not carried out for 5 - 6 hours after arrival - and we left by agreement, without the results. Organisation seemed more than a little below par. Best plan is to arrive by ambulance to A and E.",2
"I'm currently sat in A&E & I can't begin to express my gratitude to every team member of this department, they are a credit to  our worn down tired & over used NHS!!! I'm with a very poorly relative, who has been seen to promptly, efficiently, in that time I have observed all aspects of this department & truly believe each one shouks be given a gold medal!!! Thank you thank you thank you for all you do xx",5
"Couldn't fault the children's A&E tonight... My baby woke up with breathing difficulties which improved by the time I got to the hospital.. Woke up at 2 am.. Seen by the triage nurse, doctor, diagnosed, medication given, home and back in bed with the baby fast asleep at 4.30 am.. If only every visit could be as quick and efficient.",5
"Slow, staff inadequate and sometimes clueless as to why you're at the hospital to begin with. Numerous occasions the staff are sat around chatting and not working - waste of tax money imo. Long and unnecessary waiting times, even when not busy. Would only reccomend if you enjoy wasting your day waiting around. Only positive, there is a pub over the road.",1
Went for COVID booster vaccination. Fast efficient service,4
"I just want to say a big massive thank you to all of your team for helping me after unexpected quick birth and you have looked after myself and my daughter in intensive care and giving her all your full support every single one staff is brilliant, and i cant thank you enough for the help you have given. My family are very happy and you have really given my daughter a very good future and all if your staff are very lovely and helpful i will be writing a letter to the head office for a lovely clean hospital 😀

"Good Hope Hospital Sutton Coldfield

I was given a” book your appointment “ Booking reference Number and access code by letter from my GP surgery.
Ok no available slots on three Hospitals, it’ states online system, says contact a number to speak to assistant, ok.
The person repeats what I have already said and done online.
She then says we will contact you with an appointment, ok.if not contact on a 0121 ###
I given dates I will not be available due to over seas.
I contacted the last number and then a person very unprofessional answered, and after confirmation of who I am, said we will send an appointment.
I replied that’s why I am ringing because I have no contact from Good hope hospital or appointment given within the information they given me before.
Because of sounding incompetent, I wanted to confirm the above dates I had given on first telephone call.  No we don’t have anything.

So I had to give them again. And she said we will send you an appointment.
Back to square one, I said do you not have a system that is available to book availability because you may send an appointment when I’m away on the dates given. “No” if you can’t make the appointment we can change when you ring up.
God help me. She don’t like her job or can’t be bothered and some people telephone skills may help.

If this is the future, no wonder The NHS is a mess.",1
Had an antenatal appointment today the sonographers are fantastic I cannot complain about them but as for the consultants they are utterly terrible 3 hr wait in a hot waiting room while they stand around . Get told the reason I have to see them is that my baby is not growing properly wen in actual fact there is nothing wrong with her  no apology for the upset or the stress causes . Left the hospital today feeling shaken and my head banging I would not recommend mum's to be going there at all,1
"Had a brilliant team of nurses,doctors,surgeons and hospital staff, looked after me at the good hope hospital, day case unit ,after my gall bladder removal ,they were kind ,respectful and i felt cared for, also they looked after partner ,who was able to have special permission to stay with me  ,as i suffer with anxiety ,they all went above and beyond THANKS so much",5
"I have been to this hospital many times always good.But on the 6th September I rang 11 who advised me to go to Good Hope following a bad bout of Sickness and upset stomach with pain.I arrived about 10.pm and got through to see a nurse about 11.30 Put a Canulla in took blood,blood pressure and temperature.I was then left in a room the only people that came in were nurses and they just kept asking my name wasn’t offered a drink no medication or asked if I was ok.I did go and ask when I would be seeing a doctor and nobody knew.At 9 in the morning still there asked again and was told I was being moved to Majors B,Didn’t see anybody until about 11am felt really unwell no sleep all night don’t even know who I saw then she said I could come home still not well today Sunday 11th.Worst experience I have ever had no care no compassion I was very upset.There we’re also other things to many to mention.I never want to go back here again.What on Earth has happened?",1
"This hospital is fantastic, the service I have had is exceptional, they fitted me a pacemaker in November 2015 and since then they have been following up to ensure my heart is functioning as good as it possibly can. All the staff work hard and look after you, nothing is too much trouble.
Thank you everyone.",5
"Terrible service, reception do not care, you cannot get through for Love nor money, when you do, they put the phone down. Surely a receptionists job is to provide service, information and genuinely be ready to help others! This is not the case at good hope. Rude!",1
"ABSOLUTELY APPAULING HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!
Told us that my nan was at ''end of life'' and let us visit for 5 days on the trot last week before then questioning what we were doing there by the ward sister. She looked at my nans information to then tell us my nan isn't at end of life and she doesn't know why we were told this! The distress and upset this has caused us all is unbelievable!  HOW CAN A HOSPITAL GET THIS WRONG? Absolutely shocking!!!",1
"During the visits to this hospital since december 2012 involving a variety of treatment i can only comment that throughout all this time i have alwaysreceived nothing but amazing treatment,never having to wait ,every one i saw was charming . courteous and caring   Yesterday i woke up with a heart rate of 100 mph could hardly walk fearing the worst .Within six minutes an ambulance arrived a quick E.C.G .I was taken to your hospital by two delightful medics. From then on i received treatment second to none   consultants  nurses and of course TREVOR whose knowledge  respect by everyone was quite obvious.  Thank you Trevor you were ace . Late afternoon i walked the length of the road to `Tamworth Road about a mile    My wife had forgotten me but we have been married a long long time.

Good and clean hospital. Staff was very friendly. Car park prices are very reasinable,5
"absolutely awful
do not go to this hospital in an emergency, you will most likely bleed to death
previously waited 5 hours to have a cast removed from my wrist
most recently (this week) attended a&e, was there from 9am-1pm with a toenail that was clearly infected and hanging on after becoming detached from both skin and nail bed after someone treading on my foot, after being seen i was sent away, toe not even washed or dressed. I later that day attended a walk inc centre where my toe was washed and dressed and given antibiotics as it was confirmed it was infected.",1
"This hospital is terrible, went in for day surgery first question was do you know what you come in for to which I replied two moles to be removed,  then to be asked where they was I said they should be write down not a clue.. then half way through the op I get asked by the surgeon have I had my covid vaccine to which i replied no as i don't want it.   Then to be asked again by the nurse's why not have you seen the people on the covid ward it felt like I was being integrated ..... I do not come into hospital to be questioned about my freedom of choice it is not mandatory so it's my choice weather I want that put into my body ........ the matter has been passed on to pals but there again not much help there ,",1
"I had to attend the minor injuries unit in the morning, I was seen immediately and the staff were amazing, very professional, genuinely caring and helpful. I can't fault my experience here.",4
"Terrible service again, 7 hours on a trolley for an 87 year old man fitting with pain with suspected spinal problems. He spent 2 more hours before seeing a doctor and was released back to his family 5 days later with no other directives other than to monitor his toilet visits. He has slept for a whole day, defacated and urinated in his bed 3 times and is unable to feed himself as he cant stop shaking.  I have been told by the hospital to either bring him in again by ambulance and face another 7 hour wait or call 111.",1
"Locals call it no hope hospital for good reason, my Dad was a patient there when they neglected him and just let him die . Cruel horrible evil place,",1
"Waste of time i will never go back there any more. seven hours wating at (A&E)  the joke is only two pepole was wating when i arrived .they kept sending me from one department  to second maybe four departments i went to they make me wait hours and after that they tell me you need to go back from where you started and start from the beginning very poor service ,staff needs good communication skills after 7 hours wating without been seen by a doctor.  I end up going to city hospital and guess what in one hour i was seen had an xray and medication was given .i have learnt my lesson now.",1
Absolutely horrendous service. Landed at A&E at 5.30pm left at 2.40am..my son had severe breathing problems didnt see anyone for over 2 hours. He spent this time struggling for breath. 2 hours after that actially saw a doctor. Waiting area was chaos. Elderly couple just left waiting. Reception staff unhelpful and lied about waiting time. Majors department looked like a 3rd world war zone....SHOCKING,1
"We are not happy with the waiting time. Every time when we pop in with the little one , the waiting time is like 3-4 hours. In Burton hospital is different treatment. Early you get in early they take you . Friendly team . Waiting time is maxim 20 min -half hour. I took some pictures in the toilets , disgusting, I fell like I’m going back in time with 100 years . Come on guys !",1
"AVIOD, AVIOD, AVIOD!!! Waiting times of 6 hours, people sitting on the floor waiting, beds in corridors. The staff have a duty of care but they just don’t. They do not prioritise on condition or risk. Absolutely shameful service. I completely blame the hospital for not managing workload and prioritising. Poor management, poor organisation and poor processes.",1
Gave my dad covid and then sent him home . He then gave it to my mum . He died 3 weeks later in heartlands . My mum couldn’t  say goodbye to him as she was in the QE . She spent the night on her own the night her partner of 57 years  passed away,1
"Outdated parking facilities! Next time i will ask the emergency service to go to Burton as yo can pay via an app unlike good hope where no one comes to the ""hatch""! Thus system is at least 20 yrs old! Get it sorted!",1
I have been a&e for 2.30 min people came after me been seen by doctors every time I went to ask the nurse for how long she’s so rude and ignorant not a good experience,1
I aproached the nurse and security guard told the nurse why i was there who then decided i wasnt getting to see anyone at the same time said security guard told me to leave which i did I then contacted 111 who told me i had to go to a hospital i asked for heartlands who admitted me straight away put me on a drip and i have been here for 3 days i felt ignored and insulted as when i looked back both were laughing,1
"Fantastic care and treatment in the minors department today, cannot fault the staff and the treatment provided ,how amazing are out NHS staff 😁",5
My 16 year old daughter got sent to amu at 5.30pm from gp... its 4.30am and she's still there with her dad...  nurse said don't know when she be seen. Not in a bed still sat in waiting area. If i could give no stars I would.. disgusting treatment,1
"Had to wait 45 minutes to collect my cream which they were giving me, then after i recieved the cream, was using for 3 weeks when the rash on arm was not going. Rang the pharmacy and they said the hospital had gave me a completly different cream which was a form of steroid! Bad mistake",1
Definitely called No Hope for a reason. Got a horrible nurse at the end of her shift who couldn’t be bothered to help me did no observations and sent me home after telling me to take paracetamol for my problem.,1
"Dreadful, avoid at all costs better going to a different hospital. Left my partner sitting in a&e with a severely broken wrist for four hours whilst she was visibly in pain",1
"On-site cash only paid parking is offered with the option of some on street parking nearby limited to 1 hour. Parking information hut near to the WHSmith shop and outpatients offers change. Hospital is clean with a reasonably modern feel to it and staff attentive. Cafe includes a Costa, £2.50 for a regular, light bites, sandwiches and a free cash point machine.",4
"Been waiting 10 months for my procedure after completeting the post procedure appointment.
I've tried calling and emailing and received nothing but silence the whole time.
The hospital itself is nice and friendly but this wait is not.",3
"Absolutely disgusting service on reception by a useless excuse of a human called Fazz! Acted with no understanding or compassion what so ever! If you see the name badge I'd wait to be seen by any one else but her, complete disgrace to the NHS service!",1
Nurses did their best but waited ages for pain relief (after surgery). No one helped me to leave after 'discharge' (I WAS  still carrying drainage bottle) the day following my op. .,2
Went into Good Hope last night at 7.30 for suspected pulmonary  embolism  by the time I was seen if I had a clot I would be dead.Seven hour wait to see the Dr.Informed by charge nurse 2 staff off and only two Dr's on for whole A/E and the CDU.The NHS is broken.They cannot cope and everyone is so fed up,1
Great staff do everything for you,5
Very nice staff pleasant helpful made me feel comfortable and care for xx,5
"Excellent service from all the nurses and doctors here, no wait time, the longest we waited was at reception while registering our details. So friendly and just nice.",5
"I've spent two days trying to establish which ward a next of kin is, I've spent hours on the phone, no one answers , they have no care or capacity to answer the phone, A &E are the only department that can tell you where your relative is, but are understandably busy so don't answer the phone, my relative has no phone,  not a good administration",1
Absolute joke. My son was turned away from A and E at midnight last night and told to go to his GP when he was coughing up blood and couldn't breathe. Still struggling this morning and obiously can't get through to the GP.,1
"I waited in a&e for 12 hours vomiting no stop and i let the nurses know and they just said take a seat and we will let the doctors know when i actually was seen i informed the doctors again and they said they wasn’t told anything, the a&e staff are extremely rude and disrespectful it’s honestly the worst especially when you are not feeling your best",1
"Review relates to Antenatal unit. Although staff very helpful, the waiting area is very poor. Water machines with no cups, messy seating area and an air of chaos. Room for a lot of improvement!",2
Day case unit staff absolutely fantastic. I am so impressed with the service and the professionalism used when dealing with a difficult patient.,5
Just spent the day in Good Hope GAU unit having a surgery and I can’t praise the staff enough. Every person I had contact with was absolutely amazing and so caring. Thanks you so much,5
Saturday morning my brother had a dislocated shoulder. Quick caring service with a follow up appointment next week. Great caring staff thank you.,5
"Worse hospital ever they don't give children proper treatment and rush you out because they don't want to see you I'm 10 and I'm writing a review got a broken nose and the told me to wait 10 days for heartlands hospital,They don't clean up the place went there yesterday and found cobwebs by the front desk I wouldn't recommend coming here ever went yesterday discussting place never go here",1
"Fothergill unit- triage, Sarah was brilliant tonight she was attentive and lovely to speak to wish all nhs were like her.",5
Came in for blood tests got the next appointment and have now had to wait over half an hour whilst the nurses have a long chat. Are they paid to keep people in the waiting room till we have to pay for parking?,1
My daughter was born earlier than what we expected and they took good care of my new born baby and my wife. Nice and polite nurses and staff. Thank you all.,5
What’s the point in getting a negative covid test to only be allowed in the room for a couple of minutes crammed behind a plastic screen in the corner. Surely you have a test so you can attend the appointment with your partner - Absolute shambles!,1
It is a horrible. My sister broke her leg in three places and they said it was just a sprain then phone up 4 days later telling us they got it wrong. Also made my friend wait  3 days after her water broke she got an infection also the baby had pooed in her she kept in touch with them telling them everything an they jst said u dont need to come in. lucky they both r alive. I would tell everyone to say away from this hospital,1
"Only look after white people here been sat waiting 1 hour 43 minutes after a rta struggling with my sight and hearing and have been moved from floor 1 back to ground to floor 1 to be told there no one tree me and I must wait
What about the 2 white males and the 2 white females that came after me check the cctv and records",1

Was in this hospital in April. I had covid19.the doctors nurses and all you hero's who worked them wards were amazing .thank God for our NHS  and I pray God will keep you all safe,5
"Very busy. At the same time, people were calm, kind, and professionally. I really appreciate it. Thank you! 🙂🙏😇❤️🤗",5
"You cant visit your sick relatives which we understand but you can't get through on the telephone to find out how they are.
I have spent the last two hours trying to phone. 18 phone calls later and I still can't get through.  Atrocious",1
"How dare they charge so much money for sick people to park
- daylight robbery. Shame  on you!  Parking has become a money making exercise.to penalise sick people who have no choice but to attend their appointments .",1
"Went to A&E for a foot injury yesterday morning.
I'm and out within the hour including xray.
Tracey in minors was excellent. Care and attention superb.",5
"Good hope a e department on nights, treated us disrespectfully. They did not answer the phone. They would not come out side to talk to me about my concerns about my daughter and granddaughter The hospital is a joke. I will not be going there again....",1
Wasnt feeling well and the doctor was speaking with me like im not welcome there. Very rude staff. Waste of tax money.,1
"Most staff are amazing and very helpful, some should take a leaf out of there book, people do not want to go to hospital for the sake of it, some people need compassion not rude staff that can't be bothered, on saying that my experience with good hope has been very helpful, the staff work very hard full marks, and thankyou,  keep up the good work..",4
"Appointment for 10.45, I make sure I was here with time to park. So far I have been waiting 75 minutes and no one tells you anything. Plus I am going to have to pay the higher rate of parking. ...what a joke!",2
"My father was called into the cardiology department because of concerning activity shown on his home pace maker monitor, picked up by the hospital itself.
He was left in A&E over nine hours waiting for a bed. He is 85. They requested him to be admitted !.
I could go on but in a word appalling.",1
"Literally saved my life!

They do their absolute best with what they have got but as we all know the NHS is still severally underfunded. We are lucky to have it, one of the best things about Britain.",5
Parking space and expense.  Building work by the Richard Salt unit. I had a long walk which really was painful due to waiting for  left and right hip replacement  but had a long walk.,3
"Worked there for 22 years always gave my best on wards and then clerical .
Then Husband admitted and then not impressed  2 wards and main  A&E certain Nurses and care assistants not caring enough lied about a lot if things have lost faith in that hospital through certain members of staff Let me down and rest if family cannot forgive",1
"disgusting sent to A&E by 111 for suspected meningitis, blood spots were appearing on my child before my eyes, got to Good Hope for a security guard to tell me it wasnt an emergency and to wait OUTSIDE for four hours NOT A NURSE OR A DOCTOR ....went to heartlands saw straight away everyone here absolutely great ..we think its purpura but i suppose the security guard could have told me that!!!!",1
"Nurses and consultants very helpful and easy to talk too , they listen to you properly instead of making you feel like your being rushed",5
Always late for every clinic. Have 8 patients for 1 time slot. As workers penalised for time of work and extra car park charges. Have appointments every 4 weeks and never on time in the 12 years I have attended.,1
I would like to thank Good Hope Hospital A&E team in the GP referral unit on Wed 10th June for the excellent care & support provided during a very busy shift.    John Mc,5
Great hospital really take care of you. Can't thank doctors and nurses enough they go beyove and beyond to help you. Thank you!!,5
The staff are friendly if you get perm staff but the food is absolutely disgusting no taste at all it's just terrible patients are getting food brought in for them including myself my husband brings in mine I'm a diabetic who should eat little and often but how can we if the food is absolutely disgusting it needs to be reviewed as patients are just not eating,1
"Admitted to CCU twice and cannot fault the ambulance service that took me to A&E on three occasions, the nurses and doctors in A&E who were both caring and compassionate, the staff in AMU and the brilliant staff on CCU and Ward 23. Brilliant service from everyone I came into contact with including all of the back office teams.",5

"Very long waiting hours but otherwise, staff is very helpful and friendly. Had to wait for more than 3 hours for very simple procedure. Would have preferred Heartlands but results was satisfactory anyway.",3
"I have a long history of Good Hope Hospital, firstly l worked for ""Langs,"" a building company as a labourer on the main entrance and  casualty ,then for ""Bryants""on the maternity unit, later during the winter periods l and many others came inside as porters just to combat the weather the pay was low but the working conditions along with working to help the sick was quite enjoyable; the main car park in the centre was at the time just a field and l distinctly remember discussing with my colleagues how it would be beneficial to have a multi-storey car park on that small field, to this day l am bewildered just why it has never materialised just think a central   car park with three floors one below ground, one at ground level and a top floor, with one way in and one way out...simple, this would then allow expansion of the hospital on the now parking areas.",4
"Good hope hospital is totally unbearable when it comes to patients,This hospital deserved no single star because yesterday i got an accident with my pregnant wife and emergency rush to GH hospital and they kept her waiting for over 4hrs without scanning either the baby was fine or not until we decide to leave with annoyance and ask us to sign self discharged paper.So pathetic.",1
"My Dad was taken to A and E

3days in ward 8 Richard Salt. Wonderful staff. Excellent treatment. Prompt and efficient. Everyone treated with dignity and respect. Thank you.,5
"Honestly it’s the worst, the staff are useless they don’t want to tell you anything and all they care about is freeing up beds. One of the main things they care about is making money out of people. The thing I hate most is the excuse staff use is “oh I can’t tell you I’ve only just come one shift”.",1
"Definitely No Hope,, try not to send your loved ones here if possible,,  the Last three times my mother has been In here its been a  nightmare,, she always ends up coming out worse than she went in,, these people are getting away with murder,, its like a prison,, ,,, most of the staff are very rude ,, even the social workers are useless,,, NOT SEND YOUR LOVED ONES HERE OR YOUR SELF IF POSSIBLE PLZ",1

Even though the A+E department was over run with people on trolleys  etc I can’t fault them . Thank you and I will never moan again about waiting times !,5
The appointment was shorter than my walk from the carpark to the department there's not enough disabled parking by A&E bring your own wheelchair as you're unlikely to find one.,2

They are struggling big time but staff is awesome. I have a lot of respect for people working there.,5
"My wife has just given birth at Good Hope. The support and decisions by the midwives, doctors and other people at Good Hope has been spot on.",5
Worst hospital ever the only good about this hospital was the midwives and a student training to be a nurse put me through hell in this hospital and traumatised me as well.,1
"This hospital is very deceitful and staff are extremely rood and uncooperative towards visitors, ward 7 is a ward ran by a so called matron that claims to also be the ward manager that would rather sit behind a desk chatting about her own personal life than attending to very poorly elderly people, in all the wards I unfortunately visited the only ward I can say is close to compatability is ward 25. In all a discusting place",1
"This is a fantastic hospital
They have looked after me, my wife, my children, my mother and now my father
The Nursing Staff are superb, second to none, despite being rushed off their feet and all of the Consultants brilliant

"Shocking!!! Over 8hrs waiting in a day room for an operation!!!!

"In one word, TRAGEDY'' My son seriously injured his leg when he was 7 years old. Wardrobes were put on. The incompetence of the staff and waiting for who knows what drove us crazy. No screen covering the procedure, they asked 5 times if he was allergic to anything, yes he was to penicillin! And what do antibiotics and penicillin give? The anesthesia was administered incorrectly, my son was crying and screaming in pain and asked to stop because it hurt. And there was no nurse to calm me down, everything would be fine soon. By the way, they boast that they have operating rooms and where he was operated on right next to the waiting room where other children could hear him crying and screaming, quite a trauma for other children. A week before commonwealth games 2022, this is what is happening in a hospital that should be prepared for everything but is not. I saw with my own eyes how the cleaning crew cleaned the floor and doors with the same mop. This is how you clean the doors in this hospital with a mop. I do not recommend this hospital to anyone.",1
"I had a CT scan today and I’m pleased for the helpful nurses and team work. They so professional and quick to do the appointments.
No long queue, I come a bit early from my appointment time.
There is good waiting area for patients, toilets and accessible toilet available in the waiting area.
Vendors available out side the MRI & CT Scan Department, just in the main entrance of City Hospital.
I been told, City Hospital will move to the new hospital Midland Metropolitan University Hospital by the end of October or early November this year 2024.",5
"I took my 6 yr old boy to the Paediatric Assessment Unit on advice from 111. The unit is sperate from the main A&E and provided a nice space suitable for children. All the staff were friendly, approachable and kind. It seemed very efficient and we didn't wait long to be seen. My son was admitted to the small ward of 5 beds, it was clean and nicely decorated to suit children. Again the staff that looked after my son were amazing, they were kind, thoughtful and clearly very hard working. Thank you :)",5
The mixed raced woman at the little restaurant is rude you ask her what something is and she has an attitude you do not treat patients like that nobody wants stink face and rude attitude when being served i didn't even get anything i just walked off in the end because i’m not spending my money with rude people i dont know what kind of ghetto people you have working here but she is not professional at all get her off please nexxxt!!!!! Anyway the rest of the staff in the hospital we well nice and i have noticed waiting time getting quicker,2
"Having my first babe in this hospital and it is beyond the worst experience I have ever had.

They leave you waiting for 5 plus house to see a doctor, with the room that hot it is unbearable no water is offered for you.

There is no communication what so ever regarding what is happing it’s just a general terrible experience with this hospital and I wouldn’t recommend anyone having a baby here let alone your first baby.",1
I had a MRI scan here today. All the staff were helpful and understanding when I explained I had concerns about the scanner. Even the lady who gave me directions to the unit was charming.they deserve nothing but praise.,5
"An absolute joke. 11 month old daughter waited 4 hours to see a doctor with temperature of 39.4 at the paediatrics emergency department and we were told that children are not a priority unless it’s an emergency. I’m pretty sure being on the brink of a seizure is an emergency. Nurse did not adhere to infection control when taking observations. Looked at me like I shouldn’t have been there, no compassion whatsoever.",1
"Currently here to visit the children's emergency care unit with my 5 month old daughter.
We have been here for almost 3 hours even though they state the wait time is only 2 hours and they don't seem to prioritise patients in order of age at all.
They also enforce a one parent per child rule even though there is plenty of space so I'm having to wait out in the corridor which absolutely reeks of urine, with nowhere to sit because homeless and drunk people are laying across all of the chairs - I can understand enforcing this rule when it's busy but not when there are plenty of seats available within the CECU.",1
"This hospital was an amazing experience for me! Staff were helpful and I was fine after they took care of me, which only took a few hours, which is fast for how hard it was.",5
"I went here 02:30am about chest pains on the right . I was seen by the nurse then my ecg done then my bloods taken for testing . I sat there then at 08:30 I was told I would need to go upstairs and I be seen within 2 hours because they need to do another blood test and wait for results I wasn’t happy but I said okay .when me and few bunch of us got upstairs , we were told the specialist is arriving 12:00pm and the junior can’t make any decisions . I told them I been here since 02:30 and I have night shift but they couldn’t care less. After flogging us around I was seen at 13:30 to be told I have no issue . 11 hours in hospital is ridiculous. Instead of going to this hospital , you best to just die at home",1
"The staff on ward D25 where kind professional and very caring from the domestic staff to the nurses , the wonderful anesetic guys and surgeons  and everyone in between. Excellent care at this hospital from the initial consultation until i was discharged. The Gynaecological team could not have been any better.
The ward was spotlessly clean also.",5
"On Tuesday, I waited in a&e after being inappropriately triaged by a&e receptionists when I called 999 and said I am on my way after a head trauma. The consultant was grumpy and could not care at all than about NHS costs and saying to go private for a full MOT when I asked for the bare minimum. It stunk so badly in the toilets.

I’m someone who hates needles and hospitals. The staff especially reception need to be adequately trained. I had to fight with the hospital for my full records, I asked daily and was denied this and told they have till 19th Dec. I said with a head injury, you want me to wait a month for my medical records. The consultant wrote false clinical notes and did not do the measurements she claimed to do.
The HCA, Jenny was ever so lovely and kept me calm. It’s stressful going to A&E, but this was by far my worst treatment I had by the NHS. Jenny was the only one who truly understood me, and Amy - one of the lovely staff members who helped triage me.

The nurses were just trying to do their jobs. The consultant couldn’t care less if my arm was hanging off, she definitely wasn’t showing signs of equality and being attentive towards diversity. Her lack of empathy and communication puts questions into her practice truthfully.",2
"Absolutely horrendous place, NHS should be ashamed to have these as part of their team. Went at 2:30AM to be ignored by the receptionist, not so much as a hello. To then not get seen for an ECG until 5:30, then to wait for an XRAY til 9AM and still waiting at 9:30AM now to get any kind of result to find out what’s going on. The staff are so rude, to have a “nurse” practically rag my arms down because I’ve never had an XRAY before (could’ve asked instead of assuming” is atrocious. I hope I never ever ever have to step foot in this place again. I’d rather suffer.",1
"Visiting the A/E Eye clinic with my wife who had been sent by her doctor. Though there was a queue at the reception she was dealt with quite quickly before going on to see a triage nurse before being passed on for further observation. Given the number of people waiting to be seen and that it was Bank Holiday Monday, waiting time and dismissal totaled five hours. The only complaint was the offhand attitude of the doctor who attended to my wife .!!!",4
"Avoid this hospital at all costs.
My fiance went here and we was told a 6 hour wait in A and E times they got his name wrong I  his tag so they couldn't at first locate him on the system  previous  mediacaal notes . The wait went up to 8 hours than  10 hours.  We was there 14  hours on total.

The toilets are  disgusting.  There was sick on the waiting room floor
I reported it at 9 . No one cleaned it until 8am .

Staff only  called patients once  in the waiting area if you miss your name you have to knock the door and staff were rude about it.yet down the bottom of the corridor  you just cant hear what name was  called .

My fiance had to wait for a ct scan but the stupid nurse injected the dye wrong so it would of gone into a muscle not the vein.  The staff dont have a clue what the are doing its disgraceful . He had to have it  redone and wait   hour's  for one. His still  waiting  now.  They haven't given him his medication  and had to wait from 9am. It's now 8pm  . Its not  on.

One staff was very rude to me when I walked  Into  the room said so who are you . I said I'm  my fiances care giver and his  partner but she went oh who do you work for? Meaning company I said I don't  I work as a live in care giver and she said rudely so what do you do. I told her and she went oh . instead of saying aww how nice  yer she was very nice to everyone else entering the room  why?I  was polite to her.",1
"This hospital doesn't even answer phone calls anymore. I've called main reception and the woman didn't want to even talk to me, like didn't want to even say hello or ask for NHS number, nothing..eventually said I don't know and put me on hold and then cut the line. I've tried cAlling 3 times , every time they cut the phone call and no one bothered to answer. Who do you employ there? This is horrendous!",1
"I accompanied my daughter to city hospital. It was as if I was watching a comical drama. A& E was in undated with patients. There were more police on the floor babysitting man babies who cant be -have themselves, all at the cost of the taxpayers. Kick them into booth camp or the army. The handful of nurses, Doctors and care staff working  so diligently in trying to do their best in caring. I saw one nurse still eating her lunch while's taking a patient to the toilet. Six ambulances on the fore court with patients on board waiting to be seen. For those reading this, please go easy on these dedicated staff, they are doing their best working in a hospital that is literally fragmented. The NHS is Dead.",4
"Staff are absolutely a joke! How can they be laughing when I told her my mother might be having a stroke which a walk in doctor has told us! Reception staff just start bursting out laughing it’s impossible! I didn’t know your reception staff are trained medics! Absolutely vile staff wouldn’t allow me to go in with my mother! Absolutely useless send a letter for a scan 6 months later!!! Til today she is sick what have you done apart from mishandling my mother at ur facility, even the nurses don’t know how to take blood sample from ur upper arm, all patient blood drawn from the veins on ur hand! Every bloody patient every race has a plaster on their hand! Why are the nurses so rude and the doctors! I have never in my life seen a hospital like this! I can’t believe the nurses and staff you have there! I will report you to health commission! You should be shut down! This isn’t a hospital is a zoo circus!",1
"Great facilities from start to end. At the Enterance the security guard checks your appointment letter.  Then guides you where to go.  After entering your hands are sanitised and you are givin a new face mask.  You have to wear one even if you are wearing your own. Then you go to a self check in counter and mark your attendance through the bar code on apt letter and few details about yourself. Then you are guided by the staff to concerned department. You wait in the waiting area for your turn.  Chairs in waiting area are kept 2 meters apart. First a nurse takes you to check temprature and height and BP etc. Later you are called to be checked by Doctor. Throughout guidance and SOPs strictly followed.  Well done

Recently i went for a walk in covid vaccine. The building is easy to find and has no direction from the main hospital entrance and i had to walk here and there to reach it. Anyway, one i got there it was all great. From start to end every single step was guided and explained properly and i was given my Jab with full prior and post instructions.
The finding part was only diffucult so the pictures i have added are for the covid jab walk in center. Was open toll 6pm on Saturday, thts the best part.
In short, you go on the back of the main hospital entrance building and walk straight towards the car parks. Cross both car parks and you will see a new building Constitution, cross that building and you will see the signs following the area. The picture with green and yellow bins is the place for Jabs.",5
"I'm giving 3 stars because some staff are amazing and some not. We were in the maternity department and some of the midwifes think they own the place. Some of them show no interest whatsoever and you can clearly see by their faces that they do not care or want to even work there. Re-training is highly needed for the following to individuals- Charlene and Pam. There is also a midwife/shift co-ordinator in the reception, young, wears eye lashes that has a serious attitude problem. The rest of them are good. Tbh it's predominantly the black women with the most careless attitude and really do not want to be there. I'm just stating my experience which is the obvious when you visit there. Hopefully you won't!",3
I would love to express my huge gratefullness to d-r Rashid from A&E at City Hospital in Birmingham. He was exceptional! A big thank you to  all the staff as well!💜,5
"Months trying to get an appointment for a potentially serious dermatological issue. An hour before my appointment they sent me a poorly presented text telling me it was cancelled because the doctor hadn’t turned up. This is midweek at 9am, I had booked time off work and queued in traffic for no reason and I’m now back to square one.",1
Can take a while to be seen but staff try there best hospitals always trust to help people best they can even with travel expenses in some cases this hospital does have to deal with some of the worst patients imaginable plus people from the hmp prison around the corner but its so much better then the reviews that Karen's are giving it's free and saves lives be grateful it's there,4
"Attended the Orthopedic clinic, saw Dr Veettil, would like to thank him and the Nurses for their care and kindness during my consultation, truly awesome people.!!!",5
"Racist. As soon as i come in with my child and said my child had food poisoning Janice rudely asked me why did I bother coming in and I tried to keep the conversation calm because my child was sick but she kept threatening to bring police in. After, a white child came in and they were given care before my child was given. I then asked If i could speak with the manager because i wanted to know when we would get medical attention and she said okay but then she sent the police to question me instead.",1
"What can I say about this place? I know it's a hospital but the people are absolutely depressing but that could just be because it's Birmingham. The parking situation of a morning is absolutely horrendous, almost no existent and having to avoid potholes everywhere",2
"Atrocious staff. I had been rushed over by ambulance over suicide reasons
they told me they'd get me help in the psych asap
i was sat in the waiting room
I found out that it was a TWELVE HOUR wait just for someone to speak with me
how do they expect that?
it's not their fault entirely as I know NHS are under staffed
I'm absolutely appalled so I got up and left in the dodgiest area in Birmingham with no way of getting home",1
"Bad experience I went to ent department. Doctor was very rude . He didn’t explain me properly my problem and even didn’t explain solution. I waiting from long time , struggling with the breathing problem due to nasal blockage. Looks like doctor don’t want do anything.",1
Was sent Here by 111 so My 11 Year old could be seen the positive we got seen straight negatives it was 9 miles away from where I live and I don't drive so it cost an arm and a leg. When we entered the Accident and Emergency it was busy with all sorts of walks of life some quite intoxicated. It was really quite run down and in desperate need of of repair the lady's toilets were disgusting full of toilet paper and God knows what they couldn't be used I don't think they had been cleaned for 100 years luckily some kind patients directed us to a toilet that was cleaner and useable The appointment it self felt rushed and I didn't really get any answers to why my child was crying in  pain and had a fever. I don't think I would want to come here again.,1
i would just like to say a big thank you to all the staff on D25.i went on day unit today to have fibroid removed and the staff were so welcoming.i felt so nervous this morning and they all made me feel at ease.they all work do hard.keep up the good work everyone you are all stars xx special thanks to student nurse matt who.was brill.u.gonna make a brill nurse.xx,5
I went to the hospital in England for the first time in 3 years. I have been itching for a long time and can't sleep at night. I waited for 5 hours and then my turn did not come. Why they charged nhs fees when treatment is not given?world worst health service 😡😡,1
"Terrible service. Only some staff are good, otherwise there are extremely rude staff as well as young staff which are inexperienced.   I was pregnant and had a c section. Obviously after I give birth, they have me a plaster on my stitch but they took it off on the first day I gave birth instead of the usual 5 days. My plaster IS meant to be taken off after 5 days. Not only this, they took my plaster off before showering. This has caused me severe infection and stomach swelling. Obviously even though the midwives supposedly have years of experience they don’t know basic knowledge that water can infect cuts? Let alone on the first day I gave birth with no plaster and fresh stitches? Even my daughter who goes to school knows this. My experience here was absolutely horrible and a disgrace. I wouldn’t recommend ANY pregnant women going here. Hopefully in the future, this problem will be fixed otherwise this hospital will be garbage forever.",1
"I’d give it zero stars if I could! I can NEVER EVER expected this “care” from here… My mom (73 years of age and BED BOUND!) was taken to this joke of a hospital yesterday (30/07/2023) and was later discharged back home with a follow up appointment at a later date.
The discharge team did not alert me as her NOK or the carers that she had been discharged so consequently my poor mother was lying in bed for almost 24 hrs in her house with NO FOOD, OR NO PHONE TO CALL ANYONE because the dopey patient transport left her bags the otherside of the room!! A TOTAL NEGLECT OF HER CARE NEEDS AND HER AGE! utterly disgraceful…. If this is patient care then I’ll be glad when the NHS is privatised because then we may get good care!",1
"It's a nightmare

What is happening in this place is beyond human comprehension.  They took my wife, brought her with a child, forbade me to do ""cimcirimci"" for some time.  But that's okay, I had no problem with that.  However, the WORST thing is that they gave us a fickle child, he screams as if he was being skinned, curious, sticks his fingers everywhere.  My life has been hell for the last 10 months.  They refused to exchange us for others.  All my rights and personal space have been violated!  I will never set foot there again!!!",3
"It's a very good place for your booking for antenatal and post natal because of their level of professionalism of the doctors and midwife.
I will recommend them any day",4
I HAD NO PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY. The nurse on duty NADINE exposed to the whole part of the majors unit that I have something in particular. This is against my confidentiality to speak so open. Will be reported. Disgusting,1
Not sure why it is called A+E unit if a patient has to wait minimum 5-6hrs just to get the initial service. Few of the staffs are nice and well behaved but few are really rude and very reluctant no matter how emergency situation it could be.,1
"Was so glad to go home. Was advised to go as people were getting so concerned I was becoming too ill. The nurses, x-ray department, porters, CT  are lovely, fantastic beside manners, can't fault them, like your best friend, very patient, encouraged to ask questions if any concerns, if you feel something is not right get it checked out no matter what.

The doctor had such a poor bedside manner, was told off and called a liar in ear view of the ward, no info was passed to me about what was wrong until I went to the hospital, although it wasn't what they presumed it was still a huge problem. I hate writing bad reviews but after a short stay in hospital was complained at and had to put my foot down with 3 there.

Left with a new problem. Now on strong anti biotics for a bad skin infection.",1
No issues to speak of on this visit.  It was easy to get a parking space which can be an issue.,4
Terrible staff!! Would not recommend going to this hospital. Teenage nurses who are inexperienced. Leaving u for hours just saying the same things over  and over again. Didn't treat my dad very well he had all sorts of infections just left him to get worser they shipped him of out of this hospital and then he was blue lighted to another hospital WHAT A  ABSOLUTE JOKE!! ( would not recommend )!,1
Understaffed and horrible. Not enough seats and even if you get one they are all metal. The floor is more comfortable. After 6 hours on them you need to see a doctor for your bum,1
"This hospital saved the life of my wife. Very impressed from start to finish of what is an extremely stretched NHS and under-aid workforce. Very happy and wouldn’t dare complain. Parking is a total night,are as is with most hospitals. But the quality of care received is great. The monument outside is pretty impressive too. All in all very pleased and would recommend others.",5
"I came here to the A&E department after being dismissed several times by another hospital. I came in with severe back & abdomen pain and was seen promptly by the triage nurse. Everyone was so friendly and lovely and genuinely cared (unlike the other hospital). After being told by another doctor at the other hospital that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my kidneys & refusing me a scan and just sending me home with morphine, I came back to this hospital as I was sure there was something wrong and was given a scan straight away. Low & behold it came back with 6 kidney stones and I was referred by a lovely doctor to the stone clinic at their sister hospital Sandwell. I am just so thankful to this hospital for actually listening to me and genuinely caring. Now I finally have answers and am on the waiting list for treatment. Thank you so so much City Hospital! 😊",5
"The best thing about this hospital is the carpark, no matter what section of the hospital you have to get to, there is only 1 massive carpark. Unlike other hospitals like city hospital. The car park is horrendous",5
"I went to visit my Dad who had just been diagnosed with terminal cancer  and was horrified to hear two nurses threatening to throw a bucket of water over him if he didn't sit up and do as he was told. They tried to ignore me when I confronted them, one even pushing past me and tutting. My Dad was actually crying and begging me to take him home. To be told that you're dying and then treated like this is unforgivable.",1
"Although it looked understaffed, the reception and consultation was absolutely brilliant. Most of the staffers seem friendly and helpful.",5
"On 22/06/2023
I was sent to A&E , Dudley road hospital with a doctor’s letter/referral
I checked in the reception at about 11.15
Then the drama started, after sitting in the waiting room 3 hours, I was then called for an interview and to to sit in the waiting room again, there I sat for another 2hour . I was then taken in for a MOT ( that’s what the nurse told me ) blood test / blood pressure etc . I was then taken for an xray. After that I was put back in the waiting room again , this time for another 2 hours.
I am an 84 year man and had bad foot injury, tossed around in various room sitting on these metel chairs for around 6 hours or more.
This lengthy wait made my injury even worst , I returned home in much more pain than I went in.
My name is
Zahid hasan . 32 Cuthbert Road
B18 4AG .date of birth 20/11/1938 . I am registrared with Dr Abrol surgery on city road . Birmingham.
I found this experience very unsatisfactory, very poor state of affairs.
I want put a serious complaint in and may also claim compensation.
Please check the hospital records of my visit and confirm the facts .",1
"Excellent hospital.
Excellent A&E dept but can get busy at times.
Plenty of parking if visiting and price is ok to.
Outlets selling food and hot and cold drinks.
Great bus links and tram just a few streets away to city centre or into black country towns.",5
Very poor staff memebers who do not know how to care for their patients properly and they only for a raise of money . Also they leave you waiting for hours and hours instead of actually treating their patients . Talk about leave someone on their death bed and yet these people call them self nurses . I do not recommend going to a this hospital at all if you need medical help,1
"Terrible hospital, clueless doctors within maternity ward causing delay on discharge of new born. Avoid. Give birth somewhere else",1
"Outstanding and excellent care given to my mother. Amazing doctors, nurses and all the staff who work there. Wonderful people! Truly gifted and talented! Cannot praise them enough for how they treated my unwell mother and for that I'm grateful!

Any issues people have are entirely government related not staff. The health service workers majority care and want to help, lack of funds, progression and red tape stop that. Blame the government for your low rating not the amazing people who work in such hard conditions. I for one thank them immensely.",5
My views are biased as I was born here but it’s a big hospital with all emergency and hospital Adhoc services,5
My Auntie was taken into City Hospital suffering with chest pains. The doctors and nurses here are exceptional. My Auntie was looked after so well and with such kindness and compassion. Every member of staff from car park assistant to doctor was so helpful.,5
Absolutely impossible to book blood tests or appointments of any kind through their rude customer service,1
Worst hospital in the country my week old child was not well 111 gave me appointment to see docter when I arrived at A&E receptionist was very very rude she was like you don’t have any appointments wait here for 6 hours I was just not sure where to go she was not helpful at all and not first Time I had very bad experience at this hospital West Brom and Walsall much better than this I will never go back to this hospital again definitely staff here don’t deserve to work for nhs,1
"Hospital staff don't want to help you at all
Came here with my wife because she's pregnant and she's bleeding and we been waiting here for 4 hours and still didn't even checked her out.

I understand that there patience that probably need help earlier but I think 4 hour just to see her is a bit too much

The hospital is huge but it seems like they have only 10 doctors on site",1
"I went in to check my knee as was painful for couple of days and couldn’t see improvements. Was seen straight away by Nick who was very friendly and helpful taking me to the X-ray and seeing me as soon as done with the X-ray. Was really good at explaining me what it was and what to do to feel better! Also referred me to a specialist to reassured me that I should be fine.
Thanks again and appreciate your help!",5
Came in with a face injury on the ambulance and was seen very quickly. Staff were efficient and very caring. They stitched my face very well and were very thorough. I was very impressed with everything and considering the bad press the a and e services get I was so pleased and surprised. They did a fantastic job and all staff really wonderful.,5
"Mri machine has been broken for 6 months and they will not fix it.
Hospital itself needs a deep clean. Not sanitary at all. Felt disgusting when sitting on the chairs in waiting area.
Council needs to get on this ASAP.
No issues with the staff though. Very friendly and caring.",2
"For the nurses on D17.
You looked after my mom Christina who passed during the early hours on the 29th April.
I'm sorry that I can't remember your names, but I wanted you to know my mom always praised you and was thankful for your help, care, chats and patience.",5
"Came to City hospital after a referral from my dentist.
The staff in oral surgery department were very friendly, professional and caring.
Clean and relaxed environment that helped the procedure go smoothly.
Many thanks",5
Very busy but got you in and out realy quick,5
"I never got a letter to say I’ve got an appointment and the location of the appointment, I only got a text message and I had to call to ask which branch it was, I went to the hospital and no information desk or anything, I asked random person who took me somewhere and that was not where I was suppose to be. I had to leave and walk fast and finally found it but I was 10 min late. Then they said I’ve to wait 1 hour because I was 10 min late.. how do u want me to know where I should be as a person who never been to the hospital. This is ridiculous and bad service.",1
"Old hospital, building in need of repair. New hospital to replace this one next year Midlands metropolitan. Staff are very friendly",5
Had my baby here in 2019. Wouldn't wish it on anybody! They didnt listen to me at all. Luckily baby arrived safely. All ok.,1
"Absolutely disgusting hospital. Arrived at 2.30am, was quoted a 5h wait time initially which became 6h, then 7h and I am still waiting. Was told at 7am that there were 3-4 people ahead of me, only to go back after an hour and being told there are another 5 people ahead of me. Staff have no compassion. I have been begging for medicine for the last hour but keep being sent away. Latest update is that now the hospital’s GP will be seeing me instead, they open at 9am. So another lovely long wait at the GP now, starting the queue from zero. All this while I wasn’t allowed to go home at any point, way to make a sick person sicker. Disgraceful and disgusting.",1
"Went to the A&E walk in yesterday. Was seen within the hour by Triage and out straight into a bed because my heart rate was so high and wouldn’t drop. Staff were very efficient and friendly, did all the necessary tests, struggled to take blood because my veins don’t like to come to the surface, but they still persevered. From start to finish I was there for around 6 hours.",5
Have you seen hospitals in horror movies where the Zombie apocalypse. Well that's what you see in the Emergency part of this hospital. Everything is falling apart. Nurses are loud and unattentive. Sits had massive tears on the cushions like they've just admitted a wolverine a whole mess of an Emergency room. I asked for a blanket and there was two lumps of dried up something still sticking to it. I asked for an other one and it had two massive dried blood stains. All and all was not a good experience.,2
"I went to the hospital, the treatment was very bad. I came in an emergency, so they would not receive me and supervise me. I waited 6 hours and someone came who works in maintenance. They told me that he is a doctor. Now he told me that I cannot do anything. Is this fair in Queen Elizabeth Hospital?",1
"for the first time in the hospital, I was well received.

They responded to my requests.

I had to wait my turn which is normal and I even found that it was quite fast in my case I think I've come across a good team.",5
I was very appalled  on A&E where I stayed for a few days  and then moved to another ward you . Got kids who try to be nurses  who have got bad attitude problems  and treat the public  who are sick like children  I am realy disgusted . But ward 11 lovely  staff. Show you respect.  And very helpful .,2
"In 2021 i ran to this hospital as i was miscarriaging , full of blood on my dress and no body cared also i was in so much pain and they didn’t care at all , made me wait 4 hours outside and not seen onces while waiting for doctor . Worse day of my life what i have experienced at this hospital.",1
Have never had a bad experience at city. From dog bitten back sides to giving birth to both of my children here. Nurses and Drs are always ran off their feet and always give as much care and concern as they can. My children when having to go to children's A&E are always treated fantastically too!,5
The children's hospital is fantastic. The care that my children have received in the A&E department has always been amazing. The children have always been seen too quickly when attending. I wouldn't take them anywhere else,5
Went for my wife pregnancy scan at ward d21 the staff treat her like animals so please avoid scans here staff was so rude I wish I can give 0 stars,1
"Dated hospital, would benefit from a refurb throughout. Staff are generally friendly and supportive.

The car park remains free on my recent visit on 30/07/20.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Car park park is NOT free anymore as of 16/10/20.  Though you can remain for free for upto 15mins only.

And the Gastrointestinal Department (Endoscopy) staff are awesome.",4
Went to the breast clinic with my young daughter as she found a lump .Went to support her and staff member was very rude wouldn't even let me in .daughter was very scared and worried .,1
"Some nurses were helpful but I sustained a knee injury and was holding in a wee for 7 hours and was unable to physically go to the toilet, I asked a few times for a bed pan and after finally receiving it I was told I was being ""demanding"" by a nurse.... I was holding in the pee for a long time so as to not inconvenience anyone only to be told I was being demanding. After complaining to the sister nurse she had no sympathy and no concern and agreed that I was being difficult ?? Previously said nurse was sitting around on her phone when co workers were busy doing other things too honestly have never experienced such rudeness at this hospital",1
Absolutely disgusted by the level of service you get from the staff!!! Unprofessional need training 100% cut you off when awaiting,1
"Terrible service, called to enquire about a family member. The operator at the reception was very rude. I asked her politely to check to see if my uncle has been admitted to the hospital. She spoke over me saying “ she knows how to spell the name” and she hung up the phone with a sarcastic “ok”! The receptionist needs more training and fix up her attitude.",1
In pain never to be heard ste back queue with no signs everyone wondering when there turn.,1
Very lazy staff. Poor service. My friend went in needed medical attention and was told to wait a time when it was such an easy fix. Do better people rely on you.,1
"I would advise everyone to stay away from this hospital. My partner went in whilst pregnant after bleeding and being in considerable pain and very concerned. Staff at the reception was threatening and laughing at me about my current situation, told me to sit down or go home after waiting for 9 hours!! People who had been waiting hours were being called in and then told they have to wait another’s few hours just to be spoken to. No staff were concerned for anybody’s wellbeing and were very rude to most of the patients there.
Please stay away from this hospital and File a complaint as it is unacceptable.",1
"Had 3 kids here and a great experience with maternity staff 🤱🏾but in recent times have noticed patients seated queuing for A&E! 🏥🚑

Often traffic delays around Dudley Road through ongoing roadworks and hospital development 🚧(although I feel the new site near Cape Hill will cause similar problems at the Smethwick end!🚦)

Major respect for ALL NHS workers ⚕️and hope their strike action ensures the government are pressured into giving them the pay increases they truly deserve! 💖",4
"Terrible experience. No empathy or compassion during a difficult time.left me in a waiting room for over an hour with no updates. When I asked for advice she didn't help. I ended up getting help through a different hospital, 111 and private charity. Only good thing was the sonographer and assistant , I would give her 5 stars.",2
"I’m not very happy had an appointment for trauma & orthopaedic and my appointment what an actually for Sandwell hospital. Luckily I had a lift. I had an appointment on the 24th of January this year Same letter as last time so went to Sandwell hospital. This time I didn’t have a lift and was told I have to be at city Hospital which there was no chance of being there on time. I have since been discharged as I did not show up for my appointment. The secretary at Sandwell hospital called to make sure I was supposed to be at that city hospital. This cool was not recorded or sent to trauma and orthopaedics. I was told by the secretary at somewhere hospital, they would send me a new appointment through. They haven’t. They have discharge me from the hospital. When there are two hospitals, Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals, they should change their letter heading to make it easier for patients to know which hospital they are going to, and not have to stress if they are at the wrong hospital.",3
"The receptionists are too rude. Like seriously who gives attitude towards patients that are here for help because they're unwell?! They're meant to be professionals but I was disgusted at the rudeness of the customer service provided by these receptionists. As someone who works in customer service myself and understand the requirements needed to provide a high level of customer care, I was not impressed at all. A HOSPITAL of all places is where you would expect to receive compassion and understanding. This was definitely not the case!!",1
I have had the worst experience here in this hospital staff deserve to get punched in the face for how rude they are on top you buzz the door clearly 20 staff inside chilling having a laugh while you waiting to get buzzed inside racist they discriminate us foreigners you could be dying they walk past you with no bother ive seen patients pass out from pain sleepin on the floor waiting to get helped while the staff are chilling getting paid to sit there and watch patients suffer i do not recommend this hospital to anybody young or old your best of going to another hospital you will regret coming here trust me your no good comin here to suffer only someone has to say it and i am this hospital should be demolished years ago,1
"I used to stay up all night working for a long time, and then one day, I started to experience irregular, rapid heart beats at night, dizziness and pain of blood vessels in hand, with also tingling pains in my chest.

So, I was referred to the hospital for an ECG, when the ECG results came back, (the doctor/nurse) said my report showed that my heart was fine. At the same time, she questioned why I felt pain and did not take Paracetamol. She sneered at me and said you should know that this is not a heart problem, but a muscle pain, you should take Paracetamol directly when you have the pains and do not listen to GP's advice to come here.

I felt her disdain for me, but I'm not a doctor. How do I diagnose myself? I just talked to my GP about the symptoms I was experiencing, then he sent me for a diagnosis.

During that time, I was under great pressure to study, but I still took time to go to the hospital because I'm worried that my health.

I was afraid of using paracetamol to mask chest pain and other problems without knowing what was happening.

I didn't expect that the staff could be so unprofessional and talk so irresponsibly.",1
"I'm a healthy and fit 37 yr old who has had numerous visits here over the past few decades mainly due to sporting incidents or really Ill times eg. Gastroenteritis, glandular fever etc.

I have always been very well looked after and genuinely think waiting times have improved since I was a child.

Tonight was for a potential nose break to which Kirsty from the EMT had helped me with. She was professional, friendly and caring while treating me and checking over any other potential I juries to the head with the impact I suffered to the nose.

So this is a big thumbs up for always looking after me well City Road Hospital. Your efforts are sincerely appreciated",5
Great vaccine team here! I was very scared so they reassured me and the vaccine was pretty much painless. Good work.,4
"Amazing work experience.
My sister gave birth there, and I can not thank enough for doctor Albert Demitri
midwife’s, mrs Cyndia , mrs Magdalena , doctor Thomas Chapman for his very best way to comfort his patients, and all the staff who did the best, trying to be helpful and patient and supportive.
Big thanks for all.",5
"The staff, nurses, doctors and consultants of ward D17 could not have done more for my sister. Thank you to all for the professional, caring and genuine affection and support you gave my sister in her long battle.",5
"Went to a&e, was told to call 999 but with everything that was happening, I didn’t want to take up an ambulance due to someone needing it more than me. I had taken my mum that is my registered carer with me as i get severe panic attacks. I told her I can’t talk to her, I need my mum. I told her I think I’m having a miscarriage. This was the same woman that had said unless people had respiratory problems everyone can wait. This was when I suffered a miscarriage last time. I had a panic attack outside the hospital and no one cared. She was rude and didn’t care about the well-being of me or my baby or the after affect it had on me. I felt like I they didn’t care at all. If anyone suffers with mental health, talking to someone is already hard enough. They say go in to a&e if you feel unsafe with mental health…. Just to make you feel even worse. Rude staff registering people in a&e and inconsiderate. This was a horrible experience",1
"I've never known a hospital as bad as this one. The staff refused to give me my medication that I'm prescribed and take daily plus its a controlled drug  (I'm a cancer patient ) when you're in hospital your suppose to be comfortable out of pain.  I had to walk out the ward I was on not one member of staff asked if I was OK when I cried nearly most of the day,  I got treated terrible.  I was told I'm dying when I said I'm leaving.  If I'm dying why make me feel in pain why not make me comfortable!  I've made a complaint",1
"I had treatment at the Breast clinic.
It was superb and I couldn't have asked for more.
I was very worried about treatment but I need not have been. I was treated with respect, professionalism and huge amounts of kindness.  I couldn't have been treated better.",5
After attending the surgical day unit today I can honestly say from the time I arrived to the time I left I couldn't have had better treatment. All the staff were lovely and caring  my comfort and well being was important to them. Wonderful people,5
"Prioritised severity of injury well and saw me in good time when considering what I was there with, nurses were friendly and very well trained and treatment was effective, thanks to all there who do their job so enthusiastically :D",5
My elderly mum (83yrs) had a 12:00 appointment for a cataract op. She was made to wait for 4hrs for the op. She didn't leave the hospital till 5pm. Why bother giving timed appointments if you can't stick to the timing.,1
Doctors in the A&E really go out of their way. They're kind and professional and doing the absolute best they can,5
The A&E department was smelling made me feel sick when I walked in and the floors where dirty and the toilets disgusting. Staff was nice.,3
"I came here recently for an out patient appointment. I have been having a few problems so this is why I was sent here. Anyway, I was issued an appointment with Mr manickam vairavan he is rude and intimidating to the point I had to get up from what he was doing and leave. If you think by using a problem that I suffer with as an excuse for not doing anything else go a head but I won't be leaving this. You are messing with the wrong person.",1
"Staff are ok, here. If you are polite and listen carefully. Its probably best to have some kind of appointment, even if you're just visiting A&E. (I was booked in to A&E by a nurse on 111 phone service). Get there early. There are two confusing entrances at front. Red is for emergency entry, Blue is for ""walk in"" A&E. There is a useful hospital map by red emergency door, too. Outside, I was approached by a sneaky beggar girl, asking for ""change"". (she was pretending to walk into the hospital). This isn't the fault of the hospital, i did not have time to report her to security. (last thing you want is to be hassled for money if you're carrying an injury): Inside, if you make it past security guy, there are two confusing ""waiting areas"" (but nurse at front desk popped up as I was trying to find ""second area"" and directed me correctly). (""second waiting area"" is actually down a corridor, past main entrance, then down a second corridor) 1 to 2 hours is stated as waiting time to be seen... Be patient, I was impressed I only had to wait half an hour. Clinician I seen gave me proper painkillers and (seems) to have diagnosed leg injury correctly.. Receptionist also helped me with ""attendance letter"" so I can prove I've got a genuine health condition preventing me from working. (thanks to all concerned) support your NHS.",4
"Took mother in law who is 86 yrs old and not very steady on her feet to this hospital for an appointment in Sheldon block, which we found with great difficulty. No signage to direct you to the parking area or to where Sheldon block is, we had to walk a fair way over rough ground this needs addressing asap please",3
"Thank you! From the door to the nurses, to the doctors and the treatment, I am very pleased with the service. Workers there were nice and polite. It made me feel less stressful about my emergency situation. In general I spent there around 5hours and I think it is absolutely good time in consideration with all checkups and local anaesthesia surgery. They fixed my problem straight away and gave me antibiotics. I am very pleased about this. The reason I have 4 not 5 stars is because after my surgery doctors literally vanished and I did not get any after care advise, which I believe it is weird, since I am pretty sure after surgery is done, some comments should be given since the surgery was done to a very delicate place. I was only given antibiotics recipe and told to come back in 2 weeks.",4
Please investigate ward D7. It's like a club when the doctors go home. Bhangra music is blasted so is Reggae. The nurses during the day don't care. So gald my father left last week . Please take my advice go to another hospital.  This one is full of children trying to act like nurses,1
"Saw a Rheumatologist here due to having horrendous joint pain for a number of years, mostly located in my hip. The Dr. I saw was very brash. After a very brief examination and flicking through my x-ray, MRI and blood test history, he told me there was absolutely nothing wrong with my joints - especially my hip. I should just learn to live with the pain because “sometimes there’s just nothing we can do for it.”

Obviously this statement caused me to burst into tears, the Dr was very awkward about this. Told me that he wasn’t used to seeing patients in-clinic anymore because of Covid so he didn’t know what to say to me. He told me he would book a follow up appointment with me in a couple of months. This consisted of one of his colleagues ringing me to inform me of discharge with no further action (no investigations were ever ordered).

Luckily for me, I eventually got referred to a wonderful surgeon who works at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital. He told me I have hip dysplasia and I will need surgery to fix it and prevent me from needing a new hip.

Good job I didn’t listen to the Rheumatologist that works at City Hospital who told me I was fine.",1
"The staff is good and caring. You have to be cooperative with the security staff. Only one patient is allowed to enter the Hospital (1 relative with under 16 child).

The worst thing is that you have to wait in queue for Triag and Registration + extra 4 to 8 hours to see a doctor. It is just because of too many patients everyday",3
I dont have a good experience in this hospital the nurs is not good,1
"I feel obliged to give a 5-star review to City Hospital and especially to the maternity section because the negative reviews we can read on Google are unfair to the extent of my personal experience.

When our local GP announced to my wife that she would be monitored at City Hospital and that she would give birth there, both of us were depressed. This was because we were negatively biased by reviews on the Internet.

After several unsuccessful attempts to change hospital, my wife and I decided to bite the bullet and proceed with City Hospital. And I'm glad we did.

From the monitoring sessions up to the delivery, the midwives and doctors have been immensely kind and supportive to me and my wife. My wife gave birth on March 5th, 2022. Clearly, they met and even exceeded our expectations in many different ways.

So, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the maternity staff of City Hospital. You did a wonderful job, and this was very much appreciated.",5
"Rubbish staff no respect
Wait time is too long
Everyone is rude",1
"I was with my friend here who fell over and needed stitches. He had major concussion. I'm shocked how many people come here, laughing and joking and seem to think it's an emergency. The service is basic.",2
"Words fail to describe how appalling the level of service is from this hospital.  My dad had a stroke and we were told to take him to city hospital and as soon as we reached there we were told to queue outside due to covid.  When we eventually got inside we were told by a nurse who looked unsympathetic to say the least that there were no beds and “they can’t do anything!”  This was a very upsetting and traumatic experience for my dad, my mum and myself.  The service here is terrible.",1
"Went to a&e to get my 21 month old toddler checked out. Got there at 2am left at 5am. Witnessed staff on breaks and not many staff on shift. There wasn't many people waiting either.
This hospital is filthy. Even the nurse told us to sit away from other patients in waiting area as there were unsavoury kinds. When we finally got to see the doctor my toddler being curious walked over to a bin in the room and the doctor said not to touch as its covered in blood and it was! the floor was filthy, just shocking..  hospital needs a LOT of money spent on it, totally understand why the staff dont seem like they want to be there. I would never visit this hospital again which is a shame since the nurse and doctor we had were very knowledgeable and good with our son.",1
"Seen very promptly last night after a fall, straight into X-ray, and sion after to doctor’s review. (Fractured clavicle ad humeral head)
Offered good advice re pain relief and appointments going forward, I’m sorry I can’t remember the names of all the staff but you all were brilliant. Do a difficult job kindly and with good humour, thank you and thank the NHS 💙💙💙",5
Paramedics are lovely and show empathy and care and are supportive,5
"City hospital is amazing. Always been looked after here whenever I've needed medical help. In yesterday for hernia repair and all the nurses and surgeons were so nice and friendly, informing me every step of the way and always checking and having a chat. Only wish I could thank each person that helped me yesterday because I appreciate it so much",5
Staff are very hellpul. Kept clean and feel sorry fof the staff using out dated equipment. Open ing times fof AM.U is 11.00 to 8pm. Saddly needs upgradring here,1
"The doctors and nurses are amazing, very thorough and efficient. They would be helped in their work if admin was half as good, lost of time wasted unnecessary waiting. There is a little cafe in the waiting area... The coffee is awful.",5
"Don't go here if you got covid! This place is very run down and outdated. It was like a dungeon! Patients are packed like sardines here! There's no space to move. I had a horrible stay here. When I first came here with covid, the staff was very rude towards me for not having the vaccine. I do want the vaccine but there was no need to be rude about it.

I was later moved to another hospital, after my condition got worse. They didn't have the equipment to save my life. They lost my stuff when I was here the first time. Which I'm still trying to get compansation for.

When I was later got move back to this hospital, after I was in a coma for weeks in another hospital. Which was outside Birmingham btw. I didn't want move back here because I wanted to be moved to Heartlands or Queen Elizabeth's hospital. When I did move back here against my wishes, I couldn't get much sleep because they leave the lights on until half 11/12 at night. The staff also talk really loudly during the night.

The nurses in the ward that I was moved too were so rude towards me. I had limited movements from my coma but they still thought I could do everything for myself. Had so many arguments with the nurses about it. Left me so low and depressed.

Noise is also a problem here. They blast the radio all day, so I couldn't get any peace and quite. They start playing the radio at 7am in the morning but wake you up at 5/6am in the morning for covid swipes and to check your heart rate . Also there is a lack of communication with doctors, nurses and patients. One person tells you one thing  but never gets passed on to others. They also lie a lot!

Worst hospital I've ever stayed in. Left me so depressed. Don't ever come here if you got covid. Go to Queen Elizabeth hospital instead.

I will seek legal action against this place. Awful place!",1
"I was in accident and emergency couldn't believe how quickly i was seen staff were very friendly can't fault anyone. I was taken to overnight ward and nurses couldn't do enough for me,ward was spotless and food was absolutely delicious. So thank you so much to all the doctors and nurses and staff. for all you did for me",5
"My sister got sent for having recurring suicidal attempts and thoughts. They made her wait for over 6 hours just to dismiss her by saying that forward thinking won’t come to see her as it isn’t a emergency and that she has support because she has a big family and that because she doesn’t have a plan to end her life at the moment it isn’t important for forward thinking to come to visit her. She also gave crisis team numbers that my sister said she already has and  which she responded to that was “I will give it to you anyways, so that I can sleep at night” and giggled. The nurse was very disrespectful and clearly didn’t care to show any remorse and was very unprofessional. I don’t understand how they can’t take a suicidal persons problem seriously.",1
bad customer service and rude attitude i feel like they been forced to work dirty place,1
"excellent service from the  cardiac day care team  and Dr Sharma
and her team  ,thanks  .",5
"This place is massive, it doesn't look that big, there are so many different buildings it is very confusing. There is a multistorey car park available but this is not sign posted very well. Me and my husband didn't even know what was public car parks or private staff car parks. We ended up parking 10 minutes away from where we needed to be. Once we got over the whole parking faf. The staff inside the hospital were helpful and kind. I was welcomed with hand sanitizer and a face mask. The treatment centre is next to the main entrance to the hospital I don't know what the difference is but again just ask the staff or show them a letter and they will get you to where you need to be. Just give your self an extra 30 minutes befor your appiontment.",4
"Unclean.
Midwives are very supportive and helpful. But the hospital lacks cleanliness which I believe must be a major problem.",2
"The five stars is for one midwife in particular. Liz Kellie. She is absolutely patient and understanding. I have only seen her twice but she ensures I leave my appointments feeling reassured. I expressed some concerns I have with my pregnancy, I really feel she goes the extra mile. I haven't had the best experiences with the Triage department.",5
"It’s a shame this hospital have rude staff member not all, the women in the reception at 1am (03-02-2022) was very polite to my wife but it was a shame they had 5 hours wait. My wife was in very bad state she was in too much pain and she was told to wait for 5 hours for the doctor to see her.
Hospitals really need to up their game and Employ more  doctors so that the people who are in pain can get seen quick as possible it’s not fare on the people who have to wait a long time to see a doctor who are suffering in a lot of pain and also hospitals need to allow at least 1 person to sit with the Patient As some patients don’t like to be left alone and would like a family member to be with them",1
"Took my daughter to the surgical unit for an operation on her broken wrist. Apart from the long wait I had waiting for her to come back from the operation which took about four hours, I have to say they were very efficient. Most of the staff were very friendly and helpful but there was the odd one who was very abrupt. Also on returning to fetch my daughter the staff work station must of had about ten nurses round it all talking doing nothing which I found very intimidating. The nurse thar checked her out was very thorough and explained everything that we needed to know for taking her home.",3
"I am very pleased with outcome of all my consultations and subsequent treatment at this hospital over a 12 month period.  On the whole, Doctors and nurses were kind, caring, compassionate and professional. Big Thank-you to Mr Parker, Mrs Sinha and all the staff on D21. I was pleasantly surprised and am truly grateful.",5
"Visited Nuclear medicine dept today for treatment. Had already had a knowledgeable phone call from a member of staff a few weeks ago and Jilly, who I saw today was very helpful and Dr Pandit",5
"alot of rude staff ,no compassion,shouldn't be in health care",1
"Arrived at A&E with fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The staff were fantastic - I was on a drip within 30 mins, and they quickly managed my pain and nausea. All of the nurses were kind and attentive, the wards were clean, and Covid safety measures were in place. So grateful for such a swift recovery!",5
Brilliant I can only say the care my son received was above and beyond. Made the whole day less stressful. A big thank you to everyone involved in my son's cross linkage procedure. He was in the children's opthalmic ward I think. Would like to give a special mention to the nurse called Sarah who was looking after him she was fantastic. Thanks again to all involved.,5
"Emergency Department team was absolutely brilliant, kind and caring staff especially the HCAs and receptionist, The Doctors I saw was great they were very busy took me ages to leave but hey it's ED we have to expect that.Any faults had nothing to do with staff and their competence it's just the system setup.",5
Felt really bad with acid reflux but Me not knowing that I haven't eaten in 6 weeks feel weak lost a lot of weight and also been feeling like commiting suicide today. All day said is deal with the pain and most staff are rude their,1
"Came to be induced on a Tuesday morning and apparently they only give jacket potato for lunch and dinner is a COLD sandwich!
As it is only pregnant women on this ward I feel this is dredfull oh and breakfast is 2 slice of toast, so in a whole 24 hours they give you 4 slice of bread 2for toast and 2for sandwich and a jacket potato. Nothing else is give I have been told to go and get my own food but I'm not allowed to leave the hospital. Good old",1
"There Maternity ward in city Hospital is one of the worst places on earth. Lack of empathy, Lack of care, unprofessional staff. Horrible & rude attitude towards patients. Lack of professional advice. Not just the midwives & Nurses even the qualified Doctors are  not interested in Medical Emergency rather busy in giggling & gossiping.
My wife would have rather given Birth at home. These unprofessional people have made this Hospital one of the worst places to be during pregnancy.
I personally think there Maternity ward should be sealed & banned due to health & safety concerns of patients.
Have not been able to make a formal complaint due to lack of information provided.
Avoid ! Avoid ! Avoid !",1
"The hospital is very busy and some patients can be unseen or left to get in a mess at times due to the lack of support and nurses that have mother meetings at night. Its hard to rest in there as the nurses are loud up to 3am and keep the lights on until sometimes 2am and can have loud group socials with each other laughing and chatting till late. Some times I had to wait 2 hours holding my urine bursting when I could not walk to the toilet.
I was a patient there for 4 weeks with a heart infection and dvt and my list of complaint could go on but one I must mention is my release that was given at the 4week period was initialised with the doctor telling me I had to get a check in back in person once a week to have my bloods taken and reviewed and was told to check in two weeks later. I did so and at the right time and date to be told they had no idea of what I was going on about as the doctor had given me the verbal to check in when I had left. What is this about? No letters no computer data. Left to wonder am I still OK. Not good",2
"Have to put 1 star to leave a review. Been here just over 5 hours and no one has seen this 71 year old patient. He appears to have a dislocated finger and definitely  a head injury and no one has bothered with him. It is disgusting. If a patient died here at triage nothing would be done.  Its absolutely  disgusting. This place needs to get things sorted. One of the receptionists is utterly  rude, she needs to check herself into a college and learn about  how to talk to the public.",1
"Went to Sheldon Block,  Skin dept. Quick check in.  About 15 minutes waiting over appointment time. Dr.  very pleasant and efficient.",4
"just returned home after eight days between sandwell and city hospital i have had ECG's heart and lung scans,and xrays. i cannot praise enough the care and treatment iv'e received during my stay there,not only to doctors and nurses but also all other staff including catering staff you couldn't receive better treatment if you paid for it.i would like to say a really big thank you to everyone, and to our NHS .",5
"Had a gall bladder removal operation today. From the reception to the surgeon in fact every staff member I came into contact with were exceptional.
You all should be so proud. So impressed.
Thank you so much. Paul. T.",5
"Uk rules very bad no emotion no feelings
This reason I lost my father",2
"Went to A and E made me wait outside in the cold told me to fill in a form finally got called in a Jamaican triage nurse told me they can't do much about my fractured Toe like she was a doctor! she told me to take a seat in waiting area after waiting 3 hrs I went back to her and said I still haven't been seen she said oh you haven't been booked in you never handed your form on the other desk I said you told me to take a seat in the waiting area after taking my dob name and address you never told me to hand my form on the other desk!! No apology from her I filed a complaint about her.
While I was waiting in the waiting area I seen the 2 triage nurses laughing at a patient that came in and joking about him! I was shocked.
Finally got called in by a nurse practitioner she refused to xray my foot and said I might have broken bones she put salatape around my foot and told me go home I will recover in 6 weeks!  I didn't even got seen by a doctor!
Absolutely waste of my tax money!!!",1
"Possibly the worst place to receive treatment - I did not get that far. After suffering chronic toothache for the past 3 days, no sleep, a temperature, being sent home from work because I looked ill, and not succeeding in getting a GP, emergency dental appointment and spending all night in bouts of pain and tears, I was told to take paracetamol. I was bluntly told they do not treat toothache. No other questions asked. I was told to go to the Scott Arms and pay for treatment. I cannot easily get to the Scott Arms. I'm 3 days from payday. No address or number was provided. No other advice given.
I went to A&E for help because I have life long a blood condition, for me any serious dental procedures need to take place at a hospital and I need a prescription for the pain that has kept me awake for the past 3 days. I was on the phone with the 111 service until 1AM and was advised to get stronger over the counter painkillers as paracetamol, ibuprofen, co-codamol and co-dydramol is not easing my suffering. I am now facing the fact that I will not receive a prescription or treatment until September.
Avoid this hospital. Abrupt and unhelpful staff who do not ask, just assume, and do not provide help unless you crawl through the door.

Further update 29/12/2021:
Managed to see my dentist at the beginimg of September 2021 due to chronic pain,  gum and ear swelling . Had an x-ray and found that I have an infection of the tooth. Referral to the hospital dental dept as I cannot have an extraction at a dental practice due to my longterm blood condition- hence why I went to City Hospital for help. I was seen by the dental consultant last week, had another x-ray; the infection has worsened and spread. I have to have an extraction. Thanks to the pure ignorance of the hospital staff at City for leaving me in a desperate state of chronic pain. I can only thank the rude and unhelpful staff at the City Hospital for turning me away. Who knows what the staff would've gotten wrong if I was admitted to their hospital's 'care'.",1
"Blood test the 2 staff at the reception were unbothered to help, completely ignoring the patient and staring at the computer, over the phone before going to my appointment today they were very unhelpful and disinterested.  The lady at the xray reception was very helpful and lovely though. The 2 girls from the blood test need to learn how to interact with their costumers!!",2
"My daughter was admitted into maternity unit yesterday as her waters have broken.  Someone was sick in the bathroom last night and staff were notified.  The bathroom wasn't cleaned until about an hour ago.  No disinfectant or any such cleaner was used and the housekeeper used the water that was left on the floor from when someone had used the shower. The room my daughter is in is filthy. Nothing was wiped down and my daughter has been left to sit/lie on a wet bed. Dusty window sill. Broken table leg and what looks like vomit behind the bed. Nursing staff and Drs have been lovely but it's filthy.
It's made a miserable maternity experience.
I wouldn't recommend it.  Daughter is on antibiotics so there is no risk of infection to baby but the uncleanliness isn't positive",1
"I Had an accident and fell over in city centre, I was taken by ambulance to City Hospital.  I was badly shaken and had a fractured wrist etc.  my experience from the ambulance staff was excellent and comforting, and I had the same experience at the hospital from the reception, nurses, x-ray and the doctor who was lovely and reassuring, all this makes such a difference when u are feeling shook up, scared and not sure what's going to happen. All this when they have already been at work  hours.Yes I may have had a long wait, but bearing in mind it's a Friday night after 11.30 pm and I had to have an x-ray and arm plastered.  I have nothing but praise thank you so much. Dorothy",5
"Receptionists have no manners especially when she said shes the senior member of staff and giving attitude to evrey one, if she cant handle the pressure dont work there its simple. Made me wait 4 hours then said I have to wait another 7 hours and I was having severe chest pains. Worst A&E ever. Hospital needs to sort staff out.",1
"Was booked in by 111 then told by the hospital, the hospital does not abide by 111 call referrals.
Sat over 3 hours in A&E, not attended to, people who came in way after were seen to and left. If you need medical attention avoid this hospital and go to another. If you have nothing else to do and need to waste the entire day, come to City hospital.",1
"Went to A&E following a fall hurting my wrists.

Staff were very pleasant, waiting time could be improved, but with government cutbacks it is to be expected.

Was waiting in the plaster room, no one else around, so I couldn't understand why I was waiting so long as the doctor was waiting for me to return. Eventually had my fractured wrist plastered.

Overall very good, been treated many times at city, mostly positive, but room for improvements.",4
"Staff very unfriendly care minimal, state of cleanliness very poor",1
"Was in A&E , the nurse team and the head nurse very messy and the most terrible thing was they are big liar....and they dare to upload their lie onto the computer(in-patient's progress record)。

That bad experience to be lodged to the hospital officially by email.

From : HKger Mom n patient",1
"Please go somewhere else. I have never met such incompetent nurses and doctors in my entire life. They have no clue about their duties. Nurses are flaffing around everywhere. They don’t even know how to do your blood pressure, took them over 45 minutes to take a blood test. Lost my urine sample and then mixed the second one up which showed being positive, which is crazy. Then re booked because of this error and sent for other tests to convince them I was not pregnant. Then second occasion was far worse experience than the first time. I actually lost my cool. They Need to understand that mere mortals that come to the hospital may also have important jobs and important matters outside of the hospital. Please understand that when someone is upset by your incompetence please don’t patronise them more. If I can avoid I will avoid this place.",1
"long hours wait BUT strangely, they have a banging cheap breakfast place",3
Have been coming to this hospital since I was born it is a Stones throw from my house the service is good and professional. And they are public restrooms to use also for disabled people they are separate bathrooms places often clean and tidy there is an ATM machine also hot and cold food and drinks are available. They are also sandwiches and hot and cold drinks available public restrooms for everybody to use including wheelchair access the only complaint I would have about this hospital is that the waiting times are very long depending on which day you go but the service is always good and professional and would recommend to family and friends,5
"Gave birth here in July 2019. You hear far to many horror stories but I can't fault the care I received at all.
I was in triage, moved to M1 then M2 and had an emergency section so visited theatre as well, the care I received from everyone was fantastic.
Everything was explained to me, nothing was too much trouble for the staff and I felt reassured the whole time I was there.
Carmen one of the midwives was amazing as were the theatre staff.",5
"That place is disgusting and I’m not talking only about the lack of hygiene. Been to the children’s A&E few times with my daughter and today with my 3 months old son. The doctor was rude, arrogant and was sitting and chatting with other staff while we, the patients waited patiently to be seen.

The receptionists in the main area had a “do not bother me” attitude, no one ever asked us why we are there, no eye contact, nothing..seemed more interested again, to chat between each other.

Overall, my impression is that this place is full of lazy people who are not interested of doing their job and are just waiting for their shift to be over. Also, very dirty hospital. Avoid.",1
I was an inpatient here over a week ago. And I cannot fault any of the people who looked after me. The care I received was wonderful. All the nurses and doctors were very friendly and that certainly helped considering the state I was in.,5
"Had a very good experience at City hospital, the nursing staff are excellent very helpful and knowledgeable - special shout out to Simone on Ward D7 - brilliant !",5
"Worst hospital to give birth in. Serenity unit needs improving midwives look like they can’t bothered to do their job. A midwife of Caucasian background with ginger hair needs to be re trained! Couldn’t figure out the difference between me being dilated. Was told to push when I wasn’t ready. Was also offered epidural at 9cm?!

Poor practice seriously needs investigating! The wards are horrid and overwhelming  and lack of support makes you suffer ptsd later on. Please choose other hospitals. It’s like a prison",1
My husband attended the nuclear imaging department. The staff were so lovely kind and caring. Explained everything in detail. I can not fault the hospital staff in any way. We are back again on Monday in same clinic. Thank you staff you are brilliant.,5
If I could leave no star I would! This is the worst hospital I’ve ever been to in my whole entire life! Hospital?  More like back street morgue! These people do not give a heck about your health l. My friend was in the worst pain ever and they sent her away! She obviously needed medical help and they were laughing at her like witches! I can’t believe this hospital is still running up! I have every right to believe these people have a race motive! If I could sue I would! If you love life and health! Please for the love of God stay away and go to another hospital. I rest my case !,1
"The A&E department is a complete joke. Feel for those who are in pain and agony, as you will have to wait for up to 7 hours for a complete diagnosis. This is routed in the procedural requirements for each test; Bloods, ECG, blood pressure etc. Patients are called individually for each test separately, meaning that the waiting area is continuously completely full, as people are called back and forth within their allocated 4-7 hours. Each test can have an hours wait between them, which is absurd.

The main receptionists (A&E walk-in) have no people skills and no regard to patient problems. However,  the receptionists in the nursing test area genuinely try to alleviate people’s concerns and try to make the best out of a bad situation

One of the nurses  (Afro-Caribbean) nurse very unprofessional and no regard for hygiene (cleaned the sink and then rinsed hands for a merely a second and continued to take blood pressure readings and tending to patients-DISGUSTING). The doctors themselves (students and foundation are attentive and good). Nurses in initial A&E area could be more attentive rather than sending individuals to the wrong areas. One of the female consultants should add the word ‘sorry’ or ‘pardon’ to her vocabulary as the word ‘ehh’ does not suffice when not understanding what the patient is saying. Not how an educated person would behave.

Best visit A&E Queen Elizabeth next time, as will save you an entire day!",1
"I have my rhinoplasty surgery done today, all the staff at adult surgical 1 are amazing and looked after me. Especially Nurse Stephanie Williams who absolutely incredible. Looked after me post surgery, an incredible human being. Thank you soo much for everything you did💫🙏",5
This was my first time at the city hospital after suffering a mild heartattack all the staff are very helpful and understanding on ward D7 plus everyone involved in me having a angiogram keep up the good work .,5
"Prompt & friendly attention, but have to return for imagery as it was closed.",4
Visited a&e yesterday. Do not rate some staff of the day shift as they just palm you off to the walk in clinic and was prescribed antibiotics for a uti. Refused and rechecked myself in to see the Dr in a&e. Had bloods urine and fluid. Turns out I didn't have a uti but was severely dehydrated and needed a different source of tablets as my heart rate was so high. The night shift there are absolutely amazing! Big shout out to the guy who has Kye tattooed on his neck (I can't rememebr the name sorry) his the loveliest man I've ever met. Also the nurses are fab and so friendly. Always chose city over any other hospital,5
"Attended a@e today,  and I have to say the service was excellent,  all the staff we came into contact with were really helpful and polite. One member of staff really stood out her name is Gulshan ( a nurse) I found her to be professional, caring, and nothing was to much trouble for her. she explained everything she was  doing and kept us updated as to where we would be going after a@e,  she is a credit to  your hospital",5
"Really good hospital. I am not from England and they help me so nicely even with the difference of language.
They are helpfull and friendly.
They know what they do.",5
"We had our daughter at Birmingham City maternity ward a few days ago. We were in the Halcyon and Serenity birthing centres, followed by the delivery ward. The care from the midwives and doctors was incredible at every stage. Truly humbling. The birthing centres are fantastic facilities with everything we needed and more.We'll never forget the encouragement, support, smiles, hugs and kind words from the team. Thank you.",5
What can I say but THANK YOU. After being in a bit of a three car shunt ALL the staff were so kind. From the lovely Security Guard to the nice man doing observations  ( Sorry my BP was a bit eyewateringly high...it scared me too) to the lovely nurses. The three Dr's I saw were very professional and above all kind especially the fabulous GP trainee. Housekeeper was fantastic too and took time to speak to me. The lovely nurse who found me lost and wandering to get back thanks to you too. And for my pain relief! I was offered a cuppa and a Sandwich too. Thank you so proud and humbled by the care you gave me. Thanks for taking care of me xx Sue from NICU,5
"My names Raheela, I visited the endoscopy unit at city hospital on the 30th April 2021. The reception was so kind and had a welcoming attitude the Dr who performed my Colonoscopy Mr Anil George was great he explained all the procedure. Inside HCA Vanessa Brown and nurse Alan Valdez were kind caring and compassionate I was scared they reassured me, Vanessa held my hand and was taking my mind off the procedure by asking me about my children, I opted for Anaesthesia but because I had 23 biopsies I was in a lot of pain they also gave me gas and air. They kept my dignity and all times throughout the procedure, when I came into recovery nurse Mohammed looked after me again he was caring and compassionate, can not fault the service excellent service long live the NHS.",5
Last three week i was suffering from vomiting and today i went to hospital because my vomiting is not stopping and when i reached hospital they took 1 hour to take sample of my blood after that i vomited twice time in  the hospital and i went to staff i told them please help me. And they took 2 hours for giving me my test reports they told me your test is normal and you go back home and i vomited every 15 20 min again and again . I went to incharge of nurse and i told her i cant feel well and i vomited again and again and she replied go back ur home or if you want to meet to doctor you have to wait 4 hours  minimum. I arrived approxmatiely 10.30pm in the hospital and i back to my  home at 4.00am but no doctor come to me and see me and she told me vomiting is normal thing but she cant understand i vomiting 5 times in last 1to  2 hours and i came back to home and i am still vomiting i am student but no one helping us this is redicilious.   Please help me,1
"Absolutely vile staff! And they wonder why they get abuse! My brother went in for mental health reasons and they wouldn't even assess him, he was discharged straight away. Absolutely disgusting! They should be ashamed of themselves!",1
"I took my 3 year old daughter her for her pulled arm, the staff were very lazy and careless and the worst thing was that when the doctor finally decide to place a cast on my daughter he did it whilst standing, not even looking at my daughters arm whilst she was on my lap and in a few seconds he was done, he told me that I should take it off as soon as she moves her arm again.

My daughter would still cry every night and seem uncomfortable and i was never sure why she would cry so much.

3 days later she started to move her arm and i decided to take it off she seemed relived and i was shocked when i saw purple bruises and small red marks due to poor circulation in my 3 year old daughters arm.

Please dont trust the doctors i urge you to use your own instincts as i didnt because i trusted the doctor for doing his job correctly, when he didnt and it lead to my daughter being in endless uncomfort and unnecessary pain, crying for 2 nights straight.",1
"First off the signage of the hospital is garbage so unless you know exactly where you're going you'll need to ask a member of staff for directions. I'm currently waiting in the maternity triage ward with my wife who may be experiencing complications 35 weeks into her pregnancy. We've been here since 1830 and have yet to be seen. We sit with 2 other couples, all worried and as yet unseen. Its currently 1900 as of writing this. We gained access to the triage ward through tailgating a staff member as nobody answered the door entry system. This is the second time I've been to the hospital, the first time my wife went to A&E due to abnormal bleeding. It took around 2 hours for her to be seen then, too. I'm not sure if its a lack of staff, a lack of other resources or simply a lack of interest but based on our experience it is clear that this hospital is not fit for purpose and unable to deal with even minimal medical incidents.
Edit - 1940, still waiting.",1
"The lady doctor I saw on Monday 29 th March 2021 at city hospital was a joke.
I had waited 3 hrs for on going pain which  was awful.
Didn't even check me properly, just kept on complaining about the NHS service and equipment, she couldn't even use a computer printer properly.
Her lack of English was awful I couldn't not understand her properly.
I just feel sorry for all the patients she must have seen that day.
She said she would right to my Dr which its been over a week and my Dr said they have not heard of her.
She did not even provide any paper work either.
These kind of Drs are Lacking resources of the taxpayers and shouldn't be known as Drs.
All they do is blame the pandemic, so not speaking the English language or understanding is due to the pandemic to makes me question the NHS",1
"I was on triangle for give birth. The nurse was amazing, very helpful and nice. Im waiting foe labour 3 days, but i dontt feel there stressful. All the time somebody come to checking how i feel and everything was professional. The nursing who was help me give birth was very nice. I was meet many people there and everyone was very nice. I recommend for all future mum.",5
"My husband was seriously unwell so i called 999. An ambulance was dispatched but on arrival the ambulance team were dismissive of  any serious risk to him following a sixty second ECG being normal. They suggested he drive himself in morning if he still felt unwell.
I insisted that he would not be safe to drive himself to hospital and had serious concerns to the ambulance crew. Eventually after my persistence this ambulance crew reluctantly took him to City Hospital but did little else.
On arrival the hospital team here immediately took him under their wing, did additional tests and confirmed he had experienced a heart attack. ( This was confirmed by a blood test) He was fitted with a stent within two hours. Well done and thankyou City Hospital and the staff that took care of him I am forever grateful and in your debt. Not such good words for the ambulance team, I could have lost him that night if I hadn't trusted my instincts and spoke out on his behalf.",5
Super staff and was well looked after,5
"I travel 120 mile round trip to visit the  Treatment Center to my consultant every 3 mths. Staff are friendly and the centre is spotless. With the virus, the centre is manned with only patients allowed in after checking. I recommend city I always have 1st class care. The main hospital functions well and is clean, bearing in mind it was built in the 1800.",4
"My daughter's care during her first pregnancy has been a concern. Lack of empathy for her severe pain and anxiety, poor communication and lack of information even now when she's full term. Covid can't be blamed for individuals demonstrating poor behaviours at appointments. This needs attention urgently - I've been appalled at some of the things she's told me about hospital and community midwives handling of her pregnancy.",1
Very bad care provided. Sat and waited 3 hours not knowing they left us waiting in the wrong department! Very bad practice… this hospital puts the NHS TO SHAME. It’s dirty and unclean and staff and RUDE,1
"Got there at 7.50am for a 8.10am appointment.  Fair enough was told by two security men at the door that the treatment centre wasn't open till 8am. I was wearing a mask as it was requested on the letter. Both security had no masks on and no social distancing as they answered other patients queries. These are patients that have probably been shielding, at a hospital for appointments and in a very high risk area for covid 19 and you have two men  working without masks on with signs everywhere saying you must wear a mask. We have no hope.
We have to protect the nhs staff and patients please.",1
"Pathetic, waited for 4 hours, went to desk a few times, was told it is 3 hour wait, then was told that my son's name was called 4 times at different times from one hour onwards, they are liars, as we were there all the time, well alert,  they never called his name.Then said we need to rebook again to be in the queue.  Left in utter frustration.  They deserve negative feedback, no respect for anyone. Very disappointed,  disgraceful service. 👎😡",1
"Awful service. Nurses don't want to know about anything do not care about any pain you're in. Only given 1 cup of tea a day hardly ever come round to check if you're okay even if you press the buzzer requesting a nurse it takes them 50 minutes to come round even though the buzzer is going off loud enough. Food portions are ridiculously small and the person who brings the food round is so miserable and rude, knows nothing about the food",1
"I had been recalled from my first ever mammogram. Obviously, I felt very nervous, but the Dr and nurses were fantastic! They talked me through each step, and what it was they were concerned about. So thorough. Thank you all very much. You're doing a wonderful job.",5
"In February 2018 I had the misfortune of spending 13 days on ward D17 where not only was I extremely let down by the terrible care offered by the majority of the nursing staff, but I had my handbag with my purse, bank cards, driving license, diary & house keys stolen from next to my bed!!! The security staff were as useless as a chocolate teapot!! I would avoid this hospital like the plague.",1
"It should be zero star.. got bad experienc
ed here from the past. Not treated properly when I got my miscarriaged baby. I forgive those people even they never apologised for the treatment I got ( some lazy nurses) and wrong diagnosed about my baby's
condition.hope they already improve their
service esp to pregnant people",1
"Absolutely rubbish hospital worse worse hospital I have ever experienced,I'm sat here with my 3 year old son at 1am his asleep on these really uncomfortable chairs and when u ask If they have a pillow for his head they go mad! Staffs behaviour is disgusting so rude towards u! I waited her for 2 hours wit my son I seen ppl come in ages after me and get seen way before me! U would think they put children first! Absolutely disgusted by this hospital and the staff!! P.s. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star!!!!!",1
"Absolutely disgusted with the senior nurses attitude my daughter was taken in by ambulance and put in waiting room only to be told it's not an emergency so she will be 13th  to be seen , I totally understand there are people with more serious issues but I donot agree of been spoke to in such a dont care attitude,  the hospital isnt the cleanest of places either. I was always lead to believe nurse and doctors should have a bit more compassion obviously this one particular nurse needs to go and have lessons in respect, attitude towards patience and compassion for her job.",1

"Waiting here to see a gp for my 8 year old, they have one gp for a Friday morning that has no sense of urgency, it’s taken him almost 4 hours to see 4 patients. I’m a patient guy but this needs to be addressed and takes the cake, if he walks any slower he would be asleep.",1
"I had my surgery 3 weeks ago in BTC - amazing care, I felt safe and well looked after. They made my stay in there a very pleasent expierience. I can't thank enough for excellent care.",5
"My niece has her second child at City Hospital and reported that her care was wonderful, with really supportive, kind staff across the board. Thank you so much for your loving care City and Sandwell team! ❤️",4
Really nice polite nurses who looked after my husband after heart attack,5
My mrs has had an bad experience because she called to see if she can come early to the appointment due to medical issue and also having diabetes and they said they have no bed. The also leave everything to last minute. And then things got worse and she is still in the hospital for 12 days. They said the tissue specialist is going to coming today but the doctor said she had to go without her being see. Now another doctor came and she saw her and she said she is going to talk to the lady doctor and the report will come within 2 to 3 hours. They do not care at all. They also say they have no doctors available and they also say no bed available. Good for nothing. I wish i could no stars to this hospital.,1
"So helpful and they went above and beyond in treating me. They could've just told me to go to my GP and left it at that but instead they did numerous tests on their own. The wait was to be expected, but I would definitely recommend this hospital.",5
Worst hospital to come too. I was booked in by my doctor and also told by the 111 team that I needed to go hospital ASAP when I arrived I was turned away straight away by the girls at the desk because my nose and face was too swollen. The whole reason for me coming here was because of my nose n face swelling.,1
"Well 5 stars for a wonderful nurse called Anika ( that I call her my bestie) at the emergency department!! She was soo nice and caring she made sure that I was okay throughout my stay at her department!
I kept on calling her but she was always coming with a big smile on her face and always taking my needs as a priority!! Well dn bestie!!",5
very bad patient care in emergency department. i was brought in by an ambulance due to chest pain and shortness of breath but i was not in a bad condition upon arriving i saw a girl on the bed dieing with abdominal pain and vomiting screaming all over but no nurse or doctors came to her aid..they just watch her in pain and ignore..extremely bad service very dissapointed,1

"I visited the A&E department on 6th September 2018. I was accompanying a family member who was experiencing severe chest pain and dizziness. Having visited the GP twice for these ailments with no outcome, we decided that A&E was our last hope, only to be told by the nurse that my family member could have ""just taken paracetamol"". Are you having a laugh? Do you not think we would have exhausted all options before coming here? After eventually  being seen by the doctor, we were told that they could do nothing for my family member or conduct no further investigations. Back to the GP we were told to go. A complete waste of time. AVOID!",1
"The staff at this hospital should be sacked, their still stopping loved ones visiting dying relatives. This hospital hands you your loved ones belongings tell you to leave and leaves your loved to die alone. This should investigated",1
"A&E - Disgraceful.
MADE TO WAIT 4HRS , TO BE TOLD NO EQUIPMENT IS NOW AVAILABLE AND GIVEN NO MEDICATION OR PAIN RELIEF.
Staff attitude and service stinks.
Visited, extreme throat pain and was finding it difficult to breathe. having asthma. Originally went to West Bromwich but was advised to go to Dudley Rd as they have ENT department by a nurse.
When I arrived at Dudley rd the triage nurse,   Blond elderly women took it upon herself to not  believe me and thought I had decided to visit the A&E for DAY OUT as i had come from A&E else where ? her attitude stank. I hr later a JUNIOR ENT  informed me I would now be seen by and ENT doctor , so i decided to wait.
3 hours later l was told by a grinning patronising doctor no equipment was available in the entire hospital to look at my throat??? ,
I told him this not acceptable,  why  WAS I NOT  told this earlier, instead of making  me wait 4hs??   ""Sorry  HE SAID,  I was told there was equipment   but there was'n't now"" ??  ""and it was not an emergency and no equipment is available""',  really  ???
The doctor was grinning, very patronising  and said good luck when i leaving, just to rub it in further.  It seems quite clear to me the staff and the doctors had no intention of treating me but under guidelines gave me lip service and waisted 4hrs  of my time?
4 hrs ???.  Yes my taxes pay these  for these sanctimonious NHS staff. Seriously this is the great NHS staff . No medication or treatment given. Don't go to this place, these people are putting your health at risk.  Disgraceful.",1
I had my twins here and i never had any more of my children here again put it that way! Had a c section and was stapled up ( not my wishes ) then nobody helped me during recovery or checked on me regularly. Only toilet on ward had blood all over the floor and was told ide have to walk to a new ward to use the bathroom which was impossible as i had only just gotten to my feet and ended up having to step over the blood and use it all night it was still there until next morning. Had a fit in the shower and was started on medication for epilepsy?? Then given too higher dose resulting in memory loss not knowing where i was or who my children were ..very scary but its like staff didnt care about anyone on the ward at all. Had strangers entering my room looking for other patients on the ward and my visitors were let straight through no questions asked or warning. Was a disaster i just would never recommend. My first birth experience i would never wish on anyone else. It had. a big impact on my mental health.,1
"I took someone in. She was hard of hearing and though the staff were friendly, helpful, stressed they made no effort to get her a signer. I was down as next of kin and they didn't consult with me b4 they phones within and hour of me leaving to let me know she was moved to another hospital.",4
"Last Thursday I had a silly trip up the curb that resulted in a nasty gash to my head. An ambulance was called and I was taken to City Hospital. The staff in the A & E department were fantastic. They treated me with great kindness whilst remaining skilful and professional. Whilst waiting to be treated I enjoyed an excellent cup of coffee and a superb sandwich from the machines in the waiting area and was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and reasonable cost of the refreshments.  But best of all were the staff, thank you all.

"My partner went in on Monday late afternoon with fever, flu like symptons and severe headaches. Was made to wait outside for about 45 minutes, she said inside no masks were being worn and no hand gel being provided or used.

Was told she was being tested because of the media (had her 2nd astravenaca jab 2 days before). She was out within 2 hours with all tests apparently completed and a clean bill of health.

Popular GP in Erdington referred her to Good Hope in Sutton Coldfield the next morning when symptons didn't improve and is now on her second day with an AV/AB drip awaiting a lumbar puncture as suspected meningitis.",1
A&E is the worst place to be! Nurses at the front desk are rude and the security guard stands next to you the whole time ! No confidentiality whatsoever they shout “why you here”? & asks personal information which everyone in the hospital corridor can hear! I felt very embarrassed to be there even though I was very poorly!,1
"Words can't express and explain how I feel about all the midwives in this hospital,You are so caring and loving,God richly bless,You are just perfect,this is my seventh born ,and your  love is soo great,thank you very much.",5
"Took ages to get to the doctor. Everyone are passing by, but nothing change. 10hours waitingand unsolved problem...",1
Car park staff not helpful and too busy goberling on his sandwich,1
"Attended A&E about 2hrs ago. Had to first approach the desk at reception and was asked why I am presenting today. (No privacy) Receptionist didn’t take all the reasons why I had to attend, just one and abruptly told me to be seated without listening to anything else I tried to say. I had a ECG and on the 1st trace the nurse or (hca) was very understanding and listened to me especially when I had burst into tears. On the 2nd trace I had an a&e nurse who was flippant and rude and not listening to me when I tried to explain my further symptoms. Asked me to have a seat now back in the waiting room so I just walked straight out the exit with ecg stickers still on me I am sat at home, feeling like no one cares, I suffer with severe anxiety and depression and this took a lot for me to go seek help for other symptoms which I did not get. Left that horrible place without one medical person knowing about my other symptoms,  feeling helpless, humiliated, anxious and ill.",1
"First time my wife here today she come out in tears! Horrible place staff and nurses attitude awful! Doctors was blunt and rushed even do we waited for 1.5 hours, my wife felt undignified after test that had to he done and neither nurse or doctor made her feel comfortable in fact she over heard the two women stsff at counter on way out talking about her as the one woman had to be in with her during examination with doctor!!! Awful!",1
"Excellent staff and care  ,endoscopy department, and ct scanning department .
Doctors and Nurses were great
Thank You

"The women carrying out the eye checkups for patients with diabetes really need to learn some basic people skills.  Their attitude stinks.  They're rude and abrupt and make the visit a horrible experience.  The asian girl in particular is the worst one, I don't think the words please or thank you form part of her vocabulary.",1
"I've  been in A&E with my 10 months old baby and I am so disappointed. The worst staff I ever seen, they were really racists and they forgot even to put my babys sugar level result in the papers. We've  been waiting for 4h to see a doctor and instead to come to see the patients they were laughing and talking about their own businesses. My baby had fever he's been crying a lot and they were irritated and looking at us with racism. They treat my baby as an animal.
I will find a lawyer and accuse them for racism. Avoid this hospital if you have a small baby it is so so bad.",1
"13 weeks pregnant, started to bleed. Have been waiting 8 hours to find out if the baby is ok. They’ve literally done nothing. I have my own urine with me in a container they provided this whole time. The reception staff of which there are 4 just sat gossiping for hours, they don’t appear to give a damn. I’ve waited and waited, new people are coming in, being seen before me. I’m a wreck but I guess not a priority. Don’t come here if you are pregnant. The staff don’t care about your pregnancy enough to prioritize it. So glad I’ve paid NI and Tax my whole adult working life.

Update: I’ve since spoken to my doctor and a department at the women’s hospital. They confirm I should have been sent to the EPU (Early pregnancy unit) within city. Because I wasn’t I need to see a doctor to make the referral. I’m still bleeding. They have delayed me getting a scan and piece of mind for a further 24hours. I cannot believe how much they have failed in their duty of care or the absolute state of the place. Worse hospital I’ve ever been to.",1
"My husband went with chest pain and was seen quickly. He was then sent back out to a&e to wait to be discharged by a doctor who was unaware that my husband had a quadruple bypass the previous year. The doctor was shocked he wasn't checked properly and immediately rang reception to be looked at again. An apology was,given but no explanation as to why no proper care in the first place. He was kept in overnight but discharged the next day. Luckily he was fine but the lack of concern was in my view incompetent. I would say that on his previous admission the cardiac dept looked after him very well although he has received no aftercare from either them or new cross where his bypass was performed.very disappointing in that respect.",3
"Almost 42 weeks gone of pregnancy they still let me wait
Already stayed here 3 days
Doctors said tomorrow we’ll deal with u
Now they told me to wait for another day
Horrible for mothers who already complete their 9 months of pregnancy.

Post-mature births carry risks for both the mother and the baby, including fetal malnutrition, meconium aspiration syndrome, and stillbirths.",1
"Absolutely disgusting, I attended hospital in an ambulance suffering with severe abdominal and side pains, I am 2 months pregnant and as we arrived in the ambulance They literally jus took my blood pressure and sent me to the waiting area of A&E, knowing I could barely walk as the pain was major severe, I couldnt even sit down on their uncomfortable chairs, A&E was reallly cold my legs were shaking, I lied down on floor in tears of how strong the pain was, waited hours and hours in agony unbearable pain, Was seen 4 hours and half after Had some bloods taken, no1 even came tell me results, waited like another hour to be sent to pregnancy assessment unit and ended up waiting there another 40 minutes aswell and the two junior doctor and senior doctor I seen were so rude trying to force me do an internal examination when I wasnt comfortable to do, i was told i was having an ultrasound but they tried to change it to internal examination. It was such an awful experience, the nurses could see I was lien down on the floor and wouldnt even ask if ur okay. Awful#disgusting#",1
Waited 7 1/2 hours and then told to come back tomorrow,3
"Rude staff, worst customer service. Disgracful as a whole",1
"I must say this ambulance service are racist. My brother was struggling with serious chest pain and they were treating my mother and brother like a dog. They wasn’t even looking at us and ignoring us. Once we entered the hospital they paramedic and the receptionist said to my brother to stop making the noise and sit silently. They were absolutely ignoring us and saying that it will take time. My brother was asking for a bed to lay down and they said we don’t have a bed. Are you serious guys ?? A patient suffering from chest pain and you are to sit silently. Eventually, we left hospital and didn’t said anything to them and had no medication from the hospital. This is the shitest service ever i saw in my life. You guys should shut this freaking ambulance service and stay at home. You do take taxes from the hard work we do to run our life but when we need help you treat us harshly. Stop being racist and doing this kind of discrimination please, we all are human being. If this happens to you or your family, how would you feel watching them in pain.
UK is class as a non-racist country where people are treated equally and can stand for their right, this is a false statement. This country is totally racist and in case of emergency Police and Ambulance Service will never help you, bare that in mind !!!",1
"No one seemed to know where the pain management department was. After going to one building and 3 different staff, including reception and help desk they said go to another building. We walked about 20 minutes through a car park, lelfting a wheel chair over fencing etc. We were then told to go back to the other building. One lift broken, escalator not working and at the of all that only a vending machine with disgusting tea.",2
"Horrible, rude receptionist!
Worst experience I've ever had in a hospital. Went to A&E with someone who had severe complications because of tonsilitis. We waited for 3 hours which I completely understand as it was a busy night. When our name was finally called, or whispered more like, we went down the corridor only to find it was empty. Asked the receptionist if name had been called and she said ""might have"" and told us to go back and sit down. Half an hour later our name was called again, went down the same corridor and again nobody was there! Went to ask the receptionist what was happening and she rudely asked us ""Do you know how many times we've been calling you? We've been shouting your name out!"" Which is completely untrue! We were sat directly in front of her and at no point did she say call our names! I calmly explained this to her and she then changed her mind and said that we were told to wait on the ""red seats"", I told her that nobody had told us at which point she kept insisting she had. She then said it was too late now and the doctor would not see us and would be going home immediately. She said we would have to book into A&E instead now, but surely that's what we did in the first place, having walked into the A&E department! Left straight away and went to QE Hospital which is a million times better and where we were treated with respect and kindness by staff. I have nothing to say about the medical staff as we were unable to even see them but the receptionist was extremely rude and I would definitely not recommend the A&E department   unless you want to be treated like trash and called a liar by the receptionist!",1
"Overhall update crying out for pulling down but central use it for public cash extraction to local metropolitan council.
The dirty smell of urine blocked broken stack sewage pipes running through the AE Department.
Which I think has the mock on effects to the doctor's and nurses that are either high on morphine's from there cabinets or so stoned from the local junior gp bringing in his new grades of hemp.
Ambulance staff are nice as long as you facing them, while GPS male and female struggle to keep up with the influx of Stray Dee's from just around the corner of the ghetto hospital uncomplex, complex.
The gentrification of the area speaks multi millios in the metropolitan councils ""Brick mansions"" style partizan efforts to blight and subtract all the possible positive energy from the area right up into there banky notes nestled in there accounts for further money cash developments.

Positive. A job for a spanked out gp or rehabilitation junior gps. A walk not too far out the ghetto...",1
"Had Surgery Here, Surgery went Well So 5*",5
My Son was delivered 6 weeks early in this hospital after i nearly lost both him and my wife due to wife having eclampsia. Other complications came up after the birth for my wife and the doctors and nurses where world class all through this. The facilities are equally great and i have only but praise for this hospital.,5
"Not sure anyone likes going to the hospital, but every time I go the car park prices go up further. The waiting times to see anyone are absurd and I've got to say the public health service although free of charge is shocking in this country. The City Hospital does nothing to help you quickly. I saw a girl collapse in the waiting room of the accident and emergency department. It was only with the help of an off duty nurse from a local surgery that they manage to take care of her.

Shocking, appalling and dreadful. Think of any words that go with this theme and that sums up the NHS and the City Hospital.",1
"It’s one of the worst hospital ever, if you’re going there to for a labour please please please save yourself, they are very inexperience, after birth nurses were very helpful and kind. Just labour you will regret badly. Please go to queens hospital. Would not recommend city hospital. Thank you.",1
"I am pregnant in 39 weeks and 2 days now and yesterday I've been sent by the midwife for an assessment because i have a bad edema all my body is swollen and the headaches are stronger every single day. And they kept in one uncomfortable chair for 3 hours, then when i let them know that i cant stay any longer in the same position because i couldn't feel my back and my body becomes more and more swollen, their response was that they can't do anything and that i need to wait. I asked them for my book and i went back home and they said in case i feel worst to call.. really????? And surprise today my feet became even bigger than yesterday and even my eyelids are swollen too but seems like nobody cares. Tomorrow I'll try to contact the manager or somebody because i can't believe this... i forgot to mention that i am a qualified nurse and i had really bad problems with the pregnancy.",1
"A complete shambles, a three hour wait for a pre booked appointment, staff untrained on computer systems, staff arguing among themselves in front of patients, and entering wrong information in to the system regarding patients allergies before surgery, and mixing up patients information. No communication to patients regarding waiting times or procedures.",1
"This compliment is directed at a lovely young lady who I spoke to last week in appointments at City. Namely Keiran.
I was desperate to see Mr Pravin Pandey as soon as possible. I had been out of the country when I should have seen the gentleman in February and had kept the medical secretaries/hospital appointment depatments up to date with that.
I had been back 2 weeks and tried to set up the overdue appointment. No one seemed too bothered but they had not got glaucoma and did not understand how frustrating it is not to be taken seriously. I was told I was due an appointment in May!
I can't fault the medical staff over the last few years in all NHS departments but the apathy shown by a lot of ""managers"" and other clerical staff leave a lot to be desired.
That is till I spoke to Keiran who was very professional and promised me she would follow it through for me and if i heard nothing to call her back. Well I finally have now received my appointment. Thank you Keiran for caring.
Please note those of you in charge how she is a credit to the failing health service.
You are a star Keiran.Thank you.  You set a perfect example of how the public would like to be treated.

"Went here today in agony with something my GP should have diagnosed and treated. I felt a bit of a fraud knowing I could have again return to the GP to be dismissed as making a bit too much of a fuss. I saw several people here and was listened to, respected and treated very professionally. I have a diagnosis now and recommendations to my GP for 2 sepetate referrals for a nasty condition. My GP had done nothing to ease my pain but City Hospital, particularly Mailing GPS and AMMA  ward have basically done my GPS job. You are brilliant. Thank you.",5
Today I went to A&E and I received  quick & good service .I arrived at 09:30 am seen by front line and  shortly was taken by Dr and  after 10:35 am was done and ready to go  .I did a minor surgery as I have been in terrible pains for months.I was worried due to the bad service from reviews ... But hey I believe it depends to the stuff on that particular shift.,4

"Absolutely horrific skills. Have been sat waiting for 7 hours without being seen. Yesterday I was here for 13 hours and Friday I was there for 6. IVE BEEN CLASSED AS AN EMERGENCY. There is a man screaming in pain and nobody, non of the nurses are seeing to him. It's an absolute shambles.",1
Always a busy place not many toilets. Staff are friendly and polite and helpful. Car parking was free today for some unknown reason you normally at to pay. Not many disabled parking spaces only by the main entrance. Not by outpatients departments.,3
"My sister visited city a &e department saturday becus she had lots of muscular pain after accupunture becus she has 2 slipped disks to improve pain.her body rejects all pain killers so she was in lot of pain. Went to a & e to get some help. They were really bad, went by ambulance and doctor came to see her after 3 hrs and discharged her as he cudnt give anything stronger for home and cant keep her in hospital becus its not very serious. Way bak her blood pressure went down and ambulance took bak again. This time they told her to go and wait in waitig room . She argued she cant sit becus her pain gets really bad by sitting. But they didnt listen. So she left hospital and came home and was in lot of pain and crying. We were disappointed with city hispital.",1
"MOST staff are passionate and work hard. I just wish the government would wake up and sort out major issues such as hospital beds instead of Brexit... my mum, 74 years of age,  waited on a metal chair for 5 hours before her bloods were taken - this was with a suspected heart attack!  Simply shameful what the nhs has come to.",2
"Surprised to see lady sitting at reception is laughing and making wired faces after listening to patient's problem.  This is really rude.
She is making fun of people with her other colleague sitting at reception. She should be trained to be nice to people rather making fun of patient's disease.",1
"My pregnant wife with hyperemesis gravidarum had to wait 4 hours in que ? She was exhausted, vomiting every 3-5 minutes, in a 4 hours queue ? This is the biggest joke I've ever seen ! I think you have one of the biggest budget for hospitals in EU and you have to wait 4 hours for an ""emergency"". Well done!",1
"Terrible. Was not told anything after surgery, nurses didn't seem to want to explain anything was snapped at when I asked what my pills were for after not having any and being hooked up to morphine. Wasnt given any  advice or after care instructions for when I went home had to explain to the trainiees how to attach night bag to catheter as they didnt know also had to explain to nurses why I had tube in my stomach and they didn't even have my name on the board so was being constantly asked what's your name. feel deeply let down.  Not even examined or asked how I was feeling on my return to have catheter removed luckily the cancer nurse was there to examine me which resulted in having my stitches out early due to irritation.  Would not recommend this hospital.",1
"This hospital is fu***n mental, few years ago i had both of my hands burned with cooking oil and not only i had to wait like 2-3 hours but the nurse that was checking me out said that she wont touch me because i didnt have my gp at the time so she literally said that she wont touch me because i may have ebola, cholera or other sickness like this. today my dads knee cap popped out and guess fu***n what ! they did not get him home he had to go for a 1 hour walk straight from the hospital because they did not get him home what the actual f**k ! its disgusting, the first time i saw my dad crying from agony. it should be shut down",1
"Had a pretty gnarly bite wound, rocked up at 11pm, left just over an hour later, all cleared up and with a box of antibiotics. Incredible care from start to finish.",5
The blood test staff was very rude and unprofessional. I taket my 4 year old son. They teared him unacceptably way that they make me cry. I will never ever take my child again in that horrible place.,1
"7 years ago i was diagnosed with breast cancer. I attended the Birmingham Treatment Centre attached to City Hospital for my chemo' & ops etc & i still go for check ups every year or two. I went at least once every 3 weeks for various treatments for over a year. Everyone in the breast clinic & oncology were fantastic, my oncologist Dr. Rea, the chemo' nurses, my surgeon Mr. Brown, everyone. I cannot fault them. I may have had to wait beyond my appointment times and i did see one registrar once that i wasn't too happy with but it was soon sorted, but hey, they're small prices to pay. I'M ALIVE 😀.",5
"Absolutely disgusting maternity staff. They’ve really scarred my experience of birth as they neglected and spoke down to me.

Miscommunication between the team of midwives. When asked for a complaints form twice, I never received one. When discussing my discomfort with the team, midwives would take it unprofessionally.",1
"Signage wasn't brilliant and I ended up in a different building rather than the department needed. Staff were helpful and guided me.
During tests staff were reassuring and explained process.",5
"Major problem with waiting time because of shortage of doctors and nurses. Waiting time between 3 to 6 hours it is utterly disgraceful for the NHS accident and emergency.
The NHS is no longer how it used to be, Teresa May you should be ashamed, look what you have done with the NHS that many patients rely on.
I can understand shortage of doctors or nurses but when there is an emergency of a patient atleast a nurse should attend to the patient for reassurance of how serious the condition of the patient is then a doctor should attend if its an emergency or wait until your turn.",1
"Worst experience ive ever had with Dr.'s or hospitals . After being there I realised that I am scared to even get ill. I had terrible pain, I nearly passed out from it and ambulance that came to my house was just unprofessional,rude and asked my house mate to find her own pills, because they didn't even have paracetamol with them. I had dangerous low blood pressure, couldn speak and when i was transfered to hospital i was waiting for 5 hours to someone come and see me. All they did was took blood test and said that now i am better and if i have any further problems i have to see my gp because they can't help me. That was worst than hell i swear. So unprofessional, I am scared to think what they do with people that are on the boarder to death.",1
Visited the a&e cause my girlfriend was having a massive rush all over her body and she had a burning sensation all over her body not knowing if was something very serious. Arrived at midnight and until four am although the waiting area was empty we were still waiting for nothing hoping to be called. Disgusting and unprofessional . Why do we pay taxes. On the other hand I thank the queen Elizabeth hospital for their professionalism .,1
"I have been calling for over 1hr!!!!!!!
Patients cannot talk to family members as there is no public telephone for patients to use!!!!!
The staff are rude and disrespectful...I just hope they are looking after my uncle properly!!!!😤😤😤😤
I really hate this public service hospital...they do not know how to serve or care for people at all😡😡😡
I pray for my uncles safety while he is there!
He would be better off at my house😡",1
a very good place and all the staff are looking after my mom very well. thank you :) also i was born there so has to be good. it has massively improved tho cuz when i was born they said i was going to be a dwarf and going to have loads of health problems but i have never had a health problem in my life,5
Absolutely shameful behaviour from reception lady berrnedette Finn who shouted and threatened my friend who had to take me to hospital extremely unprofessional behaviour was left in the waiting room bleeding heavily for. More then 3 and half hours the room I was finally taken to was dirty with blood left on the bed and floor and a used sanitary towel cover in blood left in the room staff were less then helpful and when we asked were the toilet was it was also covered in blood the doctor did not explain there diagnosis at all had to research on google absolutely horrible experience to the point even if I was dying I would not go here again well done nhs !,1
"AVOID IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIFE AND SANITY - they claim to be hospital bt htey could cause you to have a nervous break down. I was admitted here after having my son (and yes I appreciate that the NHS is free) but OMG!!!!
Though they claim to admit you in order to support you, they will reduce you to a nervous wreck in no time at all.
They do not have policies that make sense.  THere are notices saying 3 visitors per patient but people had in excess of 10 visitors at one time and the midwives said nothing. Apparently they are respecting other people's cultures in having lots of visitor etc but this is a medical ward. I am here to recover after a major operation. Culture does not come into this and the hospital using this as an excuse is appalling!!!!
The HCAs  are unbelievably rude - the one of my ward walked around like queen bee being rude to all and sundry. When I complained the response was ""that is how she is"" - becuse of course, that excuses her conduct.
Make sure your notes are correct too, a midwife claimed that I declined medication when in fact she had not offered it.
They have no care at all for the mental health of their patients, yes they have all these notices everywhere but they are not worth the paper they are printed on. The so called health professionals are playing both the arsonists and firemen.
AVOID THIS PLACE, IT IS A DEATH TRAP.",1
"I had an operation here yesterday and i just want to say the adult surgical unit on the 2nd floor of the Birmingham treatment centre really is a credit to the NHS. Each staff member that i saw couldn't of been anymore helpful even if they tried. I really do thank-you all, this was my first ever surgical  procedure so you can imagine the nerves. However with the staff being so professional, calming and caring I was so relaxed. I would highly recommend this unit and put anyone's mibd at ease who has future appointments here, your in safe hands here.",5
"Went to A&E on Wednesday with a potential miscarriage, waited 6hrs to be seen. People coming in hrs after me with minor cuts got seen within 45mins of coming. I mean God forbid anything should happen to their tiny cuts. Staff are unhelpful. Place is filthy and every part of the hospital, whether its A&E, the Sheldon block or the area where they finally examined me stunk of urine. I should have gone back to the early pregnancy unit, however after my experience there I have no faith that they have my unborn child's welfare in mind and do not believe we would have been adequately looked after, so ran to my Drs today and demanded a change over referral to BWH. CITY HOSPITAL NEEDS TO BE CLOSED DOWN! Urine, vomit, beer and rubbish all over the floor. Disgusting place",1
I was in sooooooo muchhhhhh pain in my right eye and can't see much out of my left due to a small stroke and needed help and they were fantastic seen me in half an hour and gave me eye drops which the chemist refused to do as my health is complicated with all the medicines I'm taking thanks for your help and support 🙂 ttxxxxxxx 😘 xxxxxxx,5
"Excellent hospital and specially the staff, they are so good with their work and professional, really kind and lovely staff.",5
Good amount of reasonable priced parking.  Staff helpful and usually polite.  Good service.  Toilets and coffee shop facilities on site.,4
Spent a week on the wards and have to say the quality of care was excellent. Old building but no complaints on any level.,5
Great staff. Work very hard and patients don't appreciate them!,5
"Wife gave birth at delivery suite the midwife & staff their were fantastic, as our child arrived a few days early. The staff checked on us regulary,  The reason for the one star is for Birmingham City Hospital labour ward,  the place you go one you leave the labour suite,

That place is absaloutly vile, my wife was transfered to the ward after her birth with our child, within moments they were telling to get on her feet change the babies nappie, feed the baby milk, despite them knowing my wife had just given birth, she had bleeding from giving birth grazes , tempreature, high blood pressure, could not walk,  shaky hands, she was on the end of the ward, they even told her to get out of bed & collect her own lunch if she was hungry.

Luckily me & my motherinlaw were there to assist her during the day. As the vile nurses didnt lift a finger to help her. Furthermother the labour delivery suite adviced my wife should not have the blood thinner injection straight away, as she was sore ,  they advised for a gap of 1 week,  but a nurse on the ward injected my wife whilst she protested.

If City Hospital trust are reading this i suggest you place your labour ward under special measures,  or replace it with adequte caring staff or close it down. So if your reading this dont go to city hospital labour ward. It is run like a prison.",1
"Horror services provided by the maternity sector , the worst medical experience wich we received in our live , I don t recommend it even if would be the last hospital in the world. And on the journeys wich we did to the hospital I was talking to the uber drivers wich were agreeing about the hospital's service. In my opinion something needs to be changed fast there.",1
"Although the wait times can build up due to demand I can say with an honest heart this is one hospital in the Midlands that cares and hope it stays that way. Doctors were eager to solve the problem and did the relevant checks to ensure health. It's run by empathetic human beings and needs to be praised for being the only hospital in Birmigham to achieve a good mark with CQC. Unlike heartlands which is inadequate and QE, Good Hope and Solihull all run by University Hospital.",4
"I received a first class treatment at this hospital about 2 years ago. The doctors and nurses were amazing, very caring, very thorough and efficient too.",5
Waited 4 hours plus for a simple check up. You are the world's slowest doctors and nurses,1
"Was in the A&E department then Amu department now in ladies ward...
What a fantastic service.. I am so proud that they are dedicated and kind... if you are nice to them they will be nice to you... most people think it's a holiday but need to realise they are here to get better..... I am so happy all the nurses and doctors have been amazing and kind.. they work such long hours... long hours... then there back again with a smile on there face.. they deserve a pay rise not stupid football players. People who save lives... so amazed.... well done dudley road hospital keep it up....",5
"I had the misfortune to visit A & E last week with my daughter and her baby. We were there for a considerable length of time so had to use the departments toilets. They were in an absolute disgusting state, stunk of the urine on the floors, paper towels strewn all over the place and none to wipe your hands on. Now I know the state of these facilities are not the fault of the trust but the dirty scutters which don't know how to use a loo but for Gods sake there needs to be more visits by the cleaner PLEASE!!",1
Happy happy happy mom was taken ill from work.we had never been to this hospital before. They look after all of us they all work so hard. You are in safe hands at this hospital for sure.unlike some of the others.,5
"Two words absolutely disgusting. I'd Had a seizure and was awoken rudely by this small Japanese doctor slapping my arms and legs to  wake me up saying I was pretending to be sleeping and there is nothing wrong with me, the bloody ambulance crew brought me in after I told them not to because I'd heard of.this shithole. They was discussing me like I wasn't even existing with the curtains wide open in triage no privacy whatsoever then the Japanese nurse said to a white female nurse you go sort her out because I can't be arsed nomore I must of drifted back off then again woke to slapping on my arms telling me I got to go wait In reception or they'll get security I got treated like a criminal and an animal they were truly uncaring and unprofessional. I advise noone if can be helped to go there. Appalling and disgusting behaviour from them. I hated every minute being there",1
Worn out hospital thats been modernised in stages. It can feel one minute like youre in call the midwife then suddenly in the most modern hospital ward in the country. Roll on its replacement.,2
"Old building, staff seem stressed and unmotivated to help.",2
"THE WORST HOSPITAL I HAVE EVER BEEN IN!!

Rang after having eye troubles throughout the night, so rang the hospital reception to see what was the best route to come in to the walk in eye center, to which i was advised to go to A&E where i would be referred to the eye clinic itself once i had been seen in triage.

So off i went to A&E where i sat for 3 hours before been seen, a wait time I would expect If it was busy, but with only 3 other people in the waiting room i found this only to be ridiculous. after asking the receptionist how long I would be waiting for going in to my 3rd hour, she advised that I was waiting for the eye center to open at 8.30 before i was to been seen.

I was then seen but what i can only assume was a doctor, who seemed to only make out that i was something of a pleb and gave me eye drops that i already had with me. I was then advised that if i wanted my eye examined correctly that i would have to go and check in at the eye clinic and wait in a further que.

After this whole experience I now understand why the hospital is so slated, with no staff training or knowledge of their own departments and doctors treating you like your an obstruction in their day, how can a hospital be run so badly?

The only person who seemed to have any kindness or personality was the women who checked me in at 4am in the morning.

I am in shock that it is this sort of service to which my taxes support.",1
"Very clean, nice hospital",5
"Visited the Eye department. Excellent service every time we visit. Pleasant, helpful staff. Amazing knowledge and skills by the surgeons and truly dedicated staff.",5
"Was with my 5 year old daughter admitted on Thursday for tonsilectomy . Outstanding service at the children' s  day surgery unit.  Everybody exceptionally kind and caring. From reception desk,  nursing staff,domestic staff, childrens play staff, theatre staff all amazing. Special thanks to   nurse Sue Woodridge ( I think that is her name) , and a young student nurse sorry l dont remember her name.
You all are an amazing team and have made a worrying time ok for us.",5
"The worst hospital ever doctors are very rude and not qualified qualified at all.
I have been waiting for a help for more than 5 hours today and the first thing I heard from doctors was you know what GP IS. Staff very rude, not helpful at all. Doctors seem to me like they don't know what to do to do. Shamans not doctors that how we should call them. Hopefully never going back there.. I put 1 star cause there is no option to give 0.",1
"I’ve been to the city on several occasions over the years, & have had mostly bad experience of this God forsaken hole. It’s like being in a horror movie where they're all in some sort of catatonic state.  Hardly anyone is approachable, & you can see the fear in their eyes if you attempt eye contact, or dare ask them anything.  Of course whatever you want the nurses are always busy, that is busy chatting amongst themselves, & the subject won’t be you.
This, is a career, that they choose, I know we all have bad days but my God these people treat us like we shouldn’t be on the face of this earth! There are some really lovely staff here, & for that I’m so grateful. All we sometimes need is a smile, or a friendly few words to make us feel good, but even this seems too much to ask for.  Until the new hospital’s built I’ll have to keep returning here, but I think I’d rather die than have to go back to the City Hospital in Birmingham.",1
Can not fault the midwifes or sergeon staff at all they were amazing when i went in to have my son. They looked after us really well. But a massive thankyou to emi and pam the 2 midwifes who stood out more due to how outstanding they were towards me :),5
"From our experience I don't know why people moan. Staff at eye centre and amu 1 & 2 have been absolutely brilliant. The stuff those guys have to deal with and some of the abuse, people should be ashamed of themselves. Hats off to all of you, your work is appreciated by many.",5
I booked there on A&E thinking that they would help soon as possibile my wife because she got severe pain but they said that she needed to wait to for 3 hours. The staff showing no interest.This is just disappointing on people in need getting no help in time.,1
"Went tonight really sick. Receptionist on Emergency department it’s so impolite the correct word is disgusting. I presume she is wrong on there, she think it is a concurs of miss world!

"I have been a patient at the Rheumatology Dept for the last nine years.
I have nothing but admiration for Dr. David Carruthers  and his medical team.
My diagnosis was made very quickly, and I was put on medication there and then.
His department is well run, well organised,very clean and the staff are all friendly and helpful.
If you need treatment ,you will be in very good hands.",5
"Stop the institutional abuse towards patients who come in for treatment. As a care professional, you are to show care and empathy and not that sour looking face as though you are in a war zone. Admit your mistake  and apologise.rather than been defensive. Hca,  nurses acting as  tin gods, and if you were the doctors or surgeons, then every patients would have been dead and forgotten.
Be civil and be nice and stop scaring the children who come to your ward, because they can see that sour face of yours.
This is for the children outpatient, some bad eggs are giving the rest of you bad name.",1
"Hospital is absolutely massive with so many different buildings, it’s not easy to find your way around. Parking as a joke as there seems to be spaces but you can’t park there.",2

"Amazing care for my dad in AMU 2 and A & E.

The pressure on staff is palpable and they keep on going on. True Angels of our earth.",5

"Have been trying to get my mum urgent  blood tests done, her GP practice could not fit her in. So rang City Hospital spoke to a receptionist asking, if I could bring the hospital letter in which details bloods that need to be done.

"1 was just because i found parking the staff show you no sympathy like they where forced to work long hours.

Twice the doctor has sent him away with treatment and telling him he wants to see him in 3 weeks, but because of there ridiculous appointment system they keep failing to send him an appointment.

No long queue, I come a bit early from my appointment time.
There is good waiting area for patients, toilets and accessible toilet available in the waiting area.
Vendors available out side the MRI & CT Scan Department, just in the main entrance of City Hospital.
I been told, City Hospital will move to the new hospital Midland Metropolitan University Hospital by the end of October or early November this year 2024.",5

Beautiful,5
Absolutely superb experience having a c section at heartlands the level of care from every staff member was  amazing. I felt very well supported. A part of me was sad to leave when I went home with my beautiful baby girl.,5
"Once again, the hospital has turned up trumps. Through no fault of its own, other nearby hospitals have had A&E Departments ridiculously closed. This has put a great deal of pressure on Heartlands Hospital. Several members of our family have had wonderful treatment there, for which we will always be grateful.",5
"It would be nice to add the Ukrainian language when registering at the registration station. The doctor was waiting for an hour today. He never came, they sent a replacement. It is difficult to find the right section on your own, there are no signs, you just need to ask.

From the station it is easy to reach by bus number 97",2
"Abysmal hospital. Parking an absolute nightmare. Could they make it any more difficult for disabled patients to access the diabetic clinic at the back? After several fire doors you are forced to go outside, in the road, uphill, up and down kerbs, it is disgusting! Wait times at A&E are up there with worst in the country. Would much rather suffer at home ...

** Only credit goes to the nurses and doctors at the diabetic and endocrine dept. All of them there have been a pleasure to know over the years. 10/10",1
"Ward 18 it’s a disaster zone extremely short staffed no communication at all , staff completely ran off there feet . Patients ask for help in getting comfortable in bed or the chair takes ages before they are looked after . My mother waited for 90 minutes to be put back in bed , as she was in pain from her hip surgery. Staff don’t listen to relatives requests . It’s overwhelmingly obvious the challenge is to keep beds free no duty of care shown to patient and family. Don’t see consultants or drs for updates . Any info comes from the nurses and then they don’t know the full story .
If you read this and your relative in in ward 18 watch over them like a hawk",1
"Overrun with nurses and no doctors
Awful experience.  Arrived at 8am.  Firstly was told by Urgent Care at 9.30am that I HAVE to be assessed and show evidence before being admitted to gynae department as ‘they will go mad if we haven’t ruled anything out before sending you up there’.  Wow, just wow.
Once the doctor saw me at first assessment she asked why I wasn’t sent straight to gynae as it’s an obvious gynae problem.
3pm:  sitting in GAU, urine sample given, result=dehydration.  I’ve been in this department 5hrs and have not been offered any water nor is there any available in the waiting room.  In fact, I’ve been in this hospital  12hrs and counting and have not been offered a drink of water once.  I haven’t eaten for over 24hrs and am still here waiting for medication.  Urgent care department is the worst department here and u can't complain about the doctor as they’re relief docs and no one knows their names.",1
"Was taken here for my young children who needed urgernt care whilst we was visiting family.
The Children's A&E department was absolutely fantastic, so caring and attentive. They have a play specialist for the kids which I think is amazing and so helpful when it comes to children needing to have tests done and checks. They made sure we all got something to eat and drink before we left. Couldn't recommend this hospital more, was a lovely experience and I'm so thankful for the care we received",5
"I recently visited Birmingham Heartlands Hospital with great anticipation of receiving prompt medical attention for severe pain. However, my experience left me deeply disappointed and frustrated.

Upon arriving early in the morning, I had my blood samples taken, only to wait an excruciating 9 hours for the doctor’s examination. When my turn finally arrived, I was informed that my blood reports were missing. This lack of coordination and communication added to my distress.

Despite spending the entire day at the hospital, I wasn’t examined, and I left by choice without anyone acknowledging or addressing my concerns. The lack of support and the constant instruction to wait were disheartening, considering the severity of my pain.

Every month government deducts 1/3rd of my income on name of taxes and this inhumane treatment I got in return. Everyday I will curse you for this cruelty and may God destroy you.",1
"Subject: Concerns Regarding Heartland Hospital Services

Dear Sir/Madam,

I recently visited Heartland Hospital and regrettably encountered several disconcerting issues that I feel compelled to bring to your attention. The state of cleanliness and organization within the facility was substandard, notably due to the lack of proper maintenance and organization. Additionally, there appeared to be a shortage of medical staff, which exacerbated the extended waiting times.

The disregard for hygiene was particularly distressing, with unsanitary conditions prevailing in various areas. Instances of items strewn across the floor and unattended messes, including vomit in corridors, were observed. Moreover, the demeanor of some receptionists was discourteous, adding to the overall discomfort of the experience.

My primary reason for the visit was due to severe abdominal pain and vomiting, which led to a blood test indicating an infection. Despite this, the unavailability of immediate appointments for necessary ultrasound tests resulted in a delay in further diagnosis and treatment. This delay has caused me significant discomfort and concern.

Comparatively, in Belgium, where I previously resided, a monthly healthcare contribution of 30 pounds ensured access to hospitals with notably higher standards and more efficient services. Private healthcare options were available for a fee of 50 pounds, with partial reimbursement and reduced medication costs, offering expedited and more satisfactory care.

I write this correspondence amidst discomfort and distress, emphasizing the urgency to address these critical shortcomings within Heartland Hospital. Immediate attention to these issues is imperative to enhance the quality of care and restore confidence in the hospital's services.

Sincerely,",1
"I wish Google introduced 0 star rating so first 0 star from me goes to HEARTLAND HOSPITAL.
No one visit any Hospital happily ,everyone there came for a reason to come.Our personal experience as member of general public is Absolutely disappointed. When my elder son was born the Hospital knows previous health history of my Mrs.She have blood pressure issue. During labour she continuously telling nurses I need fresh air I am suffocating due to high temperature in the room which they ignore numerous times.
Cut the story short which triger her high blood pressure 160 and entire prince of wales Doctors gather in her room.
They let us bring fan after admitting their mistake and shift us in private room and we stayed in hospital after birth for 12 days. If anything goes wrong on that day who was responsible nurses simply says Its because of anxiety and stress which causes high blood pressure. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE from nurses.
So considering our previous experience we have decided NOT to choose this horrible hospital for our next baby.My young son was born in hayes Hospital London absolutely amazing experience wonderful cooperative nurses.
Please NOT choose this hospital for maternity,  Womens Hospital next to QE is far better well behaved staff and nurses.

A&E experience is not the great as well minimum waiting time 5-6 hours.
Now they have squeezed the parking spaces as well .The scale of the Hospital is huge but management is Not good.",1
"The place seems to operate on a can't be bothered to do anything, can't be bothered to repair anything, can't be bothered to operate anything like even as simple as their grotty café which shuts at 3pm at the weekend.  Never seen so many unhappy surly staff who sit around phone scrolling or force feeding themselves with fattening foods in one organisation.  They can't even operate their car parks and payment machines usually with 2 out of three broken.",1
"Staying in ward 5 and I can hand on heart say everyone is brilliant here but one person stood out like a shining star her name is nurse Margery ( I hope u spelt the name right)so caring and understanding and always there with a smile, I also witnessed her attending other patients who would have been very difficult to control in such a brilliant and kind way that I was amazed! Brilliant nurse! You have a gem there Heartlands hospital ward 5 night shift!",5
'Heartless Hospital'Shocking wait times and lack of empathy from all staff at Heartlands Hospital A&E! .. a senior lady was waiting for 9hrs+ to see the doctor from 6 pm/3am! Disgusting. The NHS falls further down the shi hole.,1
Absolutely appalled by the staff at this hospital. None of them are nice at all. Car parking is an absolute joke. You got cars parked everywhere. On grass verges. Along side of the cars which are in bays making it a struggle to drive around. Pay machines take coins only so why not make them take card payments aswell? It would make life much easier for car users. Make it make sense what a shambles,1
Some nurses here do not deserve to call themselves nurses they do not care at all extremely rude and unprofessional especially at a&e. Nurses think they know more than doctors and turn people down here without them even seeing a doctor. Heart breaking makes me cry to be honest,1
"It was a horrible experience one of my relatives was admitted there in princess of wale women's unit heartland hospital birmingham.so the time was arround 2 to 3 o clock on 25th of January. Actually its not a hearland but a heartless hospital .The pregnant woman was in pain her labour cramps were started but the heartless and merciless staff left her bearing the pain alone at hospital she was wating at home earlier for their call but they kept ignoring her and her pain.
she almost was dying in pain but she was not called by the unprofessional staff. she was told to wait nothing will happen when she couldnt tolerate the pain anymore she left for the hospital. Again the staff treated her so badly they are so ignorent she was left waiting on a chair with dying labour pains she cried for help no one was ready to hear she was on bed suddenly the water bag broke she was told to get up and not to worry nothing would  happen but she was in so much pain she couldnt move then an other staff lady came to check her and saw that baby is comimg out  then she told their idle staff to  rush to the labour room.can anyone tell is it a treatment that a human being should be given? Is it what you call a  civilised society? Is it a professionalism? So inhuman she even was not given an injection for this called epidural to numb the treatment pains
I wanna call an attention for authority to check this inhuman behaviour towards pregnant ladies by this hospital.treat them like humans.you call yourself a cvilised and human friendly people. Is this humanity?  What a shame.",1
Can't say a bad word about the treatment that i was given in this hospital been in their two times the first time was over a year ago when I was in their for seven weeks and I had to go back for another 5 weeks a year later with the same problem and the staff are absolutely brilliant and the way they treated me was fantastic and I will never forget about those nurses and all the other people on the ward I've never been in hospital for a illness before never been ill and you always hear other people that say how bad heartlands hospital is and the terrible experience they had with the hospital but I can only speak for myself and say I was treated with kindness and respect and the nurses would go above and beyond to help you so don't listen to them people who say it's a bad place because it's far from that they are doing a great job in a busy hospital 🏥 and my love goes out to all the staff on the cardiac ward,2
"I would just like to say that I was rushed in to heartlands hospital last week  from good Hope hospital due to cardiac arrest, they wasted no time on operating on me as i had two closed arteries. then I was put on ward 6 for 3 days where I must say that the nurses and doctors were exceptional  and I knew i was in very capable hands I would like to thank all the staff regards David",5
"If I could give 0 stars I would.
This hospital already has a poor reputation and when visiting yesterday I could straightaway see why.
The receptionist are rude and unprofessional. And they're all so miserable.
I only met one good person in passing and he was a doctor.",1
"Hate hospitals, went as was struggling to breathe. Was left there sitting on an uncomfortable chair in a crowded room gasping for breath and told minimum 6 hour wait. They did a roll call and there were over 40 patients waiting to be seen. Ended up walking out. May aswell gasp in comfort in my own home. Managed to get a doctors appointment the following day.",1
"From the 999 call all the way through to my mom's admission, ever single member of staff has been amazing.  The paramedics,  the doctors and nurses, the cleaners and volunteers have all been amazing. Kind, caring
and helpful",5
"My husband is currently in hospital here. He is immunocompromised and suffering with pneumonia. I have nothing but praise for all the staff who have cared for him from the point he was admitted 11 days ago. He is making great progress. His sister has visited several times, she is a retired nurse specialist and CQC inspector and is very impressed with the care he has received and how well run the wards are. In these times when the NHS is so stretched we should all be extremely thankful that they are there for us!",5
"Sharon, in Maternity, wears a headscarf and a stinking attitude, cuts her dirty looks, looks you up and down like you're lower than her, barked orders at me instead of speaking to me with decency, i dont know who she thinks she is but she shouldnt work in a Maternity unit, which is packed with fragile ladies and anxious family who would be everso greatful for a midwife who made us feel at ease instead of on edge and insignificant, what was a very stressful and frightening time for my 18yr old daughter and her partner and me was made even worse with her rude and disrespectful manner, you have no right to treat and make ppl feel the way you did that night, you should be ashamed of yourself, i wasnt allowed to sit with my girl while she was suspectedof going into early labour, no, i was given my marching orders and told to sit outside, even closing the assessment waiting room doors so i couldnt have any eye contact with my girl. While stood with a couple of others outside having a cig you came to the door, hands on hips, singling me out and told to move from the doors, which I get, but only I was told and with such disgusting and arrogant mannor, my daughter is heavily pregnant with high anxiety and is on the spectrum, so of you're reading this Sharon I suggest you take some humanity classes, and remember that you don't know what someone is going through, have some respect, because you wouldn't like someone treating you and your daughter in the way you treated us, i went home early hours  such an emotional wreck. Had to keep strong for my girl while you made us feel like we were such an inconvenience, .. I had 2 of my kids here, was fantastic, you disgrace yourself with the standards you've lowered to...",1
"facilities were good but there greedy, they let cars in the carpark thats full to just drive around until a space becomes free causing ques, to top it off they charge £5.10 for 4 hours yet have no pay machines working causing a long line of over 50 people in minus weather making me late for the school run. make all this money jamming the car park to the brim yet cant afford to fix pay machines. Very long waiting times aswel",1
"If I could give give this hospital zero stars I would. I came to the A&E due to having an inflamed foot which I was informed needed to be looked at immediately due to risks of infection. Not only did I struggle to get to the entrance due to there not being any wheelchairs available (None of the staff wanted to get them from the back) but I was rudely told to wait in the seating area with the rest of the patients.

The seating area they sent us to was another building which was difficult for me to get to since I couldn't walk. After 1 hour my mum had enquired to the reception about the waiting time and after checking their system, it was found they had sent me to the wrong building.

After getting to the right building (same building I came to first) 4 and a half hours pass and my foot had gotten worse, my mum had told the reception but was rudely told off by the receptionist because apparently she was being aggressive, despite all she was asking was for how much longer till I get seen as my condition wasn't good.

Overall my foot had gotten worse due to the waiting and all I could think about is the mis manegment and rude staff me and my mum had to contend with especially when I had a condition that prevented me from walking.

My advice stay away from this hospital.",1
If 0 stars were available that’s exactly what I’d give. Parking is atrocious. People are parked on the edges of parking rows making it ridiculously tight to get round. The one way system is a joke and doesn’t work at all no where near enough parking and the fact you have to pay to drive around for over an hour looking for somewhere to park is disgusting. AVOID DRIVING AT ALL COSTS. Causes way to much stress and agro.,1
"As the saying goes 'if there was hell on earth' - heartlands hospital would definitely be it.

As many comments and reviews have already noted this hospital is the worst hospital in the United Kingdom.

The standard of care is atrocious and this is mainly to do with the lack of funding the NHS is receiving from central government. In addition to this, staff I.e. some nurses let the hospital down by having a lazy work ethic (although the vast majority are very hard working).

The biggest issue is the waste times, if you want to wait 24+ hrs to be seen come here. If not go to the QE where 9 times out of 10 the care is exceptional.",1
"Hi I am David Wootton  , luke Woottons  father and I had to have my 2nd angiogram as an outpatient at heartlands hospital , once again the level of care by the nurses and cardiologists were 2nd to none   , ward 6 is amazing     Regards David.",5
Got to be the worst hospital on planet earth . Waiting times are shocking . Expect to wait 5 hours just to be told something you could have literally googled . Staff are rude and too busy checking their social media pages . I got seen by a so called Romanian doctor who could barely speak English and didn't have a clue what was going on . God knows where they getting the qualifications for a job so important.  Stay clear better to go Queen Elizabeth or elsewhere . No compassion no respect and an absolute shocking customer service . Worst of the worst,1
"The dirtiest hospital on the planet. Putting people on beds still with blood on from the last person; the staff are so fed up they talk to you like your dog mess. No hand sanitiser anywhere, very very dirty in there; its disgusting. The state of the floors &walls, blood and spit in the corners of the rooms. I have an amputation and asked for some cleaning wipes and a bandage,after an hour of being ignored and told the same thing I had to discharge myself and go to QE Hospital, just to try and get some help.
To be honest and it is honest, the staff shouldn't be getting paid they need to understand manners and what the word hygiene means.
Really disgusting in there, after dealing with one person they look at another but don't wash hands, come on that should be standard, why are they not even washing 🤔",1
"Right …this is a review to applause the incredible receptionist ,nurses and the doctors who were oncall at heartland hospital children A&E on the 23rd of September. The NHS is in crisis, yes it’s underfunded, yes but the most valuable asset of the NHS is those amazing people who spend their nights saving lives and heartlands paediatrics AE staff without a doubt are a life saver.
The service is incredible the AE reception is a bit tight but it’s spotless.
Waiting is another thing people wing about but it’s a fact of life !
Couldn’t thank you enough for looking after my little one,you are all amazing .
Thank you heartlands AE.",5
"Unnecessary delays, no communications from staff, badly run, waste of resources,inefficient run. No accountability. Complaints not taken seriously. We have no alternatives but to use them when we need to. My 82 year old mother waited 22 hours at A& E waiting room to be told to go home with some tablets. In all honesty could have been treated with the GP if we could have got an appointment.",2
"The Heartlands hospital endoscopy unit:
I like to send my gratitude to the heartlands hospital and in particular to the endoscopy unit, I’ve just had a difficult procedure carried out today at the endoscopy unit and I have to send my many thanks to the nurses and especially to the doctor who performed this procedure, you are all amazing and for that I’m so very grateful, and thank you all for bringing your valuable experience and devotion to our wonderful NHS..   E.Boland",5
"I gave birth to my son at Heartlands on 3rd July. The staff were very attentive, supportive and caring. I was at the hospital for six days and I had a really good experience. The two nurses who helped me deliver my baby were absolutely incredible- Sahar and Lauren.",5
"Everything about this hospital is wrong from the top to bottom. I've never experienced such an awful awful place. I have seen so much incompetence and the cherry on the cake was being charged twice for the car park!!!
God help any one who has to go there either as a patient or visitor",1
I have spent 26 days on ward 20 the nurses are amazing well cared for nothing to much trouble it’s a same the nurses are run off there feet.over worked and under payed but they don’t complain as that’s the job they went in to care for ill people,5
I’m giving two stars only because of nurses who seem to do what they can. My husband had an appointment for 8am at treatment centre. 8 hours later he is STILL WAITING for his procedure! 8 hours and it’s not done yet! What’s the point of asking patient to come for designated time?,2
Ward 28a staff were wonderful to my husband during his stay and the end of life care that he received.  Particularly the Sisters who were so empathetic and always had time to speak to us.  You are all a credit to your profession. Thank you so much.,5
"Children's A and E
Thank-you for your help with our baby granddaughter. Good accessible process. Works well.",5
"5hit place for parking the staff behave has if your disturbing them in their private boudoir.The chairs dirty, sticky and nasty just sitting on them you'll catch a unknown disease. The out-patient department smells like a port-a-loo.",1
Eden suite team (baby loss) has been amazing from the start. They're still checking up 2 months later. Very understanding and empathetic. Couldn't think of a better team to have as support in such a difficult time.,5
I wouldn’t even give this hospital 1 star I have been diagnosed with blood clots last year I have been having on going pains they kept sending me the same day emergency care WARD 19 and they keep fobbing me off and I’m only getting worser and worser I do not recommend this hospital one bit they spoke behind my back while I was behind the nurse and hured everything they have said they ain’t taking me seriously because I’m 20 years old they just think I’m being dramatic with my pains my heart rate is high of 144 and my blood pressure is low 59/37 I nearly passed out and they still are fobbing me off home!!!!,1
ward 16 nurses are brilliant  unfortunately  the idiot security guard  mark was a idiot who shouldn't  be in a job there he was asked to raise the barrier for a child in wheelchair which he refused so the child had to be carried across the hosptail its a disgrace,2
"Excellent service yesterday & today during my overnight stay. From time of booking in to discharge this afternoon all staff/medics were lovely & kind. Thank you, your kindness & thoroughness of tests through to the appropriate treatment is much appreciated! Over 30 years ago medics saved my dad's life as he had a burst ulcer & 23 years ago the medics made my mum's last days as comfortable as possible & their kindness to our family helped us get through those very difficult days. Kindness is never ever forgotten & I thank you.",5
"This hospital has a bad reputation. it is known as the place you never wake up from or never see life or daylight again! my moms bestfriend died here 3 days ago she was pregnant with a blockage in her intestines and while in operation the baby died , but they left the baby in her and carried on operating on her , they should of taken the baby out first and then saved my moms friends life , because the baby died in her that is what caused her to die also as it caused shock to the body and also sepsis 😡 . staff clearly dont know what they are doing in this place! they must be feuding there certificates to get the job or something in this place as every friend ive had, has also been in this hospital and died! This place really needs shutting down your google reviews (2.9) says it all !!
please do not enter this hospital people !!! otherwise you will not ever see daylight again",1
"Would give 0 stars if I could.
Horrific experience too many issues to list, everything from clerical errors resulting in a critical scan being delayed to being questioned when checking on my very dear loved one and chasing constantly to find out answers to get no response No tact or sensitivity was shown on numerous occasion over the last 5 days. I am truly disgusted by the whole experience and extremely glad to have my loved one home so they can be cared for properly.",1
"Our first baby was born in the Princess of Wales unit at Heartlands last Friday. I cannot speak highly enough of the doctors, nurses, support staff and midwives there. My partner and baby received amazing care from all the staff. They were caring, attentive and clearly well trained. We will definitely have our second child there if we are lucky enough to have another.  A huge thank you to all on the maternity unit and in Cedar ward. X x Chris, Li-an and baby Ezra x x",5
"""Hi, I have been referred here from 111 because I am having trouble breathing from an allergic reaction,"" I say as i am gasping for air, sweating profusely

""Take a seat. It will be about an 8-hour wait."" The staff replies nonchalantly.

There's lots I could say about this particular visit, but this single answer alone explains what you can and should expect.",1
"From the minute the paramedics  brought me through the doors, I have received the most superb care and attention from every single staff member. It could not be faulted!!",5
What a brilliant hospital lovely and clean great staff parking no problem waiting time was fast lovely doctor biswas great experience,5
"A fat white girl ( just to describe the correct girl ) sitting in the reception of treatment centre with some snacks. Pretty rude and was using F word with someone while me and my mum were waiting for her look on us to ask her about something.
It's sad that just a single person can destroy the entire hospital experience.",2
"I had all my scans at good hope hospital and a planned C-section at heartlands.
I can honestly say it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. All the midwife, care assistant just everyone that I came into contact with at heartland's was beyond fantastic. Can really see they all cared deeply for their job and can honestly not thank them all enough 🙂 true hero's.",5
"Worst service for children’s care I’ve been here today for my little one. every nurse and doctors are very proud of them selves acting
so busy of doing nothing everyone is busy chatting in the corridor with each other. Not giving proper time to the patients.
I was sent to hospital by 111 the nurse said I don’t know as I know you should go and come back for a GP face-to-face. I’m not able to give you any medication and there’s no doctor and the doctors were talking with the receptionist and there were two other doctors standing and chatting with the nurses about their personal life which we all could hear them
The nurse who checked my daughter was very rude .
I think they are all here for time pass and salary not to offer a proper service in return of the money the get which is a shame .",1
Very dangerous hosptial  and extremely dangerous  security   staff including extremely inexperienced staff nurses doctors dealing with very  vulerable very patients   extremely hostile place also other patients who are not vulerable  put other vulnerable patient's  at massive risk !!,1
"I cant imagine how hard it is to work at a hospital, I know there are a lot of complaints but the staff I was given were absolutely fab, some lovely hard working people there",5
"Two parts to this.
5* for the support I received from some of the facilities (i think) employees. Chris was very kind and he walked me to the location.  I had been walking around for 40 minutes!  Thank you 😊

2* for the directions and available signage.  Even the department I called wrongly advised direction to their department.",3
"i was admitted yesterday the15th sept,i was there for several hours,
and i have to say all of the staff in A&E were absolutely marvellous,i couldnt have asked for anything more than these  lovely peolpe gave me,the caring and thoroughness by everyone.a big thankyou to all concerned .Elizabeth Lucas x",5
Worst experience of my life. Waited 6hrs in the waiting room and now 2 and half hours more and still waiting in sau ward. God knows how many hours we are gona be here yet,1
This place has gone down hill over last 10 to 15 years. Since I last came here. Definitely needs to be looked into by NHS. SMALL cramped up A and E waiting area. Was there few days ago with my mother. There was alot of old people in waiting area. No water at all. When I asked a staff she kept repeating that she just started her shift. Patients where being seen in same room as other patients. No privacy. Lot of reform needed in this place especially with the asian staff members who think their dad's own the hospital.,1
"Not impressed with Ward 1 staff who were all too happy to discharge a patient with severe chest and abdominal pain with the advice that ""if things get worse, come back to the hospital"", to which, 5 days later I was back in Heartlands A&E. When challenged on the criteria for being discharged, one nurse commented ""because the patient can use the toilet unassisted""

5 days later, I was on ward 19 where the staff were able to determine the root cause of the problem and apply treatment. Suffice to say, I am no longer in pain and am SOOO happy and thankful with the team on ward 19, where I didn't feel like a tick box.",3
"Where do you start..From not answering the phone to appalling care.Spent a few days now visiting a relative so witnessed a few things..From a old boy prob in his 90`s requesting help for the toilet from the person dressed in a nurses uniform,she started huffing and puffing to him about her break time, to another patient being so well looked after he pee`d in the sink in a open ward and none of the staff noticed..Then after being told it took them over 30 mins to sanitise it..The food is inedible for the first few days then as the patients starve they have no alternative but to eat it.My friend had a drip and after a few hours we noticed it wasnt going down.We questioned it which was met with a tutt and she fiddled with it and left.Still wasnt working one hour later and again we had to alert the staff...They couldn't care less...Everything is a chore to the staff .I say staff because i saw no actually nursing..When people say the nhs is under staffed i saw 9 staff members in the ward to 7 patients.....Also to many to count at the main desk....I had the misfortune to actually be a inmate 6 months ago for 24hrs and nothing has changed.And to think people actually clapped them..Bet that dont happen again any time soon.",1
"I blacked out on my way to the bus stop. I'm 17 weeks pregnant i went straight to the women's, I got checked over straight away, probably only waited 20 minutes then I went A nd E as advised and was seen too quite quickly. Several checks done. Was there for about 2 hours. Baby and myself are fine. It was just a drop in blood pressure.",4
Terrible service… I arrived and the waiting time was over 4 hours. Prior to that I visited a few days before for the same service and they told me to wait outside the hospital. They did that it would be a minimum of 7 hours for the waiting time. Horrendous experience even when I asked if they could tell me how long I should be expected to wait to be seen. They didn’t even acknowledge me shown such a lack or compassion  and empathy. Awful awful hospital. The service has gone down big time.,1
"I had day treatment here for urology, all of the staff from receptionists to surgeons were absolutely superb from start to finish a credit to the NHS. They work such long days, hats off to them.",5
"Very unprofessional nursing staff, badly managed from the top down with no duty of care for disabled, let patients out of hospital knowing they are ill, my wife subsequently passed.  Now I find my 94 year old father has been sitting on an ambulance after being blue lighted in beacuse of heart and chest problems for over 3 hours and counting.  unless you want to die avoid at all costs",1
"I could not have had a better experience if I had gone privately! When we arrived at the disabled car park the attendant was so kind and got us a spot as near as possible to the entrance. The sisters, doctors, porters, etc were wonderful. Brought us food and drink. So good I am going back for more today!",5
"Looked after me after surgery, can't really fault the nursing staff, so caring and extremely busy.",4
"The hospital and staff get a 5
but parking is terrible. The payment machines don't accept cards, but claim to accept cash, they machines are in very poor condition and don't inspire confidence.
So you join a long queue and pay a very slow man your parking fee.
Alow a few minutes for this because you might move into the next price level.
Like I did",1
"Can’t really fault hospital or staff who are doing a great job in hard times,……as for the parking which is an absolute joke and danger to life as it seems you can park where you like as long as you pay to get out and where are the people staffing this mess….sitting on backsides doing nothing to help the situation, not even a traffic warden…shameful and disgusting….",4
I am very disappointed with this hospital I've been waiting at the A&E for at least 9 hours in such a pain and in such difficult situation the nurses and the staff's are very rude don't even bother helping you I recommend all the patients who are suffering from any illnesses and having some major health problems do not go to Heartland Hospital!,1
"My dad was admitted recently into SAU unit after a mass was found in his bladder on a private scan. My mum wasn't allowed to be present. They delivered the news that it was cancerous without a family member present for support and in front of other patients on the unit. Absolutely disgusting treatment! I understand hospitals are short staffed and this is a normal working day for them but disgusted in the delivery of devastating news, lack of empathy and support. Then just waved on his way after the news. Should be ashamed",1
"What a place , A&E stunk of urine. Didn't realise it was a homeless doss house. Very disorganised and bad attitude from check in staff",1
"I came into heartlands hospital following a heart attack, cannot thank the staff, the doctor,s and nurse,s enough, they were brill thank you so so much for taking good care of me, up the NHS👍",5
"I was admitted after going to a and e a couple days ago and stayed overnight on ward 5 , the student nurses and healthcare assistants were amazing , they made my stay so much better and almost made me forget I was in hospital. However the nurses seemed very stressed and irritated and it was difficult to get their attention to the point where I almost self discharged. On the whole the students and hcas made my experience better.",3
They not paying attention in wards.. not enough halal food for muslims. Not clean n not paying attention on cleaning everyday n also responding very late on buzzers. Patients in pain n cry n they just being lazy to attend.,1
"This week I had to visit A& E and Cardiology. I must say the care that I received was second to none. The team as a whole carried out numerous tests and observations until they found the route of my problem. Nurses, Doctors and Porters were knowledgable, kind and caring. I was very impressed and I'm very grateful. Thank you all.",5
"Really really busy expect to be waiting 5-6 hours for anything!! Hope it will improve soon!!  But I won't hold my breath!! Update (8th Nov) it took almost 10 hours before a bed was found for my wife, issue was she is disabled can't transfer from her wheelchair there wasn't a hoist in the dept we were in, even if there was one there's not a room to clean & change a person! Isn't this discrimination against anyone that is disabled? My wife is now home after a small operation just spending 2 nights on a ward which I have no complaints whatsoever with her care from the staff apart they're overworked!",5
"Amazing staff couldn't do enough for my mom.
Parking a nightmare in the week but easy on the weekend",4
"I was diagnosed with throat cancer 5 years ago. The doctors seemed great at first, they rushed me in to start treatment,  I had six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at the QE . The treatment was very hard but efficient, I was told I'd be checked on every 3 months for the first 2 years then every 6 months from then for the next 5 years.  Since my treatment finished on the 5/04/18 I have been checked once , I've tried to get intouch with them with no joy. 5 years have nearly passed and I still don't know nothing,  do I still have cancer,  do I need anymore treatment, am I cured,  I don't know.  I just think it's very unfair to leave someone worrying for so long.",1
"The most horrible maternity. Unqualified doctors and bad activity system. 5 pregnant women waited more than 3 hours - to be seen by a doctor. For 3 hours no doctor came. 5 patients, no more!! I went with severe pain and was sent home, telling me that everything is fine. This cannot be tolerated, I will file a complaint.",1
"Really poor organisation, was sent an appointment ,consultant running 2 hours behind only to be told the appointment is for  after the scan but the scan hasn’t been processed yet.There were 4 more people in are block with the same out come .one lady has had her scan but returned to 2 appointments and the results aren’t back yet.What a waste of time and tax payers money. And why is a consultant booking appointments to tell people that they will have get a new appointment but it may happen again because the system isn’t linked to each other.
This costs us taxpayers hundreds of thousands  each day",1
Their service is terrible. One of the worst hospitals in Birmingham. Also when you cal the receptionists are so rude and always cut off the lines. Poor service all over,1
"WORST EVER HOSPITAL! My grandma got 10x worse while being admitted here. She was neglected there was no patient care from anyone in this place. Especially a nurse called ESTER from the CDU ward who was working on 17/02/22 night shift my grandma passed out went all yellow and cold and she has the audacity to say we’re being “dramatic”!
My grandma was left to suffer and now her health has deteriorated. 90% of staff here have no sympathy no care or respect for patients. Makes you wonder if the nurses behave this way while us being present what happens when individuals are left without family members! KEEP LOVED ONES AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL!",1
I had been trying to see my own GP for two weeks and didn't really want to attend A and E but the pain was too much (forcing me to attend). On arrival I was warned at the entrance to A and E that the waiting time was 3-6 hours and asked if I was willing to wait. I was treated with compassion and seen within an hour! I was VERY happy with being given the antibiotics I needed within 30 minutes after the consultation as the pharmacy was shut. So pleased with the fantastic care I received and the staff (including the admin assistant) were working so hard. Thank you A and E Heartlands,5
"Every staff member that I engaged with was calm, helpful, kind and efficient. Given the high volume of people waiting and it being early hours of the morning, it could have been a nightmare but it was fine. I was very impressed with the service given. The waiting room in A&E had a TV, water fountain and toilets so our needs were met while we waited too. Thank you.",5
"Visited children's A&E this afternoon with my son after he hurt his leg tripping over yesterday. We were given a wheelchair, dealt with quickly, initial exam then x-ray then results then a plaster cast within 2 hours. The staff were all very friendly and kind, very efficient without making us feel like anything was a rush, and explained everything perfectly! Many thanks to all of them",5
Had appointment for covid jab but missed the appointment time as I couldn't park no spaces available after driving around for 25 minutes i had to give up. Unable to cancel or change appointment on NHS app and no appointments available at doctors 😒...not good!,1
"Rude Dr first name Elizabeth. Husband had suspected stroke but still he waited 2 hrs to be seen by triage nurse. Dr came but started asking questions to which my husband was confused so I got up the symptoms that I saw earlier to help me explain but the doctor said turn my phone off as shes the doctor not google, I tried to explain that if it wasn't for Google I wouldn't have known what was happening and its my way of remembering to look it up. She was very rude and I told her so and she walked off and sent my husband back to the waiting room even though they suspect a stroke. Avoid heartlands at all cost. They slso refused to give me there names. Very unprofessional and I know as I work in a hospital.",1
"Visited Heartlands Fracture Clinic today with my daughter. I can honestly say that from the Surgeon we saw, the nurses, the X-Ray department, Dennis the singing porter and the lovely man in the ticket office we had great friendly service from everyone. Thank you for looking after my daughter so well. Credit where credit due.",5
"I had to go to A&E last night. When we finally found where we had to go, the greeter was so kind, the receptionists were helpful and steered us where we had to go. On getting to unit 9 we were greeted by Nurse Liz, straight away. I was treated quickly and efficiently by Liz, who was fantastic. Thank you.
Kate & Hannah",5
"If you want to meet devils come to heartlands hospital, theirs plenty in there with blue uniform.",1
"I received surgery at the day surgery suite on the 30th August 2022. At heartlands. The staff were wonderful both the nursing and medical teams. They showed professionalism, care and compassion and made the whole experience for me, one of ease and support. The words ‘Thank you’ don’t seem enough to express my gratitude
But I am so thankful and grateful for your care and support… THANK YOU!
Jacqui x",5
My dad was in for 2 weeks and all the staff on ward 21 couldn't have done any more they were professional in everything  they done they kept coming and checking on him as often has they could if he had a bowel movement he was cleaned within 5 minutes they treated him with so much dignity nothing was too much of a problem im so impressed with all the staff I can't speak more highly thank  you all for all you have done especially has my daddy as got dementia and partly deaf,5
You will not be seen before 7 hours of wait… there’s literally no point going here. Might as well go to your local gp than them. Approximately 8/10 hours wait,1
I spent Christmas Day receiving exemplary treatment in the emergency department and from cardiology staff.  The reception/ security staff dealt very well with a couple of incidents of shouty aggressive behaviour from patients.  A long day but I feel fortunate to have been looked after so well.,5
"Incredibly rude nurse staff in A&E, no compassion and don't care about the patient waiting. Waiting time is atrocious and wouldn't recommend anyone to go there. Staff need re-training and a overall terrible, horrible place",1
"Can never get through to the hospital
On seeing father in law positive covid strip left on his table.  Not on top of towel .  Spoke tonsister who said have to leave them until ....ok...why on removal was the table not  cleaned?  Why no notices put up?  Is it no longer mandatory to take precautions.  Also, safeguarding father in laws chair broken",1
"Very little staff
No toilet paper any where
Cafe closed. Coffee machine in foyer out of order
Vending machine not working
Both escalators not working  very slow
No good if patient on ward 23/24 if u have problems walking or with breathing
Lifts in main corridor",1
"Good hope hospital is way better.
Staff here don’t care about u.",1
"I would like to compliment the staff of the vascular team at the Heartlands Hospital, especially Ivan, Zina and Kate. They offered my husband a lot of time, answered the questions that were bothering us during the appointments and showed a lot of patience. We wish the whole team a lot of success in professional and private life. Future success to the surgeon and whole team that performed a leg bypass surgery to my husband.",5
hospital is OK not that bad staff are helpfull but there is some manegment error here waiting time are long expected 8 to 9 hour wait it is to much,3
"If I could give 0 stars I would
This is not the first time it happened the service in the hospital is very poor.
If you can avoid it better.
We have been here waiting for 5 hours and we haven’t even seen a doctor yet.
My little sister has a head injury and they don’t deem it as an emergency. Yet people who had broken arms or so have been checked first and gone home. She is in great pain and i don't see how its not being recognised and checked. If you come in with an ambulance you get a fast service and get treated fast, if you dont you could wait up to 10 hrs",1
"Went to Children’s Outpatients yesterday for my appointment I found that there was 8 broken beds with the same date on them this does make you angry as they say that they haven’t got the beds for sick patients but they have really a lot of them are just broken.
I understand that the NHS is overwhelmed at the moment and probably haven’t got the funding to sort the issues out but it’s not good enough",2
"I attended the Children's A and E with the little one. I heard some really good stuff about the children's department here, hence why I came.

Upon I arrival they took my details and thought my be asked to leave as never been here before. But they were really welcoming and the nurse at the front was making conversation with the little one.

Waited for about half an hour and then a nurse came to see if she can pop the little ones dislocated elbow back in but it didn't. To be fair the little one was eye balled with tears and screaming. They tried there best to accomdate, be friendly and patient but due to past experience elsewhere she is not so fond of them.

Waited for another 3-4 hours and completely understood that being their busy period and priortising more urgent matters. To be fair I waited far longer at other places but appreciated they squeze us in.

Bless the nurses they did come around to check up to whcih was surprisingly new which left a impression on me. The little one was getting impatient by the end of waiting time and asked the receptionist if I could get some food or did she think that I could be called out. She looked up on the system and with no issues at all, no sighs or remarks which I have got at other places. She said I am pretty much going to be called out and won't make it back in time and to my surprise a few minutes later the doctor called our name out.

The doctor and nurse that was in the room were super friendly and tried accommodating the little one but she has never been fond of the doctors and said do what you have to. They asked if I am sure and less than a few minutes I heard the pop. They asked to monitor for 15 minutes and she was happy as a bunny.

Awesome team in the Children's department and a big thank you for helping out!!!",5
PLEASE PROVIDE HEATING THE PLACE IS ICE COLD INSIDE,1
"The worst place ever.
I had very bad experience on ward 11, 4 weeks ago, and I need back here for another procedure. I Was hoping for better treatment this time but its still terrible.
After nephrostomy procedure i had high heart rate. They want to check me with midwife because of pregnancy.
Left me for my own on waiting area on the chair
I can't sit because of the pain. They told me I need to have assist with someone for at least 24hours but now left by myself..",1
Visited children's A & E with my 2 year old this afternoon who had a head injury. We were seen very quickly and each and every staff member we dealt with went above and beyond to make us and my daughter feel comfortable. Thank you all.,5
"I would like to say that my experience wasn't bad when attending the hospital today, the doctor that saw me was caring and I was able to get a clear outcome. My only complaint is that some patients attending the hospital were really rude and disrespectful towards the security guy who was just doing his job. I just hope the hospital take tougher action on individuals who come for the wrong reasons.",3
"My baby was transferred here after birth to the NICU. I was devastated because I hadn’t been discharged from the other hospital and spent the first night away from my baby. The staff at NICU were amazing. The paediatric consultant was so lovely. I wanted to breastfeed and she admitted us together in the neonatal unit to make that possible.

The doctors and nurses listened to me and worked with me so I was able to breastfeed and get her off feeding tube and monitors within 48 hours.

As someone who had suffered severe perinatal anxiety, this was the most positive post natal experience I’ve had.

Save our NHS!",5
"STAY AWAY FOR YOUR HEALTH!

The staff in this hospital do not care about patient safety at all anymore. I have many complaints filed now as the way they have treated us is just not on and is dangerously negligent. Having to have arguments/words with staff on the ward and administrations so often it is ridiculous, im doing the bulk of their jobs to care for my relative because they just wont! They keep giving the wrong medication and assuming we are wrong till they check again.

Even the ceiling was leaking on to patient and they left it for 24 hours before fixing while patient was still in bed getting covered in dust and left it for me to clean up when i got here.

IF YOU HAVE THE CHOICE I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU STAY AWAY OR GET A TRANSFER BECAUSE THIS HOSPITAL WILL DRAIN THE LIFE OUT OF YOU TILL THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BUT A CORPSE..",1
"These guys and girls saved my husbands life tonight. They are so very busy but are always polite and caring. It can't be an easy job, too much pressure on the staff, but they manage it in a very caring way. Thank you to all the staff in the Emergency Dept especially Tom the Dr and Rakeel (sorry if I spelt your name wrong)",5
"My father was admitted to Heartlands hospital, this is a nightmare hospital not much basic care for people.. They should treat people like they would want to be treated. Basic needs like water to drink having a wash is shocking. Wouldn't pay some of these nurses in washers. This hospital needs some serious investigating.",1
"This hospital is possible the worst I’ve come across. No idea what they’re doing, constantly telling lies & can’t even arrange scans to the correct hospital. Seem happy to watch people die in bed. Horrendous experience",1
The waiting time is shocking..the staff standing around. I feel they say 4 to 6 hour wait and to prove a point they make you wait around.,1
"Couldn't have wanted for better care. The paramedics were amazing both on the way there and taking me home. There was an initial long delay moving me from Majors to a ward but I had been adequately triaged and was comfortable and warm, then a couple of changes in Wards but the final destination (all in the one day) of Ward 24 Respiratory was wonderful. The doctors were professional, the consultant was empathic and made himself understood. The nurses were exemplary, friendly and very hardworking. The night nurses were amazing, one in particular - Barbara - remembered everyones preferences for drinks and breakfast orders. She even made me a tea at 4am because I was woken by the battery on my drip beeping, she didn't have to but she knew I was needing fluids (dehydrated). The cleaning staff was proficient and the auxiliary staff were friendly and worked hard to make sure our meals and drinks were hot and the water jugs were replenished and cold. Only downside was the lack of air conditioning which made the nurses jobs harder. Treatment was thorough and I'd have no problem coming back here.",5
"The worst hospital and hospitality. Very arrogant staffs and bit of racism (whites first)

This is not a place you go to, to get well you go there if you want to get sick. The first thing you here from the staffs is the waiting hour os about 9 hours,

Very poor never recommend this.",1
"My mom is currently in the Heartlands following a fall.
The  Dr's, Nurses in all roles are
Compassionate, caring and helpful
.",5
"Parking is terrible, just not enough spaces, ticket machines and the kiosk for parking do not take cards, only one machine takes note's. Cafe is good, and good value. The ward we visited, the nurse's were very friendly and nice.",4
"Attended a&e today and was seen by Dr O Neill one of the GP’s
He was very helpful and went above and beyond to ensure I got the appropriate treatment. He ensured he explained everything thoroughly and I didnt feel rushed. I appreciate the help and its nice to see a Dr who genuinely cares and is so compassionate towards patients as unfortunately this isnt so common nowadays! Thank you very much.",5
"I visited 3x in one week and during the week the staff are so limited and waiting times are insane. I was told I would be expected to wait between 4-6hrs but it turned out to be a 11hr day. Im pregnant, so I suspect that had an influence with staff gaining permissions but here were others waiting similar times to myself.
If you’re unsure about the advice you are given, please get a second opinion from any available staff. I was given the wrong advice, not given my options or told risks to pregnancy and I was given the wrong dosage of blood thinners! I was also told I would be called back the next day to collect medication, but they left me 2 days without meds. Having said this, the staff that are there are lovely. They’re tired, over run and only human themselves!
Saturdays experience was miles better. Less patients in, looks like it was all appointment based so waiting times was still long but no where near as bad as during the week.
One thing I will say is their free hot drinks and food stand was the only thing saving patients from going insane waiting to be seen! Bring a charger and some snacks if you are able to before visiting A&E!

Doctor changed my details back to my old name and address from 5yrs ago without asking my confirmation, and because of this my midwife couldnt access my notes. Was told the doctor made no notes on the system making it difficult for nurses to understand my case. Cannot remember the doctors name, but he was on duty on Ward 19 during nights shift (the only doctor they had I believe!)… again, always get a second opinion if something doesnt feel right. My second and third visits could have been prevented if they just communicated to Womens or my GP.",4
"Our appointment was on time, this part of hospital was almost empty (on Sunday), staff was very friendly and helpful, toilets and halls were clean and also it was a place for kids to play too.",5
"Parking is a nightmare, we arrived at 10:15 and could not find a space, in the end we parked at the side of kerb, at a cost of £5.10 for two hours",3
"Terrible experience. Fell down the stairs and fractured my back and smashed my face. Ambulance took me to this hospital. Staff don’t care and I was discharged without any pain killers. Had to arrange to get home and get to the doctors for some pain relief. A month later and am still in severe pain and non mobile. I don’t like to slate the NHS but this is the worst experience I have had at a hospital. They just didn’t care! Staff sitting around talking about holidays, wouldn’t even get me a drink as they said there isn’t enough working!",1
"The nurses and a&e for the most part were amazing. The doctors and surgeons however had no listening skills, during the draining process on my breast, the doctor turned his back to answer a phone call whilst the needle was still inserted. I was then examined by a new one who claimed ""it looked and felt better"" without actually seeing me before and then decided to discharge me even though the abscess/mastitis was still very much there (and is still there!). When I tried to explain this she interrupted me constantly and came up with several untrue reasons for discharge, it wasn't until I spoke to a lovely nurse afterwards when I learned that there was nothing they could do as a hospital as they don't have treatment or anyone qualified available, so I wasted 5 days there for no reason.  And I've come home with an IV burn on my arm even though I made them aware several times that the area was burning and painful, they just put off changing the placement of the tube. Whats more, I was breastfeeding my child and have had to switch to formula as I couldn't send milk home as it was contaminated with codeine and morphine. I wasn't the only one in my bay to be ignored regarding my needs from the doctors and I hope this can be improved, because I am still in pain and i am now calling other hospitals and surgeries to try and find a solution. I understand the strain on the NHS and I understand the shortage of staff, but sometimes listening can go a long way. Thankyou for the nurses who took the time to do this, especially the night staff as they had so much patience and kindness.",2
"12/03/23 - On arrival at GoodHope, due to being in soo much pain, I was also throwing up blood and had a low body temp! I was unable to sit up, I tried to speak to staff as-well as inform them of my mental health issues, as well as feeling like I was going have a panic attack. The male nurse who was allocating next to reception treated me like dirt. Due to the pain when sitting down I had to lie on the floor I was told to get up by the male nurse or he will make-sure I wait longer, I’m not sure this is what the NMC teaches? I will be taking this further, I did not argue back, stated to him I just needed to be left alone. This lead me to discharging myself and being more unwell, once I’m back up on my feet an official complaint will be launched.",1
"This has to be the worst hospital in the U.K.
The wait times are outrageous.
I dropped my mum off on the 23/4/22 11PM, it’s currently 6AM Sunday morning and she’s only been seen by a nurse. Her blood pressure is abnormally high and she has pain in her chest. People have literally given up waiting and walked out. Some people have been there since 9PM and are still waiting to be seen by a doctor. Don’t take your loved ones to this hospital. I will update this review to log when my mum is actually seen by a doctor although I don’t think it will be anytime soon.

- So at 07:40AM after waiting 8Hrs and 40 minutes, my sister who was with my mum at the hospital has been told rather abruptly by one extremely rude individual that she has to leave because it’s against covid rules even though it was fine for her to be with my mum initially. My sister tried to explain my mums health situation and the rude woman told her “well if she’s had an ECG she’s fine.” I’m not a doctor, but neither is that excuse of a human, and anyone with any amount of medical knowledge knows that blood work is standard practise irrespective of ECG. Besides, my mum doesn’t speak English, has a hard time communicating and is dependent on us. She was terrified to stay without my sister and is now at home in a worse state.  F****** disgusting place with horrible insensitive bas***** as staff. They just make it up as they go along.

Once again, please don’t take anyone you love and care about to this shambles of a hospital. They deserve more than the humiliation and negligence they are likely to receive here.",1
Very clean and has hand sanitiser and face masks at all entrance which you need to use before entering the hospital,5
Right from the beginning my husband has had first class treatment. From nurses to Consultants. His P.D.Nurses have been there for him from day one. They are excellent. So is his Consultant.We could not fault them in any respect. Thankyou.!!!,5
"On our arrival there was more than enough parking spaces without having to circle the car park.  Security were helpful when asked for directions.  The waiting time was not as long as expected.  A bonus was that the hot chips in the canteen were hot, and not soggy.",5
My brother died on ward 8 alone absolutely disgusting hospital.,1
"This is a very large hospital with lots of different specialised departments. It has a massive car park which is free for 30mins, £3.10 for 2 hours and £5.10 for 4 hours. It has a number of general shops as well as for  having a bite to eat. The visiting hours are from 11am to 7pm with 2 visitors allowed at any one time.",4
Staff were great ..caring and professional..from start to finish..only one issue ...one young porter had to be asked to show a little respect for his passenger who was over 90 years of age and has dementia...this individual thort it acceptable to hit every wall and door post in the hospital...when asked to have some care he didn't even acknowledge or reply..a real shame one individual let's a great side down ..,5
Parking is absolutely disgusting. And my family member is in there and think the care is not the best,1
"horrible place, avoid. 9 hour wait in a and e, specifically mentioned that 111 advised it may be a stroke and need to be seen within an hour. Nurse withheld information that only 1 doctor was working and rudely shouted at other patients",1
"Had to attend A &E this morning in a lot of pain and was sent to SAU department. Couldn't have been looked after any better despite them being understaffed. All the staff were caring , efficient and professional.
Thank you .",5
7 years old children not feeling well waiting for 6h and they saying still no dr available yet waiting few more hours what they get paid for is this in Uk 🙈,1
"I've only given one star as I've had to in order to give a review, got my Dad in for narcolepsy testing, patient transport collected him at 4.30pm after nothing but aggro about not being eligible regardless to using transport prior, having had 3 strokes, partially deaf and severely sight impared, transport driver was swearing and vaping in the ambulance on the way up there, finally starting with the procedures, he had help carrying his bags and machines they requested he'd take up to the ward, he was only allowed sandwiches for food as they couldn't guarantee food would arrive before more tests started, offered him 1 blanket and that was it, so he was cold and hungry!! An hour before transport arrives to bring him home the following day  they decide his not eligible for transport again as he walked without an aid as apparently white canes don't count as aids at the heartlands hospital or for the transport department, they then refused to help him carry all his belongings and machines back down despite being escorted to the main exit by one of the nurses off the unit called Sam warbanks  from ward 24/25, when my dad asked for help to get transport home Sam told him it's not his problem and left him in the main foyer with no help whatsoever, I get they are a busy hospital but the care for the blind and or disabled is shocking. Unless urgent care is required I would strongly suggest steering clear of this one unless you want to be disrespected and abandoned. CQC will definitely be hearing about the lack of care and compassion this hospital offers. Despite the fact his own GP tried her very best to get it all sorted for him them to stop answering calls from the GPsurgery aswell.",1
My mom wasn't told which hospital to come to for her last minute chest x-ray so we came to Hearlands as usual. Turned out it was Solihull hospital. The staff were loveley and friendly and couldn't do enough to get my mom an xray sorted here. A big thank you to Beth on the x-ray desk at heartlands hospital. She is a star.,5
My 16 year old daughter got bit on the face by a dog. We arrived at heartlands A&E department and they took her straight to a doctor. My daughter was hysterical i stayed at the reception to check her in and by the time i got to  her the doctor had calmed her down that was within minutes. The nurses was great giving her the medication she needed. A referral was made to The QE hospital for urgent treatment and hospital transport was offered.  Unfortunately I can't remember the doctors name or any of the other medical staff that provided her with treatment. We can't thank them enough,5
Im trying to locate your xray ultrasound department for an appointment  can't find it.,1
Long night in the hospital. Staff are great.wait times are long having a little bit of a nap. All in all a pleasant visit.,4
"Absolutely terrible. I dislocated my patella (kneecap) and 6 hours for an ambulance the wait was!!! In the end, my mother got sick of waiting and took me in the back of her car. She wanted to park directly outside of the hospital, rather then the car park (as I'm heavy obviously) had to pay 60 pounds to park there!",1
They are understaffed and obstructions in the hallway. Which led to a midwife being harmed by a door slamming in her face. Not good hazard control. The staff very unprofessional on triage / delivery suite. Overall too many patients too little staff. Don’t accept patients if you are overfilled!,1
Absurd A&E wait times. Over 12 hours and still waiting to be seen. No communication between departments. Management should be ashamed. If this experience is indicative of where the NHS is headed then we should all be very worried.,1
"horrible hospital. rude nurses. i came to a&e in agonising pain i could barely walk because of a (possible) kidney infection. they took my urine sample and gave me cocodamol, 6 hours later i saw a doctor who completely ignored why i was at the hospital and tried to give me uti medication and sent me on my way. the next day i went to pick up my medication (that he said would be ready at 9am) but when i asked, there was no prescription nor evidence i was even at a&e. i had to see a separate doctor and waiting an hour to see him. he took my urine sample and instantly told me i definitely had a kidney infection and gave me medication.",1
"3rd time at the Hartlands children hospital A&E
- this area of Hartlands is a joke!!
No facility for children with hidden disability that are hypersensitive to crowded places and the nurses are q joke.  When my child started beeing frustrated and started screaming, instead of giving us a room and priority ( we have a card) we have been looked angry at and told to make him quiet!

Second time visit with my older child , having otitis ( a very bad ear infection ) that was spread to his throat , having high temperatures and screaming in pain , instead of offering treatment we have been offered liflets .. we have waited 6h in hospital for liflets.. we had to fone 111 again and beeing referred to a out of hours GP ( badgers) to them beeing shoked that hospital didn't offered treatment.  Fortunately we have received pain relief qnd antibiotics from the badgers service

Thir time visit with my older screaming in pain and itchiness on his bum... no treatment again left waiting 4h to be told by nurses that the hospital is not holding no treatment.  What was my point in waiting 4h. Had to contact again after hours and refereed to badgers or pharmacy for a quick treatment.

Some of the nurses are a joke .. I asked her if she has any form of painkiller or a cream  that I can give to stop or soothe a bit the pain and itchiness.. and with a very horrible sarcasm told that I should of gone pharmacy( 1am in the morning ) as they do not have no treatment for it .. but in a very rude way.. like I'm shoked, are very rude are very sarcastic .. never again to that hospital as honestly is a joke ..

As for the adult part I have no bad reviews they have been always nice and caring .",1
Was seen fast in and out within an hour,5
I have an appointment at 13h45 time and they couldn’t explain me where to go I had to find my way to the mri place,1
"Some of the nurses were abrupt when speaking to them. It was ok. They took care of my mom, especially when she went back in just after being discharged due to her condition: they were quick to arrange her operation so she could have the best chance at not getting worse.

You can't visit still which was the only hard thing on my mom but one of the nurse let her see me from a distance when driving sunny off so that was nice. I know it really helped my mom whilst she was there.",4
Just been to Heartlands Hospital  A&E and i have to say staff was so friendly and  helpful. I was in treated  and out in 1hour 10min  record  . We are travelling  on holidays and called there after i fell and hurt my hand. So glad we picked this hosiptal,5
"Visited to have my daughter via c section on 11/1/19 and stayed for 2 nights. Excellent care from the start to finish. The doctors, nurses,  surgeons, anaesthetists, midwives and support staff were friendly and very welcoming - nothing was too much. I stayed on Aspen ward and each staff member throughout the day and night shifts were just superb. They made you feel so relaxed and that you were important. This is the best care I have ever received and would like to commend all of the staff who were a part of mine and my daughters care. Thank you so much for all of your hard work!",5
Absolutely dreadful hospital came with my son at midnight waited over 6 hours to actually see a doctor while my son has fever over 39’ absolutely appalled to top it off we were brought here by ambulance having 1 doctor as well hospital Needs to be closed! Pathetic waste of time,1
"If you have a death wish and don't want to live another Day feel free to visit this place. Massively understaffed, very very few qualified staff, seem to be de-professionalising every area of care and profession.  E.g you won't see a Dr, instead you will be seen by a poorly skilled work shy nurse that likes to play at being a Dr. Another example is the use of poorly educated pharmacy technicians (these ppl have no university qualifications, most lack GCSEs, often cheat their way through a Micky mouse level 3 distance learning qualifications) who like to play at being a pharmacist. This hospital does not care about patients, all they care about is saving money. Now they are opening a whole new unit which will be nurse run, clearly are intent cutting labour costs at the expense of safety and costs. The only people in this hospital that will actually show you any compassion is the HCAs, porters, the lowest paid in the hospital. They call this place heatless not heartlands hospital.",1
"I had an hysterectomy here, I was in terrible pain. My doctor referred me to this hospital, for 16 hours in hospital, I went there and when I asked when my appointment was gonna happen, they said they didn't know, and the doctor's conduct was not very well, and there. They sent me to the covid ward, and left me there, to ask why I was there, 2 doctors did not answer me correctly on why I was sent there. I have 2 little children at home, and all they could care about was their godforsaken covid ward, then I was told I was stuck their for 4-5 days. And then I was questioned on what would my children would do in the event of my death, they are SO, SO, SO arrogant, they  did not give me a CT scan. Worst hospital ever.

Now, i'm going to do private CT scan. I'm not rich, i'm middle class. But the fact they didn't listen to me angers me more.",1
"After visiting Heartlands early Sunday morning with my 82 year old father I wanted to say a huge thank you to all of the staff who were on duty in Majors. They showed dad such kindness. We were both treated with great compassion, offered hot drinks and food. Doctors explained everything clearly so that dad, who suffers from Dementia felt included. During our time in the department staff were being verbally abused but they never showed anything but professionalism. An admission to the Opal Unit meant dad received the care he needed. Thank you from a grateful daughter.",5
"My father was admitted to the heartlands birmingham 29/02/22 and eventually ended up on ward 8. He was extremely ill and it was quite obvious to the family he was not going to survive. So all of our attempts to visit my dad before he died was thrown back at us “because of covid” even tho restrictions had been eased! so eventually we made a complaint to PALS and we was told one person from the family can visit. My sister arrived to be told you can only visit if you feed your dad. I can’t believe the staff can actually get away with saying this. So the following day I contacted PALS again they were no help whatsoever. Then conveniently ward 8 blocked all visting once again due to “covid” I had to constantly chase a dr for a phone call/update on my dad only once did a
Dr actually make contact with me without me having to beg for a callback within a 4 week period! I was told by the dr that your dad is extremely ill you should be able to vist but unfortunately the ward manager says no visting until it’s end of life. The family had a call on 28/03/22 at 9:30 at night to say unfortunately your father will not survive night even tho I had been ringing ward 8 all day to be told “he’s fine he’s doing well” I had 20 minutes with him before he died shortly after midnight. It’s absolutely disgusting that my dad spent the last month of his life on his own. The nurses and ward manger where such hard work no care towards the family it makes me wonder what kind of care did he actually receive during his stay. My words can’t explain how angry and upset we are. They should be ashamed of themselves. I have since tried leaving a review on the nhs website for the heartlands birmingham but it has been taken down in fact it’s the same review I’m leaving now.",1
"This is not a hospital this is where you come if you want to end your life sooner as suggested by one nurse who has worked here for 20 years.. The staff are like kites dancing in a hurricane. I could compare this building to mcd*nalds. This is a training ground for newly qualified doctors and nurses who don’t have a clue what they are doing.very little experience, expertise and no care for wellbeing of patient.  Medication is never given on time. Very dirty place and dirty practises. Student and junior level nurses leaving gauzes and wipes on patients bed. Not returning in time to remove IV drip. If you ask a question they come up with ten different excuses. I am in Ward 16 with my son. People queuing outside trying to get in, pressing the buzzer, they couldn’t care less. When on ward it is calm no nurses in sight most in the play room having a hot drink. Parents not allowed hot drinks. I could go on forever, this is by far the worst hospital in England. If referred here beg and plead to be sent somewhere else if you want to maintain your sanity. Unfortunately I’m stuck here for the next few weeks.",1
"My son had his first Seizure and they came really quick. The staff here was lovely and patient. Thank you NHS for your amazing service towards my son, myself and the family and reassured us.  Very knowledgeable. His now lively, playful 💙 thank you again ❤",5
"Basically l am in pain had a nast fall over my face, because l fainted this nurse, mock because l was in a sauna, she was worried about what bring in my clothes from my bag, assessment all my brand of my clothes, georgina, but she didn't accept, l am in so much pain, this its no the first time l come to this hospital, got a cut finger badly and had 5 stitches, the nurses here are horrid human been. I am in pain and crying, she doesn't know who to do assessment, she lost the discharge of the patient. This place its with horrid horrible nurses.",1
Didn't wait long to be seen in and out 1and 1/2 hour well looked after,4
"I wouldn’t even give the one star

My husband was waiting standing around in queue  for an hour at the A&E department

He done X-ray had a broken ankle only to be sent home and a cast appointment to be given four days away his ankle swelled up rang few professionals  places only to be told they should have dealt with the ankle there and then as it could have been further damaged without a plaster on  so yes please avoid if possible the staff are rude also no professional background whatsoever and I wasn’t the only one that felt this few more people who were waiting for loved ones felt this !

This is a major disappointment as the maternity ward is absolutely amazing !",1
Would give it 0 stars if I could my sister been in hospital for 2 days staff so rude and ignorant and they haven’t gave a table for the side and one nurse complained Abt the stuff on the floor when they haven’t gave my sister a table. This needs to be addressed and the nurses here should be ashamed of how they speak to patients and treat them,1
In and out in 30 minutes after cutting my hand deeply. I was a little worried at how long the wait would be but super efficient and well organised. My nurse was lovely and chatty while she glued me back together which made me feel at ease and the staff that I saw when waiting asked if I was doing okay and help me to elevate my hand. Thanks all!,5
"Terrible hospital never to go back even if I was left to die at home.. disgusting care, rude nurses and no doctors to be seen.. this hospital runs off nurses and students.. why do we give tax answer Me some one.. Read all the posts about this hospital.. needs to be closed down or manage by some who knows what they are doing",1
Ward 10 my mother has been in there 2 weeks with problems she was given the bed sheets to her bed n told that she would have to do it herself as the person was due a break my mum is over 70 years old and has copd aswell as walking problems this is absolutely disgusting and disappointing to her about the last time she was in also she had a falling out with a nurse and they let her leave with a canula still in her hand should be ashamed of yourselves hearlands staff,1
"Been here twice on separate occasions.
First time my partner thought she had fractured her skull - 12 hours we were here.
Second time today with my daughter who is 3 weeks old - 12 hours again.
Also I'm.not allowed to be with my partner i have to sit in car outside.
Takes ages for someone to answer the THREE BUZZERS you have to press to get in. One time no one answered at all. Disgusting hospital appalling",1
"Anyone wishing their loved one to die should definitely send them here. My Dad was admitted and on the same day he was going to be sent home.  it, didn't work very effectively. Today weve been told he has heart failure and sent home. Apparently some nurses will be out to see him and he will have more tests.  Absolutely disgusting, the only person I would send to this god forsaken hospital is Putin.  I know the NHS are struggling but there Can be no excuse for negligence!! These people may not be important to you but they are our family,, the people we love. Would these doctors like their loved ones treated this way? SHAMEFUL!!!!",1
"I've been trying to book a blood test for my child over a month now. However, the line is always busy it's literally never rang. I went through the switchboard and an hour on the line it kept coming back to the switchboard who also got fed up. How can a blood test booking line be constantly busy with them not putting it down for a ring to even get through in a whole hour. Disgraceful! I think the phone is off the line on purpose anyone who calls will probably get line busy. They don't want to do their jobs. Can anyone suggest who i can contact for this.",1
Absolutely horrible! The queue was huge and after sending me from one department to another I Ve been told that I need to wait for a Gp appointment for the next day . Even if my problem was for a gynecology department. I went home and searched for a private appointment which is really hard to find. Very disappointed as we pay loads in taxes and I don't know why we pay if we need medical urgent care and we don't get it . You actually have to be near death so they could care about you and actually do some blood test or anything else .,1
"I was admitted recently to Heartlands as emergency. From the ambulance crew, A&E staff, xray department to ward 11, everyone was absolutely amazing, caring and provided prompt treatment.

Unfortunately even the times of pandemic some patients make life hard for staff, by being rude and not adhering to rules. Despite that the staff still state they had a duty of care to those patients. The staff have patience of a Saint. A big thank you to everyone at Heartlands.",5
"Partner was taken here by ambulance due to an extreme allergic reaction that I was told could cost him his life. Completely distraught all I could do was wait for a phone call to be told how he is. They sent him home completely delirious without any medication or advice!
Son had to go to A&E as a result of a bad injury. Was told by the A&E doc in childrens dept to come back within 5 weeks if it doesn't look to be healing and he will need to be seen by ent. Went back 4 weeks later and ent said they can't do anything and to wait another 8 years until he turns 16 before they can decide to treat the injury to his nose! She then tells me he's still in pain because I haven't given him paracetamol continuously for a month and I haven't given him a medication he's not allowed to have due to health issues. She then proceeds to tell me I should just give him a bit and see how he goes! What on earth is wrong with them! Had I have done that they'd tell me I'm trying to harm my child by giving him something he's not allowed. Yet for them to suggest it it's fine because they're the health professionals. What a load of nonsense! These incompetent Doctors need to realise the nonsense that comes out of their mouths and realise that they could be held liable! Both times there was a very racist nurse there who spoke to some parents very rudely for not wearing a mask properly and to others of the same skin colour as her, she said nothing for the exact same thing! Could the revolting discrimination be more blatant! Sickening behaviour!",1
"Every time I phone ward 24 I get cut off , phoning to see how my father in law is.. Today I've been trying for 1 houd and 45 minutes... not just today its happened, its every time my father in law ends up being a patient there... absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating...",1
"I am positively sure All good 4/5 stars reviews are not genuine. I have visited emergency at 1:00pm and I’m still there after 2:30 am morning around 13 hours and did not do anything could help me, very lazy nurses and doctors, A/E full of people waiting long time like I did, for this one star is way too much for them… honestly I’m very very disappointed",1
"Staff are rude obnoxious and arrogant.
Not understanding the anxiety and emotions that are also a key aspect to hospital care.
Not explaining what they are going to do alongside neglect and proper due care.",1
"They dont even deserve one star. I had an asthma attack the staff told me to wear a mask even with my disbility to breath correctly. What kind of staff is that, they even told me : dont exagerate .  Like how in a world you treat someone that are suffering of asthma attack like that. The rudeness was at  high level. Even after six hours I didnt see the doctor, I had to check online how to calm down my asthma attack. Absolutely disgusting, dont go there its waisting time. Choose a better hospital.",1
They dont even deserve 1 star. I really hope this comment make change. My 8 years old son got very bad pain in his belly and its been 3 nights he got temperature and pain and more then 20 times doctors checked him they still dont know what is weong what kind of doctors are they. I cant see my son having pain and they dont do anything just keep giving him paracetamol thats all . Iam very disappointed . You see most doctors nurses they just  chatting and wasting the time thats all they can do. I dont knw y they dont tell them to do their job properly.,1
"Ward 18. A huge thank you to the nurses and doctors who showed kindness to our mum following surgery for a broken hip. You saved her life and we are so grateful that our dear mum and granny is still alive.
Unfortunately many of the nurses were extremely cruel and left her wanting to die because she felt so degraded and worthless. Told her not to be a baby. Didnt respond to her buzzer to take her to the toilet for nearly an hour, so she soiled herself, then proceeded to scold her. Handled her roughly.  Told her to do as she was told. Gave us misinformation about her recovery. This included being told by 2 different nurses that our mum was confused and had not been out of bed when she called to tell us she had taken her first steps. She actually had!  I will never forget your cruelty.",1
"I was admitted to hospital on Sunday evening and ended up with having to stay in Ward 5.

Before and after having my Op the staff it that ward were fantastic.
My recovery period was shortened by the caring, understanding and needs I received to recover faster from all the staff.

Thanks,
Keep up the great things you are doing.
❤️😘🤗",5
"Avoid this run down hospital… very rude staff, poor service… looks like a hospital in a third world country…. A very unsafe place to be",1
This 5* is for Christine who is working the day shift today on major b very kind and helpful and gives the best patient care can not thank you enough for all the hard work you put in today for our grandad x                      another shout out to razheem in mayor c on looking after my mom today 19.2.23 you was an absolute Saint and made it so much more bearable for her and keeping her well hydrated with the tea thank you to the paramedics and all the staff that made sure she was okay and well looked after x,5
"I have never met  such rude receptionists as I did in a&e , and the first person rude who took blood pressure etc.
Luckily then we saw a lovely nurse and doctors.",2
They dont even deserve 1 star. The service they provide is disgusting I really hope this comment makes a change. I am very disappointed . You see most doctors nurses they just chatting and wasting the time thats all they can do. They need to be told to do their job properly.,1
"These lot don’t even deserve 1 star. My gran was taken in by the ambulance on Monday, and the paramedics were so rude, thinking they knew better than everyone. She was experiencing obvious symptoms of a stroke, and they dismissed it straight away. 2 days later they’ve called us saying she’s had 2 strokes and has covid19. How incapable can an establishment be? Their communication is absolutely ridiculous, barely any updates from doctors or nurses, you can’t get through to them over the phone. This is neglect and we will be taking this further. They left my gran sat there for 7 hours whilst she was having a stroke & did absolutely nothing. Don’t think I will leave this alone you tramps.",1
A busy place for some reason.  It wasn't this bad a decade or two ago.  Why is that?  Nice parking/customer service staff in the new main entrance.,3
"I was referred urgently to ward 23 by the GP. The staff there were remarkably jovial and pleasant despite being so busy!

There were delays in sorting medicines to take out and a few other niggles, but overall a good experience.",5
"The security guard hovering around the outpatients department this afternoon (about 430pm) has a serious attitude problem, clearly a racial profiler! Fair enough he allowed me in and asked me to sanitize my hands which I did, however I was sent back to the main entrance and then back to outpatients as staff were unsure where my appointment  was. Only this time he had short term memory loss and would not allow me in almost making me late for my appointment, even though I explained he'd just let me in. Taking umbrage that I was not putting up with his nonsense (I am sick) he decided to jump on his radio, follow me and stare at me as if to intimidate me. You're hospital security not a door man in a seedy nightclub. Have some manners and respect for vulnerable patients! Not a good reflection on the NHS, however the nursing staff were professional. Never get rude security at QE.",1
Rude staff completely unorganised made no attempt to help or advise waited 5 and a half hours for a Dr to tell me to go to the gp and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. Even though I was sent to a and e by NHS 111 with a jaw that constantly dislocates. Avoid if you can waste of tax payers money that place.,1
Can't even get through to them they just keep hanging up after waiting on phone for ages disgusting,5
"I want to write an opinion about the services of the hospital...🤔 on 16.02.2020 at 7:00 pm My husband was urgently brought to the patients waiting room, and what I mean is that at first we had good impressions about the team that was at the service at the time... but after we stayed from 7:00 pm until 3:00 am in the waiting room we changed our mind about them and decided that they are not working professionally there and it is an indifferent attitude towards patients🙈🙉🥺🤕 only at 3:00 am we was taken and they took my husband to the hospital for sick patients..... and my husband had physical weaknesses because he didn't eat anything,it was really awful🙉😢🥺 so we are disappointed with the professionalism of the doctors... we hope we won't get there anymore!! We want to thank the girls who transported us from home to the emergency were kind and nice🤝🙏👍👏✌️🕊",1
"Other that the waiting hours and a few members of the staff(not nurses) from the ENT department, who were gossiping about the patients or laughing about what they did or said, I have no complaint whatsoever. I went in almost having sepsis and I was treated straight away, felt better within 2 days and was discharged on the 3rd day with appropriate treatment. There are some nurses there that deserve all respect for their hard work.",4
"My dad was here for almost six months before he passed away. It was a real roller-coaster of emotions all the way through from inspirational to horrific.

Nothing but praise for the ambulance crew who took my dad to hospital, the calm way they took charge of the situation and waited with us until my dad could be booked in.

A&E itself was appalling, from arriving mid afternoon my dad had to wait on a trolley in a corridor for hours before being moved to a cubicle. It wasn't until 1 am that he was finally given a hospital bed.

One of the main areas where Heartlands falls down is communication.
Nursing staff were usually too busy to tell me about my dad's condition what treatments he was receiving. Arrangements for a possible discharge were unclear with mixed messages from occupational therapists, social workers and hospital staff. Also communication between regular and locum/relief nursing staff didn't seem good, as the relief staff seemed less knowledgeable about my dad's condition.

Sepsis training is urgently needed, my dad went from being alert and able to feed himself to slurred speech, being fed with a spoon and sickness in a matter of a week. Initially nursing staff claimed this was due to a decline in mental capacity and at least a  week went by before sepsis was properly diagnosed. My dad was extremely frail anyway and it probably wouldnt have made a difference, but being able to spot sepsis quicker may help others in the future.",2
Hello i spent the day in the day surgery unit and cant stress enough what a fantastic group of hard working careing staff they are from the trainee nurses lovely carers up to surgeons and theatre staff .absolutely excellent experience from start to finish great work be proud x,5
My brother died on ward 8 during the covid pandemic he died alone as i wasnt allowed to visit the care was abymal a dog would be treated better would rather die in my own comfy bed at home than on one of their dirty filty beds disgusting place,1
"ENT Heartlands Birmingham.
Not impressed with the Asian lady Doctor on ENT dept ""sorry don't know her name"" found her completely abrupt, wasn't interested in listening to what a patient had to say, went to micro clean my ear but then didn't bother and all she could do was complain about the noise the machine was making. I'm suffering with loud tinnitus and got NO advice on how to deal with it and was told it would just go away over time, ""poor advice""  No explanation or help with it at all, not interested and was clearly trying to rush me for the next patient. Reception staff were great and helpful and friendly as were the other nurses.
Just ashame to be left down by that particular Doctor, who should be setting a better example. Still suffering with my ears after 6 months and still not sorted! But yet she discharged me and said go to my GP if I have any more problems. Rude and abnoxious. She has let you all down unfortunately.",2
"Realy is the worst In birmingham over all they are careless to look after the patient  just getting first initial assesment takes 8 hrs seeing the Gp 13hrs from ur arriving I had accodent i was feeling pain every one is ignoring u words.
This was my second time i remember my wife was in labouring section they did to her quick c section with in 24 just to conclude the situation careless the impact my wife will struggle",1
The A&E To be renamed A carnt call it emergency room with 8 hour delays,1
"Went to new treatment centre today very impressed,but the main problem with heartlands is still parking,it’s virtually impossible to get in car park it’s always full and if you enter it you just end up queuing to get out without finding a place and that can take 30 mins , when you have an appointment the biggest stress is not the appointment it’s not being able to park anywhere",3
"I've had a minor operation here in Heartland's. Despite what other reviews are saying, I left the hospital feeling better and with a big smile on my face. Staff from maintenance to the surgeons and nurses were all very accommodating. I was very well taken cared of. I was alone during my operation but I felt secure and worry free because of the caring staff. Thank you for looking after me!",5
If you have type 1 diabetes and are unable to do your own insulin you are better off staying at home than coming here!! If your blood sugars are high they will not let you eat anything and will not give insulin. After meals they will not let you have more than 6 units of insulin because they are too lazy to carb count. Even with diabetic nurses and the patient arguing with them to up the insulin they still won't listen because it means more work for them and they just can't be bothered. Ward 2 and ward 18 are like this to but there could possibly be more the same so beware if you or a loved one is in there with diabetes.,1
"Appreciate the hard work and effort of the staff however communication is non existent especially in A&E. I'll find out and get back to you means i will forget about you till you chase me non stop and i manage to agitate you beyond your patience. 15 hour wait times, worse than 3rd world countries. Ridiculous!!",1
Ecocity group is helpful of all us . All are very helpful . Here work profession tam work all-time. Spotless and sanitized business environment,5
"Oh dear! My daughter has just spent six days in Heartlands hospital. Where do I start? She assured me that the nurses on the ENT ward were kind and helpful to her but did mention that there were several colourful arguments amongst the staff while she was there.

To start with she had to spend her first night in a&e which she didn’t complain about but did have cause to question the system when she was eventually discharged at 9.30 six days later then spent the next 10 hours in her room waiting for her meds (which she had to come home without and still hasn’t received!), taking up a bed which could have been allocated to another patient waiting in a&e.

Then the family had an issue with visiting restrictions. We were aware of Covid risk and measures supposedly put in place by Heartlands. I dutifully brought stuff in that my daughter needed and left it at the “drop off” desk in main reception then advised family of this procedure. To my horror I found out that her boyfriend had been allowed to go up to the ward and that my daughter was allowed out of the ward to speak to him. On checking with the staff on main reception they confirmed that this is not allowed under the current restrictions. Whilst I understand my daughters need to see and speak to a loved one, surely visitors should not be allowed to wander the hospital randomly, especially when they have not been monitored for a high temperature.

Next the doctors. When my daughter was transferred from Good Hope a&e it was with a diagnosis of a cyst on the dangly bit at the back of her throat which needed draining as a matter of urgency. After three days at Heartlands they finally decided it was not a cyst but ulcerated and duly put her on steroids and painkillers. My daughter has a benign tumour on her brain stem which makes swallowing tablets difficult normally. With an extremely painful throat she found it impossible but the nurses had to consult with the doctor before giving her alternative pain relief. This took a further day!

When she first went on the ward she told the nurses she has sleep apnea and had asked me to bring her machine in. She was told that she couldn’t have the machine on the ward but couldn’t have a room. At that stage doctors were concerned about her low oxygen levels but when she pointed out that she had already missed two nights on her machine which might be the cause of the low oxygen levels the doctors finally agreed to move her to a room! In the room her mask was replaced by another extremely uncomfortable bit of kit for some reason and she was wired up for permanent oxygen.

Next my other daughter took some clean stuff in for her dropping it off at main reception as per Covid procedures. On her way out she stopped to talk to someone she knew then noticed there were RATS running around the bins close to the main reception doors. She then noticed several tails sticking out of the bins!!!!

Whether or not the bins had been left open or they were just bins for public use without a lid I don’t know. But surely this is a serious health and safety issue?

All in all this was not an impressive visit to Heartlands and I hope with all my heart that I never need to be treated there!!!!",1
"there is no doctor here but only animals, I apologize to all the animals for the offense 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",1
"Not a good visit today.
A& e were excellent, ward 23 is dreadful.
7 hours & were still waiting for someone to check an xray.
No food or drinks offered, when asked you get told off & given a warm sandwich.
Told to wait for an xray to then be told an hour later that we should of walked down there. (Patient suffering chest pains& told to go alone!!).
Gave him a prescription for penicillin, when he's allergic to it. Even had a band on stating he was allergic & not to give it.
Nurse thought it was funny - yes hilarious that he could of ended back in seriously ill. Doctor wasn't impressed with her either!",1
"Given the current climate where relatives cannot visit their loved ones in hospital, you need someone to be in contact with the relatives; keeping them up to date with treatment, results of scans and even the movement to different wards. This concept is completely lost on this hospital. If you manage to get through to the ward your call is picked up and then cancelled. The hospital/wards/doctors/nurses moan about the number of times you call but if no one is keeping relatives upto date what do they expect. I appreciate they have a difficult job but its extremely stressful not knowing how an extremely ill relative is.
I would like to say that this is not an isolated incident and we have experienced this on at least 5 separate occasions when a relative has been taken to this hospital.",1
Attended a&e with chest pains at 2pm to be discharged at 12am with no follow up or out patients appointment. Sat in the a&e waiting room for 9hrs to then be told to go up to an observation ward and told that all my results came back normal. Waste of time I wouldn't recommend this hospital to my worst enemy never mind someone who was actually seriously ill.,1
my wife admitted with cancer and a bleed on the brain day staff superb especially kirstie on ward 24 but sadly the nightstaff on wards 22 and 24 a disgrace due to flippant attitude and looking (loudly) on dating sites and having to call me to ask what meds she's on. after 3 days they should know this. caused her anger and upset with no excuse at all. shame on them. Update - my wife was admitted again and stayed on ward 24 for 3 weeks witb me allowed to stay at her side. The staff were perfect in every way. Arranged our wedding and even made us an album. They worked tirelessly to make her comfortable and then arranged her move to a hospice where she passed peacefully with us at her side. I cannot praise ward 24 enough. God bless all,3
"A huge thank you to staff at Heartlands Hospital over the last week. In particular, to the doctor who I saw in A & E to all of the endoscopy staff department. Endoscopy department staff were kind, gentle and really put me at ease despite me feeling very anxious. Thank you!",5
"Hard to express how lovely many of the staff were.

Sadly others were cruel and lazy.  I don't think they meant to be: they didn't really appear to think.

My Mother was stuck in the hospital after a fracture.  She has dementia.  Some staff would shout at her to get back into bed.  The bay had elderly ladies on it.  They often played radio 1 !

The nurses didn't seem to nurse; they seemed largely consumed in looking at computers and filling in bits of paper or talking on the phone.

She was there for weeks and weeks for no good reason.  I never spoke to a doctor.  I guess there were some.

We tried to get her discharged.  Social Services were a total nightmare.  They thought she should live independently with her own cooking facility.  They wouldn't listen to the family that this was totally unrealistic and downright dangerous.  Homes came to assess her and said she needed nursing care.  Each time social services claimed the homes were wrong - just like the family.

My Mother became depressed, frustrated and uncharacteristically violent to the unpleasant members of staff.

Eventually we raised a formal complaint of institutional abuse by the NHS.  It was series.  They couldn't get that there collective incompetence had resulted in my Mother being stuck on an acute ward where her needs were not understood, not remotely met and her treatment was in effect abuse.",1
"Staff are caring and do a fantastic job in difficult conditions. I think hospital management need to get a grip. I had trouble with the number of instructions and rules. If your child is seriously ill,  you want your family with you, especially your partner. Can't believe that only one partner could stay overnight on ward 16.",2
"I broke and dislocated my ankle at work and found myself in unfamiliar surroundings as home is 20 miles away. What could have been a fairly disconcerting experience was made a positive experience bearing in mind the circumstances. Everyone I encountered from the moment I was treated in majors, through to the porters, surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and all the other staff who make a hospital tick were brilliant. Always friendly and polite. The patience and compassion shown at all times was exemplary and a real credit to the NHS.",5
"Honestly, Heartlands don't get enough credit sometimes. Doctors are attentive, and call regularly to give updates. There are good facilities for treatments as well. They actually care, and I can't be grateful enough to them for looking after my family. Keep it up!",5
MRI scan revealed Prostate Cancer in October 2017.  Discharged on Christmas Eve after a  successful operation to remove the prostate. I can't praise and thank the doctors nurses and all the staff at Heartlands enough. Very caring very efficient very hard working. These wonderful professional people have given me the best chance at continuing my life with my daughters and Grand children. An amazing experience.,5
"I would like to say a huge thank you to all of the health care staff for looking after my Dad. During a very worrying time and not being able to visit him in person due to Covid restrictions, we still managed to contact him via our webchats/video calls and also had the pleasure of meeting and chatting with amazing nurses and healthcare staff. I would also like to praise the volunteers working hard delivering care packages to our loved ones and always being so cheery and helpful.

My Dad is home now and I know he as well as the rest of my family will echo my thanks to all of the amazing staff at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital. THANK YOU :)",5
"The most pathethic hospital i ever attended with arrogant and rude nurses, No emphathy or Symphaty to patients young or elderly' long hours of waiting  with no good treatment. Better go to Sollihull ot Queensway
to",1
"Had to visit a&e a few days ago.  The staff were incredibly nice and professional.  I was well taken care of and they were extremely thorough in getting to the root of my problem.

Update. I had to visit recently and although some staff were ok some weren't as good. The nurse was more inclined to keep telling me me off for fiddling with my face mask than getting to the root of my problem. The doctor I saw didn't really listen to me about my symptoms. He suspected something else, which turned out to be wrong,but my problem is unresolved so what's the point???  I noticed alot of staff just sitting around idle and some not wearing masks while demanding patients do. Not impressed",3
"Car parking is horrendous, spent around an hour along with other cars touring the car park trying to find a space. In the end I had to park in a residential side street. This situation is a regular  occurrence. The management of the hospital should be ashamed of themselves",1
I went to that hospital and the doctors were kind and offered me a drink,5
"My 18 year old son was rushed to hospital after a sudden loss of lots of blood by vomiting. From the moment the ambulance crew arrived to the treatment, this place was amazing !!! Every staff member from Porter to Doctors were brilliant !!! I can only speak as we see and the folks here work extremely hard and they deserve a lot more credit. Everyone was very polite and respectful.
Clearly the resources are stretched everywhere but hats off to the ground staff at Heartlands Hospital.",5
"I wouldn't recommend going to A&E in the evening or night as there won't be many staff and you'll end up waiting forever. I was left after seeing the Nurse and was meant to be moved which I was not informed of, feeling worse.

Went again the next day in the afternoon and a member of staff in particular (a Nurse I believe) called Iram was so friendly and informative. She took my blood test and was patient with me. I hope she is acknowledged for her sincerity which made my experience better (especially because the night before some receptionists in the Major facility weren't even acknowledging patients waiting for 20minutes at the window). Staff like Iram make you feel valued and they carefully inform you instead of being dismissive and not acknowledging you as a human. She gave me the right advice and answered my questions which proffesionalism and care.",4
A and e very bad. toilets not working  lot of people that milking the system,1
"Waiting times in children emergency is just appalling! I spent 3 hours with my 2yo here waiting for the doctor to have a look at his injury. Needless to say, the kid was exhausted, hungry and bored after couple of hours waiting..",1
"This hospital  needs checking,  if you want your love ones to die you can send the patients  in this practice by all means.
looking at the reviews  looks like a race game in this hospital utterly disgusting  behaviour  of staff in general.",1
My 90 year old Mum spent 5 days on Ward 30. I have to say that the nurses and Drs were absolutely amazing with her. They treated her with such compassion and she had nothing but praise for all of them.,5
"Had an appointment at my local surgery and over there they had to call an ambulance for my 7 month baby, because he was coughing, wheezing and breathing quite hard. After 1,5 hours called us for assessment, now still waiting over 5 hours now, maybe another 5 hours wait time, because they want to put patients before us which is really not right, my baby is finding hard to breathe and is coughing so much, but they think that is not serious. Never ever coming to this hospital again.",1
Hi went to new treatment centre for surgery yesterday just want to say a massive thank you to all the staff for their kind and compassion support to the consultant/surgeon Anthethetist and all the theatre staff and ward nurses you are all amazing I cant thank you enough.,5
"My husband had a heart attack last week
We have got to praise the team who looked after him and all the staff on ward 6, I couldn't visit but they kept me informed and allowed my husband to phone when he needed.
The treatment he received was out standing.",5
Terrible as new blind person wouldn't know where ro go,1
"I had an operation here and I left feeling so proud of my local hospital. The staff were excellent and I felt cared for. The building was ultra clean. The woman who took my blood was a pro, so gentle, no bruising - love that woman! Excellent example of the NHS at work.",5
"I have to say that in the past I have had all sorts of problems related to care and service at heartlands, I had vowed never to go back there after I nearly died of excruciating pain waiting for treatment about 3yrs ago. A few days ago I was taken there by ambulance due to a serious episode. Oh my God! Starting with the paramedics, all the way to the cleaning staff were absolutely amazing, due to covid I had no additional support from family but they did more than make up for it. I felt like I was being looked after by my own family! Thank you heartlands, you have restored my faith in humanity. Lots of love and all the best. Xxxx",5
"I have attended Heartlands Retinal Screening service today. On entering I was faced with 2 members of staff not wearing any face coverings / masks. I asked about this and was told, 'oh they do wear masks when they are dealing with patients'.  As I was within 1 metre of one member of staff and slightly further away from the second who were both not wearing masks and both who had been wandering around the entire patient area I explained that as a diabetic I was not prepared to wait and put myself at further risk from these two selfish people who decided that they didn't need to abide by the rules.  l left the hospital, explaining why, even though my appointment was important. How disappointing.",1
"Terrible hospital with terrible staff. I got moved from here from my local hospital and ever since I my health got worse. The nurse that was assigned to me was so rude, my medication was late and when I asked for assistance they wanted me to get up and go to them. They didn’t ask me about my medication, if I’ve ate or about my general well being. I understand that hospitals are under staffed however that doesn’t mean you treat patients disrespectfully and make them feel unwelcome.",1
"I want to say a big thank for the two ladies from Physio who provided me with crutches on Thursday, 17th June and got me started using them. I had just been fitted with a large boot and was pretty shaky at first and they showed true concern. They looked really worried that I had to travel alone in a taxi but I can tell them, I am safely home now.",5
Very poorly run fracture clinic. Only 1 doctor has turned up. Staff are phoning around trying to see where the other 2 are. Atm only 1 doc to see 70+ patients,1
Writing review while waiting been here for nearly 6 hours with my 14 month old daughter. She's so restless and crying. Been told doctors are moving back and forth between adult and chil patients. Definitely wouldn't recommend.,1
Absolutely appalling! We waited a whole 7  hours to just receive the news that we were fine. It’s disgusting how long they keep their patients waiting. One doctor ( LADY) who was in ward 23 with half blond half brown hair  DARK BLUE UNIFORM VERY RUDE.,1
"My daughter has just been referred to hearlands hospital after calling 111 , she has covid but was suffering from pains in her head and neck . On arriving at the hospital the receptionist told her because of having covid she would have to stand outside untill she could be seen by a doctor,  at the time it was pouring down with rain . Why hasn't the hospital got a designated room for covid sufferers? Absolutely disgusted on how my daughter has been treated . Shame on them for their heartless treatment !",1
"A really awful hospital. Upon arrival, my sister was told that the current wait is up to 7 hours but when we looked around the waiting room, it was barely even half full. In discussion with other frustrated patients, they too had similar concerns regarding the efficiency of the hospital and the competence of the doctors. One patient had been waiting for over ten hours only to be told at the Outcome stage that he needs to go back to his GP for a referral. Another lady had been waiting for 8 hours after her initial assessment and when she enquired about a rough time as to when she would be seen by a doctor, she was told that the nurse had taken her off the booking system! The first time I asked when my sister would be seen I was reassured that there are only five patients ahead of her - which seemed fine - but when I asked again 3 hours later, it was still at five patients ahead of her. Neither the doctors nor the nurses had seen any patients in the A&E in three hours!

UPDATE: We are now in our seventh hour of waiting - 1.5hours after I last asked about my sister being seen by a doctor - and the doctor has just called Patient 1 of 5 before her.",1
"Nurses were nice and attentive. Other than that, this place is a shambles. At 3.55am I was close to getting my baby in the car and driving 2 hours to Warrington hospital, where things are more efficient, professional and personable; even when running at 20 times the capacity I experienced at Heartlands, yet again tonight. We left before actually seeing a doctor, as our GP surgery would have been open by the time we expected to be seen, not that we saw one even walking around the whole time we were there. Can't describe how dissapointed and worried my wife and I are.",1
I'm fortunate enough to have all 6 of my children at this lovely hospital. This is our local hospital. 95% of the time their service & attitude towards patients are great. We are lucky to have such a lovely hospital at our locality. All the midwives are really great. They take care of the mothers very well. I would like to thank all the doctors & midwives for their special care & attention. I would like to specially thank our recent Baby's midwife at the time of birth Kate Bearcroft for her kindness & service with a smile.,5
"Well organised, clean and friendly people  ready to help",4
Only give it a star because staff were polite but windows in maple delivery suite were drafy and disgusting and under bed dry blood had to clean it myself even though we told cleaning supervisor blood had been there for 3 days now,2
"Please avoid this hospital! Rude staff everywhere with no emphaty at all... waiting forever to see a doctor... they left me for 8h with covid, pregnant, and painfull leg probably with blood clot! At 00.30 I gave up and left.. bbut of course u only make them a favour... never again!!! What a shame!!!!!",1
"Brilliant staff. From the ambulance staff to the receivers, nurses, doctor, radiologist, and even those who just pushed the beds. Wasn't in good shape when I went in and I was met with a friendly and caring atmosphere. The doctor who saw me pushed my bed herself to save me having to wait for the relevant personel to become available. Was joked with, kept an eye on, and really well accommodated. God bless the NHS and God bless the saints that serve it.
Thank you.",5
The place is not organised. The doctors don't give attention to the patients and even more they leave the patients to stay and get routine in the ward and they are saying: we are taking care of them. But the truth is that the doctors don't even know if the patients are in the right ward and the right department even.,1
"heartlands hospital gastronology department. Patients could be dying in pain nothing  being done . Process very slow urgent scans  being delayed by radiologist  who are deciding  how the  urgent scans should be done even when authorised by doctors.   Patient care by staff are excellent.   Saturday 13th April 2019.   Staffing  is very poor.  Should be more staff One near miss death on Friday 12th April 2019.   Not a care in the world.  . My mum could of died in that hospital due to the x-ray department  staff who are deciding who should have scan and asking what the problem is. They don't need to know .   No care at all.  Constantly chasing people  .  people have died there.

The porters constant complaining about taking patients  is that not their  job to transfer patients where they need to go to.  They get paid for doing their job

Dirtiest hospital I have ever encountered.

Ward 8 ward 18 excellent caring staff I have ever come across they looked after my mum so well. Shame the department is always short staffed.

Moved ward 10 the nurse who left my mum on bed pan left blankets off did not close the privacy  curtains  and just left. Would you want your mum treated like that. No dignity no privacy unethical.  You are in the wrong job if you can not take the heat leave . Hope you get stripped off by your title. April  2019ĺ

I would like to know which sick woman stood in the door of room 2 side room  gave my mum the Zimmer frame and told her to get up by herself when my mum was struggling  to get up they stood and watched her struggle. I hope someone does that to your loved one. If  I knew earlier about this you would not see tomorrow.  This is ward  10. Kathleen thank you for looking after my mum and taking over in looking after her. Same goes to the other kind staff.",1
"It's horrible, we waited more than 7 hours just to quickly check a kid, apparently in other hospital it's the same. In France, you will never wait that much in emergency. NHS definitely need to review the process in their hospital",1
I went to the A&E yesterday with my dad and it was THE most terrible hospital department i have ever been to. My dad had sever chest pains and we had to wait for 7 HOURS to get seen by the doctor to tell us what happened. The staff took so long that people actually left before they had even been called to be seen. This department really needs to be organised and handled better. If it continues this way there will be no choice but to protest against this grossly horrible managed hospital. I hope this review makes some change into this horrendous excuse of a hospital!,1
"Very bad  experience at the A&E, not personal enough, Four toilets all out of order and the only working toilet was dirty and filthy. My disabled mother was waiting for very long time to be seen with a big gash to her leg. When I asked how long we have to wait the receptionist was not very friendly and argumentative. Also my mother was not given an anaesthetic to stitch up her leg..to save on what .....!? I don't know but it left my mother in so much pain and distress. Never want to go there again.",1
"My wife who is a
Confirmed cancer patient was admitted to ward 12 for a food tube to be inserted as she was unable to eat any thing other than liquids. She as now been there 24 hours and they have done nothing. This includes giving her anything she could swallow as a food substance. They are letting her starve. All my respect for the nhs that they have worked so hard to get as gone. If any thing happens to her as a result of NO treatment I will be taking legal action",1
"My experience of treatment has been good.  But trying to park since they changed visiting times can be a nightmare, especially if you are a day patient.  I've been sent out of the car park on arrival because there were no spaces and left to find parking off the main road.

How can the nhs expect to process patients in a timely and efficient  manner if facilities for patients are unpredictable and frustrating. Never mind the anxiety you experience at a time when you need too feel relaxed and positive.",3
Pls people be aware  of these horrible nurses on this ward the use covied as a exercise. On my moms ward records  there was notes made abt mom .we was not told abt there are lieing evil nurses on this ward zarah the young  girl on there didn't  tell us my mom was dying instead  she told my family  my mom was stable and resting they didn't  let us come to sit with our mom the head nurse is the most evil nurse she wouldn't  let us sit with my mom even after my mom Passed awy,1
"Its an amazing hospital, doing great even under shortage of staff and funds. I had my baby there, it was a lovely experience with all the cooperative staff. I had my chemo's there . Had to wait long hours but it was obvious from the number from patients they had. I thank them all, very compassionate people.",5
"No disabled bays, or any other bays fir that matter, and took an agreement to exit carpark after showing badges at reception ( new rule for disabled people) must be shown IN PERSON BY BADGE HOLDER !!",2
"As much as I appreciate hospital staff are extremely busy my partner and I are very disappointed with the length of time we had to wait to speak to somebody regarding his elderly mother who was admitted this morning (no answer at all)
The patient enquiry department after 34mins still hadn't picked up the phone!!!!!! Either they need more staff /phones or enquiries should be dealt with more quickly. Absolutely disgraceful !!! communication waiting time definitely needs to be addressed.",1
"Brilliant turnaround by A&E , Majors unit given the circumstances of Covid - 19.  I received fast and active care and treatment during my short stay before being taken to a clean ward.
Excellent service by all emergency services and one massive thanks to you all for my care and treatment 😷👍👋",5
"Wife taken in by ambulance Sat a.m.. Virtually impossible to call and get information by Mon p.m It's like she's none of my business any more. I still don't know what's wrong with her. Disabled bays near door, parking payment meters at the bottom of a slope. How do I get my wheelchair back up the slope? Cars exiting, led around in sharp curve, leaves cars at an angle, where you can't put your ticket in the exit machine. Feels like the place is run by half wits. Now Tuesday, and I still don't know what's wrong with my Wife. Dismissive answers on the phone.",2
"Massive thankyou to the team at ward 18 for looking after me. You were all brilliant.
Love from the buscuit loving deaf guy xx",5
"The service I had this time was good. The staff were helpful, and the information I was given was very good.",4
Went here after my partner had an unexpected seizure in his car. Waiting 4 hours for a&e to be told it was up to a 15 hour wait and if it wasn't an emergency to see our gp. Gone home still worried and not knowing why he has a seizure. Very upset.,1
Excellent efficient service. I was in A&E because of a broken bone in my foot - they saw and treated me within 2 hours.  I was honestly prepared for a 4 hour wait!  Their orthopaedics department is efficient and provide an excellent level of service with very friendly practitioners.  Really good experience - although its a shame I still have a broken foot!,5
"Can i just say wow! Im currently sat in accident and emergency and I can not be thankful enough to the amazing staff working so hard to get everyone seen.
They have been unbelievably efficient....thank you so much for all your hard work. Your all wonderful.",5
"My mother who is terminally ill, waited in a&e for 1w hours, cring woth pain and unabke to sot. These couldn3 provide bed.
We pay every tax, you can name in this country.
Is this how we public get treated?
SHAME ON YOU,
WHAT MAKE YOU GREAT BRITIAN?",1
I could not speak more highly of the care given to my mother while she has been in she is just starting on her 3rd week an everyone has been wonderful. Some call it heartless hospital!! Not us they have been exceptional 110%. Keep up the good work.,5
"I have been there for the first scan for maternity. The staff was kind but ultra-stressed, I had a ultraquick explanation from the midwife about exams and things to do; she gave me some telephone numbers for urgencies and they are not actually working properly. I have issues in order to cancel appointments now that I asked to be relocated in another hospital.",2
"Laughed out of this hospital by a nurse after being rushed to A&E for urgent assessment in one hour. Left doubled over screaming in agony in the waiting room, she made it quite clear that I was wasting her time. In the end she made me feel so humiliated I left in floods of tears.

And get this. I am writing this from a hospital bed after emergency surgery to remove a 13cm complex cyst, and had suggested ovarian torsions so at 28 I have lost an ovary and a tube. I went sent to a & e with suspected torsion all that time ago.

Don't bother. Very traumatic experience and would not feel safe going to Heartlands anymore. Nearly cost me my life.",1
"Lazy nurses, wife was well looked after at the delivary suit, wish stayed their longer. Once in the new ward they dont care the fact the mother cant get up after her C section and my tiny baby not being looked after.",1
"I had the bad idea to accept a job offer from this hospital: never seen such a dirty place in all my lifetime. Operating rooms without hygienic treatment, hospitalisation divisions full of infections, hip prosthesis as old as one could see in the ‘70s of the last century. Furthermore, the worst consultants I ever met.",1
"I was discharged from this hospital on Sunday 12th August, 2018, after a 5 night stay. I have never been treated at this hospital before, normally attending The QE, however specialist constraints made it necessary to be treated at The Heartlands.
A fantastic place with fantastic staff, the food was excellent (it's a hospital not a hotel). I was on ward 5, and could not have been looked after any better anywhere. From being booked in on the day surgery/care ward at 8am on the Tuesday morning, through waking up in recovery post op, to being transferred to ward 5 and spending the next 5 nights on ward 5, everyone I encountered from drs, to nurses, and house staff were nothing less than brilliant. All the staff with a special mention to a Staff nurse named Zoe, showed why the NHS continues to exist whilst under such pressure through lack of resources and necessary staff. I am extremely grateful to my consultant Mr Ahmad for his skill, and to all other staff I encountered for their professionalism and dedication. Thank you...",5
I came into the hospital via ambulance and was seen by the hospital staff very quickly which probably saved my life. They quickly sent me to angioplasty theatre where a stent was inserted to my blocked arteries. Thank you very much to all the team. Specially ward 6 staff who gave me breakfast at 1230am as I was very hungry and couldn’t go to sleep.,5
"Incompetent staff, allowed a mental health patient discharge themselves and wonder the streets for 2 hours because they and the police are unable to do their jobs correctly. Amazing how fast the police then found the person as they knew they would have been held accountable. Fix up",1
"This place is a disgrace, terrible, abysmal - got here at midnight, still sitting here 10 hours later. Only one doctor on shift with hundreds of people waiting. I will never set foot in this hospital again.",1
"Terrible patient service...... I went in with my 75 year old mother who was told by the GP to go to A&E. I don't want to go into this horrible experience but she couldnt walk due to a knee injury and there was no wheelchair to be found, to be told by rude arrogant staff there is nothing they could do, then was send to the wrong department 3 times where my mom couldnt walk. Never seen my mother cry so much it was heart breaking. eventually after a 6 hour wait dr saw her. The Dr was lovely but the whole experience, the customer service, the patient care was awful. I would hate to be left in the hands of these cruel and unsympathetic people. GOD HELP THE NHS.....",1
"Wouldn't even know where to start, feel very sorry for the few staff that make an effort. If you have an issue write to the Care Quality Commission, it's the only way to spark off further investigations into this awful hospital.",1
Horrible hospital. I had gallbladder pains for months and months I was rolling around on the floor in agony Projectile vomiting. And I was sent home and was told to take paracetamol. This happened on numerous occasions eventually one of the gallstones got stuck in my tubes and caused serious pains to a point I was passing out so I had to have them operated on immediately. I felt like I was ignored every time I came to the hospital. I’m glad Iv had them removed now but this issue could of been resolved a lot sooner,1
"Again family member re admitted due to being discharged too early. Tonight have phoned main number & am still waiting on the phone 22 mins  &  still counting)for an answer from admissions so I can locate which ward family member has been admitted to.
Utterly disgraceful, really not looking forward to having to deal with all this incompetence whilst worried about a seriously ill family member. I am going to put a complaint into this hospital.  If its handled as its calls are I hold out no hope.
Any chance you get choose a hospital which at least answers its calls",1
"Firstly I went to A&E recently and it was quick and efficient, I had no issues with the service.

The one star is for the communications which is non existent. My father was admitted, caught covid on a ward (ward 11),
got transferred to a covid ward (ward 29). The nurses were very  helpful in establishing contact via an iPad i had sent in. The ward had a mobile phone which was pointless because no one answers the phone and they were using mobile data and not hospital wifi when using watsap- which genius decided this was a good idea? it was giff gaff mobile data aswell - you simply can't make this stuff up.

The issue is they don't bother keeping relatives informed and updated, constantly having to phone and they don't answer or it is engaged - so much effort and energy is expended just trying to get an update on how your loved one is doing. It truly is unacceptable putting relatives through undue stress and anguish. I appreciate they are busy but surely it's not beyond their gift to sort out communications especially at a time when visitors are not allowed.

it beggars belief that an effective communications strategy is not in place 10 months on since the start of the pandemic.",1
"Appalling. Waiting room full of people (and children) some of whome had been waiting hours to be seen. We were told there could be a 4 +hour wait to be seen as there was 'a poorly child bought In' surely if we are bringing in children at 9pm at night we as parents would consider our child as poorly too but with out being seen how do they know there was not an emergency seated in their waiting room... As a children's A&E should they not be capable of treating more than one emergency at a time?!? I feared something may be blocking my daughter's airway, after initially being checked we were asked to wait for what could be 4 hours for someone to listen to her chest...4 hours!!! For someone do do something that takes a matter of seconds just to get the all clear and be out of their way to treat other emergencies. This is the second visit to heartlands children's A&E and we were told a similar thing last time after waiting almost 5 hours to be seen. Not good at all.",1
"Sent to paediatric A&E by 111. Sent to clinic 9 by A&E, sent back to A&E by clinic 9, misdirected to Ward 14 who didn't answer the door, told by a nurse there ""isn't a paediatric A&E here"". Walked back to the beginning with an injured 5 year old and greeted with an ""oh sorry"" by the first nurse we saw. And in a waiting room with 2 parents not wearing masks, with one openly coughing and with no staff challenging them. If I contract Covid, this is where from (my 5 year old and myself are wearing masks).
Then after an hour of waiting, they lost my son's paperwork, so we had to start from scratch?",1
"Switchboard staff are extremely rude. They'll transfer you to any department just to get rid of you. When I asked for the ladies name when trying to have a civilised conversation with her she became defensive and aggressive. I asked for her manager. The manager yvvone pollard was more rude than her! Immediately defending her colleague without hearing my side of the story. Think they must be friends. Extremely unprofessional, retraining is required for all. Still don't know the ladies name I wanted to complain about.",1
"Disappointing continuity of care and communication for my father. He was admitted with a seizure. ED care was varied from excellent(senior medic took history and was genuinely interested) to degrading (my mum being told to walk my father down Majors to clean him up after he had had accident (he has dementia are was having D&V following seizure) My mum had to then clean him down with no proper products to do so she then had to leave him on his own in bathroom while she asked for pad for him. Since then he had been moved 3 times, communication from ward (29) has been none existent unless we phone and even then its a different story and very time. No urine or stool samples taken no explanation as to why his potassium is low the list is endless on the one occasion a doctor did phone to ask my mum why he was confused she hadn't even realised he had dementia, Trust excuse 'probably a young doctor who had not read notes!'. Astounded by this excuse from PALS.
I work for this Trust and I am ashamed of the standard of care and communication given to dementia patients and family, especially during this difficult period with no visitors allowed. Frankly horrified.",2
"The care for my son who was run over by a car has been second to non. Amazing staff, and care throughout.",5
"This hospitals A&E department is negligent as only 1 doctor allocated. Prisoners get better healthcare, maybe they should privatise healthcare as what we have now is awful.",1
"At A and E yesterday with my 96year old mom.The doctor named Adam was so kind and understanding with her,explained and treated her with care.",4
I cannot give these staff at the childrens A&e department enough thankyous’. Not only did they help my little boy after his accident but also helped me at the same time (not what I expected to happen!) amazing place.,5
"My Son has been in 3 times during Covid and now 4th, my Husband went up the first time was told to go to Security and leave Son's Pj's they sent him up to the ward to deliver, my husband was one of the few wearing mask and gloves, when they sent Son home had to re-admit within 5hrs. Move forward 4 weeks, in again had to take him something, this time had to fill out a form for someone else (Staff) to take to ward, My Son has not received it Lost In Transit, the times my husband has been hardly seen anyone in corridors in PPE. They were going to discharge my son 2 days ago said medically fit, was still ill and put back on drips.",1
"DO NOT ENTER IF YOU HAVE A PERSISTENT COUGH - clearly printed outside the main entrance.

1:54pm 26/09/2020

In the A&E department ( children ) there’s a child persistently coughing, Not only I but every other parent complained to the receptionist to keep that child in a separate room or cubicle.

UNPROFESSIONAL receptionist apparently doesn’t seem to be bothered !!!!!!!!

They’re putting all the other parents and children at risk.
Doesn’t matter if the cough is COVID19 related or not, Mrs RECEPTIONIST at least DO YOUR part to keep the others safe.",1
"Wouldnt even give 1 star. To the staff at the reception.  Not polite, and they ask u for all ur personal details infront of everyone ans expect you shout your details out.
A elderly couple was brought in with covid and left at reception without the rec or staff been informed of their situation of been covid positive.",1
visited heartlands this morning with an ankle problem. L was seen x-ray and reviewed in less than two hours. Fantastic guys.....cant praise you enough.,5
Absolutely Awful. I went to what was meant to be my 12 week scan but ended up being my 15 week scan. Then they  had the nerve to call me and say I didn’t turn up to my scan. Now there not telling me when my next scan is and I’m nearly 20 weeks pregnant. Big mistake on choosing this hospital to give birth in.,1
"Waiting time ridiculous. Unhelpful staff members. Not a very well kept hospital, staff members need 're training. Maternity ward is horrendous bad experience overall.

Recently Nov took the children in to be seen at the Badger clinic Heartlands Hopsital Horrendous waiting times 8 hours from Doctors to Paediatrics department at ward 15. Junior Doctor lacked communication skills aswell as a good grasp of what was going on. Very unprofessional with his approach.",1
"Always been good to me and my family. Sadly now EDITED Drs need to be trained on how to deal and speak to disabled adults, the Dr in a and e had the nerve to tell me that I shouldn't presume my severely autistic 23 year old non verbal son he's in pain just by his face? Really I know my son hes also lost 4st in 7 months, dr asked me numerous times if he could.talk I'm telling you no, my son had been in pain for months with his face and jaw he had a tooth extraction but was still in agony, dentist said look I've done xrays looked at his teeth nothing wrong, now turns out my son has trigeminal neuralgia! I'm disgusted he has no understanding of autism and told me.to get him.a sandwich and give him ibuprofen! He's never eaten a sandwich in his life 🙄",1
"Worst hospital I have ever known. I've had regular appointments there for the past 6 months and it never goes smoothly. They've made me feel worse by causing stress than actually getting me better. Never call when they say they will, can't find anyone cause none of the receptionists actually know who works there, I've even been told by a receptionist to just go around asking the doctors their names to see if I can catch the doctor I was looking for. As soon as I get my biopsy results (Which is now already 2 weeks later than they said, and they sent me a letter saying I'm going to have to wait another month!!!!!!) I'm going QE. I could set up a better hospital at home.",1
"Doesn’t even deserve a one star! Appalling  service and the staff there are so rude! No compassion or care what so ever, it’s like they just want to get paid and go home. They neglect a lot of the elderly patients and fail to provide a standard duty of care. Do not go here…",1
"I was admitted by ambulance having passed out in a pool of blood with a suspected ruptured ovary.I was admitted in severe pain at 5pm and despite begging for pain relief at all was not even offered paracetamol until midnight by which point I had passed out three more times with the pain.To add insult to injury I was asked to walk to a different part of the building for assessment which required a 5 mins walk around the building despite heavy blood loss and blackouts. Thoroughly disgusted by the treatment!

heavily",2
I am so thankful to each person who had a part in taking care of my dad. From the ambulance crew to the nurses and Dr's and all the people who get forgotten. Thank you so much for getting him home to us. They all do a tuff job trying to figure out what is going on with someone when they are very ill and I for one am proud of our NHS and all the staff. Rather than moan about the treatment and service remember they are life savers trying to save lives. If you are able to moan about the care you receive then you we're probably in the wrong place. Thank you Heartlands Hospital and the NHS!!!,4
I was taken to this hospital on monday 9th November with serious chest pains and E.C.G. showing abnormal on arrival I spent 6 hours outside A&E in a ambulance not a issue paramedics was brilliant my issues started when I was taken into resus they took blood put me on antibiotics and steroids and nebulizer due to my copd then took me for a xray after all this had been done I was told I'd be kept in I asked for a cup of coffee and a sandwich as I'd been there 14 hours 6 hours outside in ambulance and 8 hours in resus after repeatedly asking different members of staff and just being told give us a minute I never got my coffee or sandwich I was so hungry and thirsty I had to leave the hospital at 5am in the morning and get a taxi home so I could eat and have a drink staff was realy nasty they meant to care and help people I told them I would rather die at home with people around me who care than die on a trolley in resus were staff ignore you they was not even busy cubicles empty and staff just walking round but couldnt make me a coffee after 14 hours having nothing to eat or drink were is the care there I would never go to heartlands again,1
"Went in because I had a bad reaction to prescribed medication only to find out they had put recreational drug overdose on my records, not happy plus the staff can be very rude and change the decision made by a previous Dr without notice, the toilets had you no what covered in it, disgusting",1
"The WORST hospital in all of Midlands. Laziest staff, don’t even follow protocol for patients and try to intimidate patients into sitting in pain for 8 hours without asking even simple questions or informing them of new symptoms. No sympathy or care, just sadistic people who obviously chose the profession for a income and to laugh at patients in pain",1
"I cannot knock them at all. My wife had a lot of complications during pregnancy which including having a pulmonary embolism, strep B and stagnant growth which resulted in significantly more scans and appointments. The bloods department coordinated exceptionally with the maternity unit, we were never messed around, everything went smoothly and i genuinely couldnt expect a better service. Even during labour they were great; very supportive midwives who knew what they were doing and the doctors were fantastic. Once on the ward, the midwives were phenomenal and exceptionally supportive. 10/10.
p.s. #saveNHS",5
The A&E adult staff was really bad and grumpy always .. the only relief was the night security guard ‘Mark’ I think .. running around everywhere and helping people who came on emergency and offering kind words every time you speak to him throughout the night .. kudos  man you are awesome than the treatment itself,3
"Awful excuse of a hospital, I understand A&E  is very busy and I appreciate the hours the staff put in. However, you sent my partner home after having seizures telling her she has a headache and there is nothing “clinically wrong”. We have taken her to the AMAZING QE hospital where she has received a diagnosis. The only polite member of staff was one of the porters who had happy spirits. The dr that sent us home was rude, reluctant to listen to us and very brief. No tests performed not even a blood test. Biggest waste of 6 hours ever. Discrace to the NHS.",1
"What a dirty, filthy hell hole A&E is!! I am absolutely disgusted! From the toilets to the relatives room they were using for consultations, were disgusting!! The corridors were filled with people on trolleys which was very distressing for my daughter who has Aspergers and ADHD, it took 2 and a half hours to be seen by the most uncaring nurse I’ve ever had the displeasure to meet, despite the fact that my daughter was brought in after feeling that her life wasn’t worth living and took an over dose and that was just the initial consultation! We’ve been here 8 hours now and we’ve only just seen a doctor!! And top it all off we had to dispose of the several bowls that my daughter used to vomited in in the waiting room ourselves!! Appalled doesn’t even begin to cover how I feel!! Apart from ONE nurse that was kind and explained everything to her every other member of staff we encountered was patronising and made her feel like she was a time waster!!",1
I had a mixed experience with heartlands! This month I delivered a baby girl in heartlands and I think maternity unit has to improve a lot ... I know it’s a busy hospital but I learnt that they’re always in a hurry so they try to finish off the case ASAP and that is the reason why they do more number of assisted deliveries using forceps or ventouse... The worst part for me was gas and air ... this thing literally makes the delivery tiresome.. inspite of telling the midwife that I won’t use gas and air.. she didn’t budge!!! Her decision made my delivery painful n ended up in going for assisted delivery instead of normal. The lady doc who was present looked useless!!! She was overconfident! I must say Pediatrics department is wonderful.. 5 star for them,3
"Not my experience but my poor sister in-laws , she had had pains in her stomach for 4 days , she had to phone her local surgery to try to get an answer let alone an appointment eventually she got 1 after persistent begging , she was told to go to hospital , she arrived at 7 am New Year’s Eve she wasn’t scanned until around 8pm the had to wait for another scan , was told it’s your appendix so you’ll have to have surgery , was left all day waiting , was prepped at around 5 pm told surgery will be 6.30 pm and surprise it’s been canceled 😡 shed had no food no drinks until after 6.30 pm New Year’s Day , so should of been 20 nurses on but 12 went sick so that left 8 🤔 obv didn’t want work New Year’s Eve , but want a pay rise 😡 a dog would be treated better 😡 an utter disgrace of a hospital 😡",1
"Heartlands - should be called HEARTLESS . Make you suffer . I was admitted into hospital being diagnosed with appendicitis at a urgent care centre and referred by them to go to Heartlands ASAP on the night of New Year’s Eve. Even giving them a letter from them I was still waiting for several hours to be seen and even though I had already been diagnosed they didn’t think I had appendicitis but when my blood results came back they found that i am suffering from appendicitis.
Anyway I got admitted into ward 12 as was told I would be operated at 8am so I can’t eat or drink and I was ok with that . Then was told that I should be operated early afternoon . Due to me not being well I didn’t eat or drink before that anyway. But because I was on morphine I tried sleeping it off anyhow . It wasn’t till 9:30pm that I had enough of waiting and asked I will be operated today as all I kept being told was I’m next on the waiting list. Then I was take for sugery. What really annoyed me was they wanted me to go home in the afternoon less than 24 hours of my op.  After speaking to the nurse I told her I didn’t feel that I should go home because I needed care and because my family members all work I won’t be able to look after myself . So Dr Sabrina Kapadia (FYI Doctor) came to see me and said she will write me a discharge letter but she is happy with me staying a night so that I am able to go home the next day. However soon after someone called Bernie who is a surgical bed manager came to me and spoke to me in a very bad manner and told me I have to go now . She was so arrogant and didn’t care about me . Even after I refused to be discharged . I told her that its fine even though I’ve been operated less than 24 hours ago but I’ll need to wait till my family members finish work and come to collect me. Instead of waiting for my family they still discharged me and didn’t finish my treatment of . I had antibiotics that was on a drip they disconnected that and made me go to a discharge lounge . I am in so much pain and struggling to do anything . For future I would rather let my self die rather than go to Heartlands hospital. They should be closed down. Spoke to many patients and they were all complaining . Hate this hospital with a passion . P.s they don’t even deserve the 1 star.. oh and they didn’t have clean bedding as they run out of them ... Close down heartlands . !!!",1
"Went to A&E as I had self harmed and was advised to go there to get help as I also have plans to kill myself. The first person who saw me was brilliant. Got the mental health services team to come speak to me, they were so rude, made me bring up past trauma, I told them if I left and was sent home I would self harm again and there was a high chance I would try and kill myself and they sent me home and said what I had done wasn’t serious enough!",2
"Was worried when we got to hospital, but all that was taken away with the lovely staff who made you feel at ease. They were wonderful, really helpful and friendly. It was a long day , but we could not have had better treatment anywhere else. A big thank you to all.",5
"Thank you so much to the doctors, nurses, surgeons and everyone who looked after my husband in the Cardiology department, after his heart attack. Especially those in Ward 6. You saved his life, treated him so well and were very kind.",5
"Ward 20
Pick up the phone!!
I can't visit the ward and I can not talk to staff.
Doctor never calls back.
Pick up the phone or let us visit.
So we can see what is going on with their care.",1
You know your own body when you are unwell. Absolutely disgusting treatment of people at this hospital. Everyone has the right to healthcare. However according to the drs in A and E no you don't. Excuses after excuses.,1
Worsed hospital I've come across they have the cheek to ask patients and visitors to been clean and wear masks when they clearly dont do it themselves and why do they allow staff to arrive and go home in there uniform then attend to patients . My dad had really poor care and bad important decisions made and then today had to be rushed back in again .will be writing a formal letter of complaints of these people who work there shouldn't have the honour of been clapped for as they clearly don't care as there attitude reflects that .,1
A HUGE thank you for the care and support from ward 19. My lovely Doctor was fantastic. You guys are amazing. Thank you.,5
"I've been very fortunate to not need treatment in this hospital. I have family members who have , one who sadly passed away , treatment on this occasion was abysmal. Communication with this hospital has got to be the worst , you get passed from one member of staff to another and end up doing a circle of about 8 arriving back at same person who knew absolutely nothing! Do you really get paid to do this , surely basic knowledge of your department and what role an individual works in , so instead of I don't know ! It's nothing to do with me ! Well put me through to the right person! In the meantime while your scratching your heads and passing it onto someone else who you know can't deal with it , I have a family member who may not have time to be messed about like this. Each time I have communication from this hospital it's always negative. Can see why private medical care is the way to go with hospitals like this .
Never experienced this with QE, who are definitely well organised and just a pleasure to deal with .",1
"My father was treated for a collapse lung and fluid on the lung and fluid arround the heart in all he spent 2 weeks in Hartlands Hospital and I cannot thank all the staff and doctors from wards 9 24 and 26 who saved  my dad life who will be 92 in a few weeks
Thank you thank you all the doctors and staff from Hartlands",4
The nursing staff and doctors are so friendly and go out their way to help. But you can see due to ever decreasing funds they are stretched. The car park is usually full during peak times and there is little parking around the hospital.,4
"My dad was rushed to the heartlands hospital, they didn't give him much of a chance but just over a week now my dad is doing great. The staff are wonderful, very helpful and they care for their patients. Thank you ward 6 xx",5
very impressed with speed and efficiency of a+e department i seemed to be seen and assessed very quickly. The staff were kind and showed empathy overall i was really happy with the care i was given.,5
Went to adult A&E obviously due to an emergency after speaking to my GP first. The doctor eventually seen me after 4 hour wait which was not a problem. Then issued me with a hospital only prescription for medication i really needed knowing the hospital pharmacy was closed. I told doctor that my local pharmacy had the medication in stock but needed the prescription written on a non hospital only prescription but Dr Mohammed just wanted to be difficult. Even though i told him the pharmacy was closing soon and they would wait for me to come with the prescription he delayed writing it out for another 2 hours. Perfect example of why the NHS is drowning employing incompetent monkeys from the third world who get a power trip messing with people.,1
Ward visit was clean tidy,5
This hospital is disgrace. Staff in A&E is totally out of this world. They are rude non considerate and no professional. They act more like security guards rather than health workers. Bad experience in every way.,1
"Sent to attend A&E by my GP I was in agony a SEVEN HOURS wait in A&E to see a DR & NINE HOURS wait to see a surgeon ""We only have one surgeon & he is doing incoming emergencies ""Dried vomit at the entrance, filth everywhere SCRAP THE NHS it is clearly no fit for purpose. Would Matt Hancock MP State for Health and Social Care be happy if it was him or one of his family? No they go private he needs to try it himself and then tell us it works!!!",1
I was on ward 1 due to a few problems was sent from a&e I was there a good while but I got treated and got better everyone slates this hosptail but can not fault nothing today and to get discharged in same day bouns . And me and my unborn baby are all well so hands up heartlands and everywhere was clean thank u to all the nurses on ward one Easing my mind as I really hate hosptails .i will be having my baby here so hope all stays the same well done :),5
"I'm begging you stay away.
This hospital is horrible food is disgusting.
No one cares that you are in pain.
Nurses will rather have a chat than look after you.
Doctors think that they are gods they will take no responsibility for their words they'll promise you something and it will never happen.
I really don't feel safe here.
I've met 2 nurses and 1 good and trust worthy doctor rest of the staff WILL make jokes about you they will laugh at you behind your back. LAST NIGHT ONE GUY TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF BECAUSE OF THE ""CARE"" HE RECEIVED.",1
"Pretty bad experience - A&E took us to the children's a&e for my daughter - they looked at her in an hours time but then the followup itself took 2.5 hours which is crazy... Then they got us into the children assessment unit ward 15 and we spent 6 hours there to be seen by the senior doctor and were told the our daughter needs to stay overnight! Before that we were told that she looks fine and probably will send her home...  When I asked the staff and I quote ""Can you please let me know the time when I came into the A&E?"" They responded with - ""Why""? ""What for?"" ""Its not going to do anything?"" I said ""I just want to know"" They said ""You should not be standing here - they are discussing other patients - its confidential information"" to which I replied ""This place should not be public if that is the case - could you let me know please?"" And I moved on - they acknowledged the request but still did not tell me.",1
"They have closed the sleep apnea testing and sleep disorders clinics so patients can't have testing done or get a CPAP machine. They have been closed since March 2020 this is terrible they are letting people down who have sleep conditions. I have phoned 3 other hospitals in the West Midlands and they are still open and seeing patients.

We know COVID has been devastating but what about other patients that need to been seen and have health problems we are just left to suffer or die.

Do you know when you are going to open the sleep apnea clinic so people can be seen and get CPAP or the treatment they need if other hospitals can still continue the service why can't you!",1
"Good service, complicated layout though!",5
Pharmacy staffs are very nice,4
"Disgusting service in A&E tonight went with my partner who's in alot of pain with an injury he done at work can just about walk! Waited at least 3 hours to go up and ask how much longer to be told other people that came in after us was put above him because they have an illness and he just has an injury, very disgusted!! The toilets could do with a good clean too, had to clean them myself before letting my 5year old daughter use the toilet blood and urine all over the seat and floor vile!! Seriously go somewhere else I would rather suffer!!",1
Busy but restaurant serves great food,5
"Some of the nurses do not seem to be interested on ward 29 there is no urgency to aid some of the patients to go to the toilets.
(It seems some nurses have bad backs)",2
its fully understandable there seems to be shortage of staff but when phoning there needs to be a better form of communication as it does take to long or someone cuts you off.,3
"I experienced the best of care from the Endocrine nurses Sadaff and Lisa when in for a long day of tests. The Diabetes and Endocrine unit is separate from the main hospital, in a clean airy architecturally interesting purpose built space. The staff appear to be - without exception - friendly, helpful and professional.",5
"0/5 - it is NOT SAFE.
1. miss to do vital tests in ED on patients e.g sugar levels on a diabetic confused. most doctors are temprorary
2. security are a law unto themselves - they can assult you, not visible as a security,  and never goes to court - you have to drop the case of will affect your own police check DBS record, as a victum!
3. HCA in outpatient are rude and not polite - one did not even have facemask on like some security guards.
4. death rate above average. check the offical figures yourself to see how sky high it is.
5. expensive parking!!",1
Mom had a sroke and ambulance was with us in under 10 minutes and driver and assistant assessed mom with care and proffessionalism. Blue lighted her to heartlands. We followed and by the time we had parked and ran to a and e mom was in a cubicle and being monitored. Scanned within an hour and results shortly after. Can not thank the teams at heartlands enough from the ambulance staff to the team waiting for her. Can only remember the name Denver and she was so calm and compassionate as were every member of staff that helped mom. Yes there were people on beds in the corridors and the staff wete over stretched as we all well know. You are all true angels. Thank you. Mom had the stroke friday 17:00 on 05.01.18,5
Worst service and attitude by the staff. Very poorly managed.,1
Very good  hospital but they charge to much for car park,5
"Renal ward staff very rude ! Don't know here name so describing her of anyone else has had a bad experience with her!  short , middle aged seems to be of philepine. She doesn't know how to speak discusting attitude!!!",1
"All day staff are very good, hospital where i am is quite clean. Night-time is pretty Grim and under resourced, noisey as you would expect. Night Nurse on ward 8 was not very keen to offer help or friendly to patients, always ignoring the calls and alarms or deferring jobs to the carer Abdul, who was more helpful and willing.

Worst thing of all is the distinct lack of kind and caring staff at night time.

They either try and ignore you a lot of the time or when you need something, promise to return and do something so as they can turn bell off and never return.
One female carer on A&E when I first arrived was more concerned about losing her job than to be bothered if it was safe move me to, so as I didn't choke... So I thought I found a gem, then she followed it up with ""I'm don't want to lose my job over you choking on a piece of toast"". :-o",3
"Was seen at Badger, Solihull and transferred  with handwritten referral to Heartlands on 30.07.12. I was treated with great kindness on Ward 11. Although I was there for some time I was reassured that all was being done to diagnose my illness by all staff concerned. Luckily I was discharged with medication and an out-patient appointment.I cannot praise the hospital enough. Btw the toilets etc were spotless!!",5
"Just yesterday I left hospital, I can't be more then greatful for care given by nurses Nadia and Ade also Philippine HCA  from ward 22 whom look after myself such a caring and lovely people. Also Bulgarian  doctor (unfortunatelly I  can remember his name) who was looking after me , I can call him WALKING ANGEL, amazing very very caring and devoted doctor.

Unfortunately on my last day I had very disrespectful nurse  on the front of patients she was undermining doctor words she was so unpleasant. Also she was treating me as nobody, just because she's  tall and big'ish she thought that she has a power, unfortunatelly for her this is not the way, and that's is why people have bad reputation about this hospital.

This 5 stars is for all lovely people who was looking after me with respect and dignity!",5
"My very frail grandma who suffers from Alzheimer’s were discharged with a needle hanging out of their arm after a short stay at the hospital. After calling the ward, we were told that the staff had forgotten to remove it. Shocking to say the least.",1
"Had emergency c section on the 12.12.18 and i honestly can say the staff members from Willow suite were fab,and delivered my little boy safely.Stayed on the Aspen ward for few nights and i was really happy with the care and support i received.Big thank you to all the amazing hard working members of staff.",5
"Worst hospital ever the maternity unit reception and the security staff. They assault people and very rude and obsessed with covid.  The security is none helpful, sad Muppets that don't know how to deal with the public.",1
"all staff,doctors,nursesporters,cleaning staff excellent. only gripe l have is parking l dont pay for it but l am disabled, and as it should be parking is at front and disabled parking at the top which you have to walk down to office to tell them exempt from paying so l struggle to walk but my dad been in hospital, a lot lately so l visit twice a day and l still have to go to office to tell them to put me on the wall so l can go through the barrier, which isnt easy as l have to walk through hospital to the ward l want and then at least once walk to the office to tell them my name. why have a disabled parking area up a hill.srely the reason for disabled parking is to make it easier for people who cant walk. having said all that well done nursing staff  xx",5
"A&E urgent care-refereed by gp
Absolutely disgusting treatment they gave me, I walked out I would rather die in a gutter that go back
I have been a nurse for 25 years and I would never treat a patient the way they did
One nurse short red hair in assessment unit I am coming for your PIN number when I recover from this chest infection that I have treated myself
You should hang your heads in shame",1
A very caring and professional team looked after our Mom on ward 17. They enabled us to see her on a zoom call when we were not able to visit because of Covid 19. She was very well looked after and her medical needs were taken care of with great skill and wisdom.,5
I went to the children's A&E....luckily got seen in 10 mins and the staff was so polite..really happy with the service today.,5
"I took my wife Catherine Kilmister To Heartlands hospital, out patients clinic 6,  8th January 2019 for a 3.00pm appointment. We arrived 20 minutes early and was told there was a little delay, 5.15pm my wife finally got in to see a doctor. What really upset us was a group of 3 assistants standing around the receptionist giggling and laughing. There was no apology except from a sister when we came out. On top of this it cost us £5.10 for parking. Not impressed.",1
"The worse hostpital I rather queen Elizabeth
Poor service
I'm here waiting for 6 yesterday and the docter tooked long to come so remember never come to dis
Hostpital",1
"On Tuesday the 21st October 2014. I fell downstaris from top to bottom, a paramedic attended followed by ambulance back up, both of them were excellant to myself and my husband. On arrival at the hospital a team of drs were waiting for us I had a neck brace on and my bottom were both very painful. From start to finish the staff there were very very good to me, especially a nurse called Emma, she stayed by side as I was very frightened.......I can not complain about the treatment I received there as they were perfect in every way...May I take this opportunity to thank them all for their patience with me and all the help I had from them all.... Again a very grateful Gail Hayes",5
"Very disappointed with the condition of the whole of the original part of building. Wd5, very rundown, not enough nurses or equipment for amount of patients. Looks like all the money is going to the QE hospital.",2
"Just visited the badger clinic (after ringing 111). Superb care from everyone including reception staff,  nurse and Doctor. Even though it’s a Saturday night........ We were seen, assessed, examined, diagnosed and prescribed antibiotics within 25 minutes. 10/10. Thank you.",5
"Stroke ward, 23  senior nurses good. The first acute bay wasn't bad although they needed to be prompted to clean his teeth etc but tried hard to help and were very kind. They moved him later into bay C and it went down hill. They kept him waiting ages for the toilet bottle. Nurse whom was supposed to be watching the ward was instead watching a sleeping patients TV and slow/reluctant to move. Took repeated requests for a bed pan. Shame bay C have let down the hardworking staff in bay A.",1
Horrible experience so far. Waiting for a bed for my son for hours now because they're short of beds on the paediatric ward. had to walk from the children's a&e dept all the way to PAU carrying my son & then they wouldn't answer the buzzer to let us in. 7 rings & 10 minutes later they look at us like i was in the wrong place. i was told in a&e that a bed would be ready but we've been shoved into this tiny little room which is full of people & buggies etc & it so so hot. if there was a fire we'd all be stuck in this box with it's inadequate fire exit. it's shocking how little regard there is for basic humane conditions. vile,1
"Still doing the COVID malarkey. No visitors, wear a mask, only one person allowed in. Expect to wait 4 hours minimum to be seen. Parking an absolute rip off.

This is where our taxes go.",1
They all lazy i had breath issue abd they dont care literally lefted me alone and let me suffer after 4 hours they cane to me literally bad managment if you dont wanna suffer avoid this hospital,1
"My boyfriend is staying on ward 4 and all the nurses, physio's and doctors are brilliant !! Especially Daisy :)
No fault there at all and thankyou to all of them! (If any of them ready this.)

The reason i put 4 stars tho is because the toilets around the hospital are generally really  gross by the end of the day.

Also i didnt like the fact the cafe at the main entrance use plastic cuttlery and take away boxed were used by guests who sat at the table eating anyways !
- maybe wooden disposable or bio degradable cuttlery instead ? And hide the take away boxes unless people ask ?",4
I had a planned c section at heartlands hospital this week I was absolutely over the moon with the way me and my baby girl was treated by all of the staff . It was amazing I cannot fault them at all . After an horrendous experience at good hope  third was brilliant x,5
Shocking after being here for 2 hours they had forgot to put my bloods pressure etc on the system and had fully forgotten about me and then finally after I complained they did them again just for the doctor to come back and say go home and drink water even though I came in with chest pains,1
"Referred to Urology dept by GP in May 2020.  Rang appointment unit on 22nd September, to be advised that ALL GP referrals to the Urology dept during April, May & June have just been sat upon due to 1st wave of COVID. So, massive long waiting list, and unable to give any idea at all (days/weeks/months ?) before I will get an appointment, let alone any treatment for a long standing condition. Shouldn't be an either/or situation. COVID is real, and is here to stay for the long haul. Things need to be managed professionally alongside the pandemic, and not everything else just shoved behind it, as the easy way out. Hugely disappointed by the SYSTEM, and not the NHS individuals.",1
"only go to the hospital if i have too, had to go on Saturday, service was really good,well done A&E staff",5
"Thank you all for the amazing care given to our Mom in both Resus and Ward 22 she was shown care, respect and all the staff in attendance could not have done more to help her and support us, faultless. The NHS should be proud of them.",5
Dirty hospital corridors and toilets with very bad disabled facilities.  The staff ward five did there best with the limited equipment they had . Hdu were great but the money you can see has been spent. Ward ten terrible rude senior staff more worried about their pin than the welfare of the patient . Ward twelve under staffed but over all do well with what they have. Disabled facilities crap shame really drs not bad,1
"I have been to heartlands for many things. Always been treated very well. Staff and doctors are so nice 👍 id like to say a huge thanks to all staff 👌 Anaesthetists  often get forgotton. Doctors and surgeons do a great job. Anaesthetists keep our heart  , blood pressure were it should be, have the authority to say stop ! to a surgeon. They never get a thank you 👎 Id like say thank you to all the Anaesthists  who do a great job 👍 and a thank you to all nusres doctors an surgeons. Heartlands staff are wonderful.",5
Its a really good hospital they take away all your sickness but they do take a really long time like one time I was there for 5 hours but overall good,3
"My Husband spent 5 weeks in Heartlands hospital ICU, HDU and ward 24, he was very ill and was initially diagnosed by Dr Antal Sabo, who took care of his treatment throughout, he is a marvellous Neurologist! and the nicest person you would ever wish to meet. During his stay we met some of the most amazing members of Staff! Heartlands and the NHS were fantastic thank you so much",4
Came in with a on-going issue of chest pain and didn't get seen until 2 hours later. Then they told me everything is fine when quite OBVIOUSLY the pain went down by the time they decided to deal with me and check my blood pressure.,1
"Lack of care on ward 9,  wanted to move cardiology patients to a dirty ward.  When phoning to check on a patient asked why are you calling. Maybe the Matron should stop flirting with the doctors and do her job.",1
"Toilets in A&E are disgusting, wee all over floor. No papers towels to dry hands and toilet paper all over the floor. Toilet seat had hairs on too.
People coughing and spluttering in the waiting room and not even covering their mouths up.
No hand gel in the machines which are around the waiting room.",1
"It should be  called heartless hospital!!!!!
My mom who was 94 good age and still was going strong untill  the 28 january 2019 fell in the house and broke her fema  bone joint to her hip.she got through an hip operation and was doing ok.but the after care on ward 8 was outrageous by the time she can passed she couldn't walk.eat or drink.we was  there every day to help mom to eat and drink .she hadnt showered or had her hair washed for the whole time she was in hospital 2months.Then they told us mom needs to go in nursing home nothing they could do.she rapidly went down hill from lack of care they certainly don't look after the elderly. She was then transfered to ward 17 which was abit better not much . the doctors wasnt staight with us apparently mom had water infection phenomena  and wasnt going in a nursing home she was going in a hospice to die. And thats what happened  she passed away 22nd of march. I am disgusted  with that hospital if thats what you want to call it .It needs caring nurses and caring doctors if there are any ? 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡",1
"I'm still having treatment for extremely rare Hydatid Disease at the Infectious Disease Clinic. Everyone involved, including Royal Orthopedic Hospital have & still are being fantastic. The receptionists, nurses & Consultants always have a smile on their faces & are friendly & welcoming. The most important thing is the great communication between all staff concerned & my appts have always come through very fast, i'm never left 'hanging on & stressing'. I can only say a wonderful department that i'm so pleased i was refered to. A definite 5* from me  :)",5
My Mom took me here every time Inwas attacked at school. They never did anything except make me wait until late at night and only once actually do something. I now have problems with my vision and they have bandaged my fingers for a little fracture I didn't notice but they didn't do anything to my damaged shoulder that had never really heeled and I still feel pain sometimes :(,2
"Thank you Heartlands Hospital for the truly amazing care you gave to my daughter on your Cystic Fibrosis Unit.   Everyone on that Ward was so caring and kind, from the Housekeeping Staff to the Doctors and Nurses.

I came to hospital 7 o’clock but the doctor not seen by 1 am I can see the staff going up and down it’s. Children  A and E        I don’t know what is NHS doing in this country,1
"This hospital has become one of the worst in the country. The (A & E Reception) staff would rather mingle and giggle behind the desk and speak rudely to queues of customers waiting at the window, and then blame funding for poor service and their arrogance. I feel sorry for you if you end up in a&e at this hospital for whatever reason.",1
"I had a baby there last year and it was my first baby . Nightmare experince , firstly the midwife was traine and forgot to let me push on time and the whole process became very complicated! Top on that i was unable to walk and my one hand was unable to do anything and i asked one of the midwife to help me with the baby's nappy changing process as i was badly in pain. I would never ask anyone for help unless i am helpless. Would you beleive the midwife ( senior madam) said to me that your one hand isnt dead . I cried like a hell that day. Since the i am afraid to ask for help and would never like to be in a place like that. Unfortunitly thats the nearest hospital and again i am expecting a baby n dead worried about how i will be treated this time ???!!!",1
What a bloody joke. Why have a appointment system if your going to just see patients whenever you like. 3.00 appointment wasn’t seen till after 5.00 was told the doctor was running late. Who the hell do you over run by 2 hours? completely ridiculous.,1
"One of the worst hospital services iv been to ever, were professionalism isnt anything. Iv been waiting with my daughter who is 8months who cant breath to lung infection from 11am to 12 at midnight an aint been seen been asking an got told i have to wait 48hrs to be seen absolute
Ridiculous",1
"I had an appointment at the Teledermatology Clinic, Medical photography Unit on 29/7/21.
Everyone I had dealings with came across very professionally, & with a caring manner.
A credit to the NHS.👏👏",5
A&E was really good to treat dislocated finger,5
"The last hospital in UK ,the staff don't deserve to work ther ,are rude ,don't  Answer or speak with the people who come ther whit problems ,my opinion if they don't remember whay they decide to work whit people the manager need change all,and in the end you can go ther whit you 4 years old son whit 40 hight fever and put you wait until morning and no doctor come see you .Better if you have o no problems treat you home that to go ther and wait till morning for nathing !",1
"I had to stay here for a few days, i was first on ward 20 then moved to ward 22. I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly as well as very at-tentative. The hospital was very clean and well organized and I would defiantly recommend going there over City Road any-day!",5

avoid if you can my dad was here for 1 week they did all tests and come back he was okay with no issues 1 week later we had to take him to QE within a few days it come back he had a brain tumour...its beyond me how he was in there for 1 week and after everything they didn't pick up on it. its outdated and really needs reviewing.,1
Waiting time is too long also when it comes to A&E they can't be bothered  to check if you in need of emergency care.,1
"Absolutely awful...went there twice, had to wait 3 hours each time for them to tell me i had no illness and they still prescribed me an ear spray and tablets🤔🤔🤔🤔

First time i had really bad ear ache and jaw pain - ''everythings fine, just get these medicines from the boots pharmacy only available from hospital''

Second time today, my head felt like it was gonna explode and i was feeling so dizzy. Earache still there up to this day. Still made me wait for 3 hours and didn't even give me some pain killers in for the time i waited there.  ''everythings fine, just get these medicines from the boots pharmacy only available from hospital''

Wouldn't recommend going there unless you have no option",1

When you visit wards, make sure you have some food and books to read because you may end up waiting for more than 8 hours and after that you may be asked to stay in hospital itself.",3

The nurse said I need a nebuliser as I'm short of breath but he can't give it to me because he can't find one around the hospital. Then he came and threw a blue inhaler at me that fell on the floor and made me pick it up and take 2 puffs out of it as an alternative to a nebuliser. I'm so disgusted!!,1
"Absolutely brilliant, despite being underpaid, understaffed and hugely busy. We must save the NHS from the Tories",5
"Very poorly run hosptal designed to make the sick sicker. My big bugbear here is the car park, never any space, exhorbetant prices. Whilst the hospital has improved recently and I can't fault staff working here I think the way things are managed lets the side down.",2
"Worst hospital, if I could give 0 I would, I have broken my ankle and the doctor set my ankle wrong twice had to be transferred to a different hospital to have surgery on it because he messed up with setting it I am still waiting on my second surgery to have plates put in, I wouldn’t be in this situation if the doctor had set it right and the doctor blamed me and had a go at me for him setting it wrong, never go to this hospital",1

I appreciated your kindness and effort,👏 as you are under pressure and over worked to provide a first class service, makes me feel very humble,
Good luck and good health to all of you,
Thumbs up👍

I recently visted maternity unit for my wife's scan. I must say that state of cleaniness was in very bad shape. Floor was dirty and staff were not very helpful either.,1
"A&E is a waste of space, was referred by NHS Direct for a head injury I had 3 weeks ago and was told by a nasty nurse that NHS Direct don't have a clue what they're talking about and said my obs were ok. Will be reportiing back to NHS Direct, totally useless.

NHS is beyond rubbish",1
The phone lines are disgraceful ..The phone staff couldn't care less..My wife was took away from home unconscious.The ambulance told me to ring after 2 hours...It took me one further hour of holding or being cut off to actually speak to the ward who picked up immediately... You should be ashamed of yourselves.But judging by the way you treat callers i bet you look at your pay and laugh...Money for nothing...Literally you do nothing.,1
"There's never any doctors takes 24 hours to be seen in women's maternity unit left in hot rooms, partners left waiting outside in carparks until they go into labour shocking nhs",1

Many Thanks.

Very good care. However my only problem is a big waste of money in this hospital. There is a pharmacy. But you can't even get prescriptions from it! So what's the point?,4
"Myself and daughter visited A&E
I can’t praise the staff enough for how we were treated while they’re going through this hard time god bless them all",5
"Disgraceful place. Super rude staff. Have been asking about waiting time n being told up to 1 hour. After waiting for 3 hours I found out that  apparently I m still last on the list, taking into account that most ppl who came after me have already being seen. Was sceptical at first point to go there. As I live in West Bham. I won’t recommend to anyone. Better go to Queen Elizabeth.",1
Government wants everyone to go private or want people to get so fed up of waiting times that people would opt for NHS to go private.,1
very rude not helpful at all they didn't help my baby when he couldn't breathe just had us waiting in the waiting room . I will never ever go back. and will be complaining.,1
My son finger bleeding  continues but waiting in emergency more than 6 hours..there is no dr for watching him..not only us too many people very disappointed for heartland hospital service...,1
Apalling AnE. Staff are rude and aggressive in the AnE department. Particularly the AnE nurses. The doctors are fabulous but the nurses need serious people skills. They also have serious RIGHT WING mentality.,1
Friendly staff mostly. Signage could be a little more clear for the imaging suite. Couldn't find it at first. But staff were very polite and patient in giving directions.,5
Came in at 7pm with symptoms of having a stroke it's now 5am in the morning still havent been seen by anyone.,1
"Very professional, kind and caring.",5
"Filthy hospital, needs a good clean and needs to be maintained. Also needs a refurb. Staff are unprofessional and so are reception staff and rude no manners and need customer service studies. I will not have my baby at this hospital.",1
"I'd give this place zero stars if I could.  It should be renamed Heartless Hospital.  I've told my family, if ever I'm taken ill don't let them take me to Heartlands.",1
Loved it my daughter was almost dead and they helped her survive amazing thanks improve the food and the toilets,5
"Thanks very much to Heartlands staff who plastered my mums leg when chipped her foot.  You were friendly, efficient, courteous and thorough.  Everything i could hope for.  Thank you :-)",5
Good hospital. Poor parking. Bad wifi,3
"Parking is a nightmare and expensive, there always 30 min to 40 min delays for a 10 min appointment. On top of that your forced to comd to this hosiptisl when everything can be done at good hope which is our attachment.",1
"Having been notified that my disabled son's been taken to this hospital I phoned to find out what ward etc he was on, having established that he was on ward 20 I was put through, no one spoke it appeared that the call was put on hold and muted, during about the following 3 minutes (of which I was paying for the call) the call was then terminated ""not by me""   I know that hospitals are a bit overworked and short staffed, but had the person who muted and placed the call on hold had taken the time to speak to me they would have found that they would have only been on the phone to me for about 15 seconds,  What is the point of being able to have the call transferred to the ward if no one is going to take the time to answer it,    Such actions don't bode to well when I have waited for 15 hours from the time he was taken to the Hartlands hospital to be assessed as to what his actual condition is,      Sorry Hartlands as hard pressed as it appears you are there is no excuse for such telephone behaviour, therefore this rating has to be a one star.  it would have been a ZERO RATING but the star rating doesn't cover such actions.
The ward where this happened was WARD 20  at approximately 3.10pm on the 31st December 2014",1
"Excellent  support from CMDU during covid 19 - all staff concerned: phone triage, Drs, pharmacy and delivery drivers.
Thank You.",5
"would give no stars.
went in with terrible abdominal pain and after 3 hours of waiting got given buscopan- which is for ibs

After going to a different hospital it turned out i had appendicitis- thanks doc
Found out a simple blood test can confirm that, obviously not worth the doctors time in heartlands",1
"Staff as always are second to none..polite, helpful and with patience above reproach..never had any issues with anything during my continuing 5 months of physio to date..the only problem i have is the price of parking, essentially yet another tax i now have to pay..",4
"Have been to A&E department few times have to say the experience is so bad.  If you have children who need urgent care, please go to another hospitals.",1
Have to regularly have  speech valve  changed after total laryngectomy and all the staff in ENT department are  great 👍,5
Never thought I would ever leave 5* for this hospital but would like to thank everyone from the ambulance to the hospital nurses and the doctors 1 small argument between nurses witch got quite loud in our room but thankfully the doctor was brilliant I'm sorting it out in a very polite respectable mannor towards all involved so really impressed at the hospital and there staff behaviour,5
"Disgusting in here. Place is filthy and its like walking into a foreign country. Hardly anyone speaks english, arguing with staff, never seen anything like it. Need to get out the midlands asap if this is what is has become.",1
"went here for a childrens blood test, waiting times are ridiculous and theres a ticket system. BUT phlebotomists call in people they are familar with whilst everyone else waits! had 3 people before my child but waited 45mins!",1
"My wife recently had lung surgery which involved a Thoracotomy and a Lobectomy. Mr Bishay performed the surgery and I cannot speak highly enough for Mr Bishay and his medical team.
The HDU team also done an excellent job and could not have been any more helpful. Many thanks to everyone.",5
Sat in childrens A&E an i must say worst place on earth the place is a dump floor not cleaned staff rude an ignorant i had to bring my 2 year old son in at 3am an was left on a plastic chair with him asleep in my arm asleep even tho there qas empty cubicles i would rather been seen in the worst part off the world there here again,1
All right but do not let other family members see patients,3
"The staff work very hard and are very caring and kind but you can see they are overworked, as the hospital is too busy! Hundreds of people on a Tuesday afternoon with car parks full.",4
Lying in a wet bed for two hours now nobody seems to be interested so called nurse came to give me anti biotics dropped it on the floo nonr just picked it up and used it when they ask you how much PAIN you are in from 1to ten no matter what the answer they just ealk away and do NOTHING,1
"Hi my experience at heartlands was very positive my partner who had a heart attack was treated through Robert peel, Good Hope, then Heartlands. everyone in this process was totaly profesional, they saved her life what can one say is thank you enough?",5
"What’s is wrong with the people who works here, why they all rude to everyone, big complain and highly to recommend to change all staff and teach them manner and actitudes. I’m SO SORRY FOR WVERY PATIENT AND THEY WAY THEY TRET THEM.",1
"Just been released after a week , treatment , was excellent , food excellent , staff worked as teams at all times on different shifts , you can see they are under pressure , only downside i did find is the time it takes to be discharged , it ran into hours",5
"After negative comments l felt l had to  make a positive  comment... I have in the past week had to take a patient to various departments..
I found from entering to leaving the hospital.. Everywhere spotless...staff were wonderful... Cafe and shop staff exceptionally nice as were the volunteers....
No NEGATIVE comments to make",5
"Calling for hours to find out if my Dad had been taken here, they just didn’t answer the phone.
I had to travel 30 miles just to check something they could have told me on the phone.
Poor poor poor service.",1
Ambulance staff brilliant.but dr  needs more training sent my daughter home only for her to be rushed back in few hours later.and a couple of the nurses were very rude taking the piss out of a patient.not very good service for the job you are in.,1
I have nothing but pure good to say about ward 6 (cardiology)the nurses are amazing just putting up with me is lot ... nurses Brenda sharlene renee & kerry can't thank you guys enough ❤ u all lift my spirits seeing you when I have to stay in ..& Dr pitt my cardiologist is a top man who always makes u laugh even when things feel as bad as it can be ...THANK U HEARTLANDS 4 EVERYTHINK 🙂,5
Not saying that it is the best hospital ever but I would like to thank all of the nurses on ward 7 for looking after my nan when she was on your ward... You were amazing...,3
No longer has a working A&E no Doctors available yet we sat there for 12 hours while my 1 year old was suffering. Took my eldest daughter there and again same thing so just walked out and went to children's hospital.,1
The hospitel is not good sucvice. Staff and medwife is not avelble. I m upset in this here. Very bad. Realy i m unhappy for delivery survice.,1
Had a suspected stroke last Friday 11 and half hour wait in A&E God know's how i am still here! Some staff are ok but alot of them need a kick up the arse  ! Can't put no star's,1
"After being taken to the hospital  via paramedic, I received blood  tests and ecg, followed by a chest xray, to be dumped in a waiting room and a am still waiting there now... I have been in this hospital nearly 18hours now.",1
Been working here for the last 6 ½ years things have changed from Heart of England Foundation Trust to University Hospitals Birmingham Foundation Trust.,5
"Hospital itself is ok, the parking is outrageous they say u get 30min free but by the time u find a place to park ur paying for it, they definitely need to make the car park alot bigger",3
"My mother who is terminally ill, waited in a&e for 1w hours, cring woth pain and unabke to sot. These couldn3 provide bed.
We pay every tax, you can name in this country.
Is this how we public get treated?
SHAME ON YOU,!!!!!!!!
WHAT MAKE YOU GREAT BRITIAN?",1
Went to the optometry department. The lady was really kind but I had to wait 1.5 hours for my appointment which wss already booked.,4
"Im disappointed in my last appointment 09/01/19 ,9:25 clinic 1.very clever doctor said:hospital wil not to able to spend £ 1000 for your funny finger. Do it yourself. Go to somewhere . By by . Thank you for big help.mariusz ps waste time, and off work",1
"I had a big health problem Saturday night in the early hours I went to A & E at heartlands ,desperate ....... after being looked over  assessed and treated very well by overworked staff , with a heavy patient load , and mix of people, some nice some with bad attitudes and manner , remained professional, I was admitted to bay 8 , and was also impressed with the staff on this ward , down from the consultant to the doctors to the nursing staff to the auxiliaries ,and again they all did their best for me in a caring professional manner ,and it certainly paid off , as things came good for me ,i have not been to a hospital for many years, and read and hear what people say , the only thing I have to say is,.... thank you all very much for you kindness ,I live to fight another day, well quite a few I hope, I am proud to know people like you all , and thank you is not enough to say, I am impressed , and don't know how you all do it , and remain dedicated and happy . from a very grateful man , god bless you all.",5
"Thanks to the fact nobody answers the phone there, i didnt get to say goodbye, to one of the best friends,  a man could have. I know times are hard for everybody, but i find it ridiculous, that in 2020, a phone call cant be completed. Over an hour and no answer. Ridiculous!",1
"Not good services at all. If you are going there for an emergency you must wait very long time anf doesn t treat you. If you need to do a scan you need to wait days, dedn t matter you are suffering.",1
"Excellent Covid care for myself  & husband, from tea lady all the way up to consultant & everyone in between. Everyone went the extra mile, cannot praise or thank them enough.",5
"I had an OGD Gastroscopy here, although the wait was a little longer than I wished for, the treatment that I received, the friendliness and professionalism of the team was brilliant, five stars.",5
We had a baby in this hospital the first two days the staff was amazing after two days on the other section everything’s change the nurses midwifes it’s been a really bad experience,1
Went to Heartlands on a divert from Hood Hope for my wife's labour. She didn't give birth there but the support and service they gave during a check up was great.,5
Extremely efficient. Appointments on time. Pleasant staff. Car parking extortionate. £3.10 for 45 mins.,5
The staff here are very caring they try their very best considering the stress the NHS is under. Me and my family never have any problems here.,5
"Such a bad experience been waiting here for 10 hours to get results and to speak to doctors.
Extremely rude staff",1
The doctors and nurses  are very careing  and kept us  informed  about everything to do with your loved one they do a brilliant  job and definitely  should get better pay for doing what they do.,5
"Your kid needs to die so they can check him, they are a priority after the doctors finishes their jokes, staying on their phones and they say they can wait some more after 4-5hours.",1
I went there for the first time today it was clean and tidy and I was seen straight away. Excellent staff who were friendly and approachable there are far worse hospitals out there.,5
Didn't get the help I was led 2 believe I would so very disappointed got nothing good 2 say regarding this facility,1
Absolutely appalling! We waited a whole 5 hours to just receive the news that we were fine. It’s disgusting how long they keep their patients waiting.,1
My husband was in ward 23 and 20 and couldn't of asked for better treatment the nurses were wonderful .thank you all,5
Really poor service and staff dont really care and wait over 9 hours with no medical attention. Would recommend to University of Coventry hospital.,1
"Came to hospital with server pain, the pain is so unbearable that non of the medication that was prescribed previously worked to assist with pain relief , I requested if I can have something to help with the pain and the answer was yes,

Waited now for over two hours and still not been given any pain relif

Might aswell stay at home an",1
This hospital is revolting the nurses on ward 4 including the H.C.A and sister Sarah are darn right rude they do not feed the patient adiquat food to the point patients are losing weight they judge and laugh about the patients behind there backs which is very unprofessional most of the nurses smell of smoke and it's a lung ward the jugs they hand out are disgusting how ever there are the odd nurses who are very good KT and Leanne and flo are very good at what they do the matron Alison is ok but I was told by another matron and a surgeon to contact PALS as even they were discusted in the care the patients have been receiving would I recommend this hospital no would I heck would I recommend the surgeons hell yes I would would I recommend ward 4 nope I'd run a bloody mile,1
"At Heartlands , all social distancing & disinfecting was all being done, but as it was the only place I had been , I had covid19 symptoms a week afterwards, & was tested. I strongly believe I picked it up in hospital, but not 100% 🤔",3
Will get there eventually(take that as I mean it),4
Extremely bad hospital. I dont blame the staff or doctors. I blame the facilities in that hospital. Very poor resources available for doctors. My partner was scheduled to have an operation there and we went twice and waited all day to be sent to the  theatre but due to limited resources we came back disappointed,1
"I’m in ward 9 bay5 all of nurse very nice spical Tina, Carla, and Sophie,ana these nurses very very nice.. she look after me all the time but one doctor in ward no 9 bay5 he is too much rude with me yesterday 17/4/19 him name mr nawghare .. he fight with me as well.. he is not good person and doctor as well.. mr nawghare not good doctor in heartland hospital.. but nurses all of them very nice.. heartland hospital best hospital in the world.... thanks nurses Tina , Carla, Sophie and ana..",5
"Very very very clean, helpful and kind nurses,they will  always have a laugh with you, and very big and amazing facilities, like for example: the shops and faith room, whoever says this is a bad hospital ,😠😠😠, but car parking is humongous,  but also quite high in prices, but overall  5 stars, maybe 6",5
"my mother sent home with a broken pelvis that they didnt find and fall again because couldn't walk and broke her nose too, QE find it within half a hour ,",1
Leaving an elderly man with heart conditions making him wait for over 15hours cant find no one to help this hospital needs to shut down asap,1
i was transffered to this hosp from the manor i was really ill i received great care they couldnt do enough for me it was so clean nothing was too much for the nurses i was on ward 20 then moved to ward 28 and i was discharged feeling great with all the drugs they gave me through the iv drips i was discharged with more medication to continue for a few days must say ive never felt this well in a long time the staff in the a and e was great to me too ty,5
I wanted to thank heartlands hospital as they organised a care plan for my gran as she was unwell and strugling.my gran was 96 and was nearly blind aswell.that care plan helped her live out her last few months with pride and care and at her own home with dignity.she was moved to a hospice last few weeks.that made her last months happier and independant.she found hospitals to stressfull at her age and i think heartlands understood that aswell.i understand that doctors and nurses are under alot of pressure aswell.and it took alot of carers to care for my gran different times etc.i do understand its alot of pressure on hospitals aswell.i know everyone has different experiences.but i did feel they tried there best for my gran.,3
Spend 5 days in here staff were terrible and speak to you like your 5 not an adult ans I also witnessed a nurse physically grab an older patient and drag him over in the bed even though he said he was comfortable where hen was impossible to get any sleep due to nurses constantly banging in to things around your bed and having to beg for painkillers already prescribed to me that bad I got up and walked out,1
"Place is awful!! Doctors are useless!! Rude staff! Poorly run hospital ! Disgusting! If you think to die, it's the best place! Dirty place, filthy floors, bad!!",1
"Some staff are great, alot let the place down. Not the best at communication, very stuck in their ways, not moving people correctly with slide sheets. Not a good place at times.",2
"Anticoagulation, nursing staff and Dr's are generally good, however  phoning to request medication seems none existant.",1
Navigation inside and out is challenging,4
"Great staff, very stretched but great nevertheless... Very tired hospital building though",5
"So my husband went in for emergency at 10:30 pm and left at 6 in the morning without being seen

The waiting time is ridiculous
You see a lot of people just giving up and goi g home
The NHS needs help",2
Care staff excellent but criminally poor medical care. Arrogant consultants and doctors meant a completely unnecessarily agonising death.,1
"Very very bad in willow suite experience, they dont even have a docotor there, I would never ever recommend any one to go there if you have a choice. They dont even care the child after birth and my babys temperature went down. they are really really BAD. PLEASE DONT GO WILLOW SUITE.",2
Staff at A E major  3 at heartland hospital  are brilliant  clean environment  wait was a bit long but I don't have a lot of patience  anyway,4
my experience at this hospital was OK. they treated me well for my toe fracture but the waiting time is way too much. the systems don't update the details quickly.,4
really friendly staff and due to my son is a premierture they sensed my wife home and staff always looking after my son really friendly and have loads of space with 4 baby’s it is not noisy thank you,5
"Worse Emergency which I ever been, in 1.5 houre 4 doctors served 3 patient. After 5.5 houre I just go home.",1
It is having a major refit for parking and new buildings so it has made things awkward and confusing. People dont seem to understand the one way system parking,3
didn’t even try to help us,1
"A&E always packed, waiting hours in end to see a doctor.",2
I did not go here as a patient. Just went to the restaurant area. Loved it.,5
"I am admitted in hospital last 3 days I have very bad experience in this hospital
especially nursing staff .today 17/10/2022 Monday",1
"Absolutely appalling service from ENT heartlands! Cannot say a kind word or actually give any advice without making something seem bigger than it actually is, NHS England really need to sort it out",1
Quite good hospital with big car park. Phoning there is a big problem as you could spend good few hours before someone will answer it.,2
Nothing happens weekends but otherwise busy staff always sort you out eventually. IMO kitchen is awful. Occasionally something decent comes out but rare.,4
Endoscopy team. Made me relaxed. Very professional. Organised and deserve to be praised. Well done team. Happy christmas.,5
"These nurses do a thankless job, abused by druggies, drunks and every one thinks they are  the only ones in hospital, and should have one to one care, AE is for exactly what it means accident and emergency, not for the local drunk who has too many drinks and takes up an ambulance then a bed for days, then they get put through detox programme, same as the local druggie days in hospital, abusing staff swearing shouting, so the five stars are for the nurses and health care professionals.",5
"It was a quick vist, not much waiting for x-ray department. Good service",4
Absolute garbage. Waited for more than 8 hours and was told I'd have to wait another 4 hours. Not worth going to especially if it's something really urgent. Terrible waiting system. Don't waste your time go somewhere else,1
"Worlds shittest hospital ever.
Do not come to this hospital unless you don’t want to be treated and have your time waisted. As staff over here seem to think they get paid to chat and do nothing all day everyday.
Rubbish service",1
Shocking very poor service due to lack of care compassion in A&E. Not assessed for pain when asked for pain relief I was told to be patient when I was in agony.,1
Great staff.  Very big and confusing when finding departments so well worth asking reception for directions. Can get very busy with parking spaces difficult to find and quite expensive.,4
What's the point in saying I will get referred to ENT when they don't even refer me. LIARS. USELESS hospital. On going ear infection and can't even get it sorted. Beyond fuming.,1
Dad been here. Ward 8 he has recieved excellent care n attention. Thank you kind nurses and doctors.,5
"Well laid out but a hell of a walk from entrance to day case unit, not good if you have a problem with mobility and no wheelchairs available",4
Of you don’t want to die in the waiting room avoid this hospital like the plague!!!!!,1
"Excellent service, doctors, nurses and staff were very professional and polite, even with all the added pressure of Covid",5
Awful arrived at childrens A&E only 2 patients in front had x-ray then we sat and waited over 3 hours to be seen by a doctor how on earth would they cope if it was busy shocking,1
"was admitted by ambulance at 03.00hrs was not seen by a dr, 5.30 hrs later,a Dr turned up to find out what was wrong with me its a good job I was not having a heart attack, disgusting service.",2
"The doctors did an MRI scan which helped my diagnosis and treatment options, thanks for going the extra mile...",5
"Excellent service , lacking cleainess actually witness a cleaner not adhere to health n saftey while poorly attempting to clean uids of a floor (she only  used the nsp4py pad that was put there  by a doctor) no cleaning just picked  it up .",3
Can somebody explain why the hospital would send out an envelope with an empty container to an 82 year woman without any information as to why she has received it and what to do with it?,1
"Sprained my ankle last week, i had to ask for crutches and i was not given any support or bracket for my foot
The name should be changed to hopeless",1
"COMING IN AT 10PM ONLY TO HEAR A 4 HOUR WAIT. 4 HOURS LATER NO DOCTORS ANYWHERE, NO STAFF ANYWHERE. BUT WHOLE PLACE IS FULL. THEN GET TOLD ANOTHER 4 HOUR WAIT. YOU THINK 8 HOURS IS LONG ENOUGH? CLEARLY NOT FOR THESE LEGENDS.",1
Doctor who saw me. Was nice and kind. But there receptionist was very rude.,5
Excellent staff clean respectful service from all at TELEDERMATOLOGY easy to feel more than cared for thank you to all concerned,5
"Had to take my mother in for some X-Rays to be taken. The place is filthy, equipment had dust all over it and cobwebs in the corners of the room, how anyone work in such mess is beyond me!",2
Poor service i was in so much pain taken in by ambulance got seen by a nurse within 20 mins she asked a few questions and tells me to wait in the waiting room 3 hours no body came to see me i was crying in pain and the end i just come home,1
"LONG TIME WAITING!!!
Doctors don't seem to care about patients, they send you home even if your still in pain, dirty place, rude staff!!!!!",1
"Best hospital fantastic I do operation I Bon a little girl
All the doctors and nurses and midwives very very good thank you so much 😢I miss you all and I miss the hospital 🏥 😢😭thank you so much",5
I came in children ANE today the receptionist was very very rude misbehaved totally unprofessional.  Need training how to talk with people.,1
"I had a 7 hour wait to be seen, rude, unprofessional nurses,",1
Nursing staff amazing doctors and x ray very poor service wouldn't ever go back and would never recommend this hospital to any one,2
"My dad has been in for 5 days and they have done nothing to help him get better, he should have been transferred to a hospital near us as soon as he went in",1
Horrible Staff that don't respect you and let you strive in pain and wont do anything it's better going Q.E. hospital.,2
What an incredible hospital thank you so much to the amazing staff who cared so well for my brother we are incredibly grateful for their care and dedication to their profession,5
Referred by Good Hope.  Excellent work removing a foreign object from my ear canal that was both quick and painless.,5
"I had a great natural birth, thank you all for the wonderful care🥰🥰🥰♥️",5

"I have breathing problems and when I'm breathing my lungs are paining I went after work to hospital because my chest pain was getting worse I was waiting nearly 6 hours from 7 pm till 1 am night without giving chance to see doctor who could at least advice something but No...
So I just gave up and left hospital after 6 hours waiting very disappointed and stressed.",1
Don't rush to get onto ward 6 some nurses honestly  not care you can buzz for help and they show up 10-15mins later after their chat of boyfriends makeup or what pub their off too,1
The worse hospital I encountered in my life...3rd world world hospital is more decent that that..No rules staff at reception are rude.,1
I appreciate the staff are busy but so far we have been here for 7 hours . Aunt has a broken hip and still is waiting for pain  relief really is not acceptable -,1

At least a two hour wait before seeing a doctor and that was an appointed time..,5
"Really considerate of new patients, I was realy nervous but despite the stress the doctors and nurses care was very comforting. Thank you xx",4

"No waiting, friendly staff, good restaurant",5
"So kind and thoughtful. Had time for my mother, despite being really busy.",5
Mediocre facilities and seemingly very dirty corridors and toilets. Not of the same standard we have saw elsewhere with other hospitals in the city,3
"Come to visit my daughter, with me on crutches, and I find no wheelchairs available. Calls itself a hospital!.",4
The staff are absolutely wonderful. Treatment faultless. Cannot thank the staff enough.,5

"It seems there are very mixed reviews about this hospital. However, I spent several days here from the moment a loved one was admitted to HDU7 until she took her final breath yesterday when the life support machine was switched off. I could not have met a kinder, respectful and caring team of doctors and nurses there than anywhere else.

The Nurse in Charge on Ward 3 and some of the team I met there too (another person I knew hospitalised there) were also the sweetest and most polite people who appear to to be in their professions for the right reasons.

Admittedly, I baulked at the shabbiness of the hospital - so old, dated and depressing BUT that pales into insignificance when comparing it to the compassionate staff.

I am from London and it seems money is being poured into hospitals there to make them look top notch and fancy - aesthetically pleasing one might say but NOTHING compares to the dignity shown to family, friends and those who are patients at Heartlands.

I know the outcome was not what was expected nor wanted and we have to come to terms with it but I thank all those whom I came into contact with who went above and beyond truly caring for our darling loved one and ourselves. You are the epitome of what a caring profession is meant to look like. Thank you all 💕",5
"I have had many bad experiences here but none worse than today, when a receptionist refused to allow be to be seen for care as she disagreed with my GP referral letter. The staff working here don’t care about your health or wellbeing one bit, they simply turn up to be paid for minimal effort. The worst example of what is an absolutely terrible “health” service.",1
I'm waiting to see a neurologist I have refused to go to heartless even though I live a few bus stops away told my gp torefer Mr tothe city hospital,1
No respect for these kids waiting for hours siting on uncomfortable plastic chairs for hours.,1
"Hospital has no system every body does what he wants, no body cares or help patients no updates Complaint useless I paid $3500 for nothing. God is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs for you. If it was useful, I would have put a negative star.",1
"Not a good experience, a bad 6 weeks for me. I had my right leg amputated - this alone is painful and there was no psychological support. But the treatment by some of the sisters was a disaster. Once a bandage change took 4 hours and was only done straight away because my husband intervened!
In Ward 9 there were 3 very nice, nice nurses, such as Nadine, but the rest were malicious or racist, I can't really say.
If I had problems with the staff, they wanted to give me painkillers or a psychiatrist, which I decided not to do.
The healthcare system is completely different than in Germany and you almost have to kiss the staff's feet when they come 45-60 minutes after ringing the bell and ask what you want...
Physiotherapy is limited to sheets with pictures of how to do which exercises
I was given a defective wheelchair and I had to sign for the “entirety” of it, otherwise I wouldn’t have gotten anything. Therapy then consisted of seeing whether I could wash myself and make it onto the wheelchair on my own.
We were promised an electric bed for our home... later that wasn't true and my husband had to buy a normal bed.
Added to this was my problem of not understanding English very well.
Most of the doctors were nice, but visits only lasted a few seconds and they didn't really want to know how I was doing.
All in all: losing my leg was the worst experience of my life!",1
Pretty helpful,4
"Today I went to children’s A&E with my 6 month old. Staff were very thorough and empathetic.

We were seen in good time and observations were taken regularly.

My local hospital is Newham but I drove here instead as I find the care so much better.",5
"Royal London Hospital and medical college. The biggest medical college hospital in Europe and the best clean hospital in the country. Facility with emergency heliport on the top.
All the Dr, nurse and medical students are great and serve the entire country.
When you are inside you won't feel typical hospital or smell. The restaurant open isde almost all night.
We proud to be part of the community and happy we managed to do something for them during the lock down.",5
Unfortunately I live in East London and every time I need an ambulance for serious ailments I’m taken here. It’s a modern hospital or so it was. It’s extremely dirty. Weekend the toilets hardly get cleaned at all maybe this once a day. Nothing yet on Sunday. The hospital A&E is like being in the dungeon you can’t get phone connection. No food or water. Telling me I should drink lots but there is non to be had. The staff just seem to be walking around from 1 point to another or fixed to a monitor and if you dare to disturb them. Here since 5 am and it’s 11.30. Still waiting for a cup of tea. I was told I could order Just eat which is fine but you can go to the reception and collected. I wouldn’t mind but they have all my ailments and disabilities so you would think they wouldn’t suggest the walk. I asked and begged the ambulance guys to take me somewhere else but “we have tried take you to the nearest one” Jo point putting a review as no one is in charge there!,1
Avoid at all cost! My dad went in with grade 2/3 bed sore he got from Homerton hospital. The doctor told the nurses they need to turn him every few hours… this NEVER happened. We would find him lying in his own urine and also soaked from the drip coming out if his arm and NO ONE checking for hours. He was there for 2 weeks and his bed sore escalated to a life changing STAGE 4. All because of negligence from the staff. We would hear them talking and laughing with each other and when asked if someone was going to change the soaked sheets they would say some will come..  5 hours we were still waiting. They have denied negligence and claimed it was just a complaining customer….. They are an insult to people whom contribute to their wages. What a waste of tax payers money. Hospital night STAFF are the worst….,1
"I was fortunate enough to experience twenty eight days of selfless care and love from multiple heroes within the NHS at The Royal London Hospital.
A massive shout out to Ward 10F who looked after me in this wonderful institute.

Those who complain please seek and pay for private medical care, that way you can complain all you want.
How ungrateful of you, you're a shame to yourselves and should not stretch our NHS system more than it already is.",5
"Partner spent 22hrs on a chair in A&E with perferated bowels. No beds . Nurses are stretch, they helped with pain relief CT scans etc . No beds so had to wait in pain for next bed n a hard chair . I don’t blame the nurses , they do their best, nontrolley bed free either .
Where does the millions of £ to NHS go. Certainly not to A&E and to free up beds.
By the time he go a bed he was severely sick. Hope the rest of treatment improves.
Thanks to nurses … Doctors… well very elusive .. haven’t seen one yet .",1
This hospital is amazing! We had our baby there and from my very first appointments I realised how kind and caring nurses and doctors are in this hospital! I was afraid of pretty much everything related to birth - but thanks to everyone working there my experience was very positive. Highly recommend!,5
"big hospital with almost all facilities, helping and nice staff. expensive parking, better come by train. if you need to go for blood test, book before to avoid waiting time, pharmacy need to be improved, sometimes more than two hours waiting specially in evening time.",4
"My experience at Royal London Hospital:

* Ambulance home attendance paramedics are kind and helpful. Some paramedics get to you quickly, other times there is a bit of waiting time.
* Hospital receptionists show no interest in your situation and couldn’t care less whether you need urgent help or not.
* Some nurses have no clue what departments to send you too.
* The waiting time is ridiculous most of the time between 5-7 hours. They don’t prioritise serious medical conditions over non serious.
* Some new starter nurses have no clue how to perform basic tasks etc putting needles in to draw blood leaving bruises and jabbing the needle multiple times looking for a vein.
* Some staffs at the hospital are kind and helpful others have bad attitudes and make you feel unwelcome.
* Some nurses whom handle babies are gentle others are really rough and aggressive.
* Some staffs talk to each other when you’re close by saying indirect inappropriate comments about you to make you feel uncomfortable.
* The hospital has many facilities etc bathrooms, parking, baby feeding rooms.",3
"We visited A&E with our six week old baby. We were seen quickly and were so impressed and grateful for the nurses and doctors who saw us (especially Andy). Everyone was so professional, kind and helpful.",5
"Staff Nurse was extremely rude from start to finish. She got my name wrong and did not bother to check whether she had the  right patient. She did not explain what she would be doing and did not provide any instructions when carrying out the tests and expected me to know what to do and that was just the tip of the iceberg. She was visibly inconvenienced. My mistake, for turning up at a hospital unwell. Avoid if you can.",1
"My elderly mum was rushed to royal London by ambulance  with severe breathing problems 9 days ago  had to wait 31 hrs in A&E for a bed on a ward. No drinks no food as I left my purse & phone at home.

Finally got a bed on the 13th floor most of the staff were helpful caring my mums blood were mixed up, then kitchen staff went on strike so NO HOT MEALS AT ALL. some staff very rude, laughing loud not responding to patients emergency buzzers. I mean what the hell is going on here !!!!!!",1
"Horrible hospital will score it even lower if possible.
My sister went to the A&E with pins/ needles and numbness on her right arm.
The waiting was very long, and the doctor’s diagnosis was a joke. He said that my sister was just stressed with her GCSE exams.
Months later we found out that actually, she sufferes from Multiple Sclerosis.
The doctors at this hospital are clearly misdiagnosing patients and putting them at great danger.",1
"My disabled mum was in London from Wales and really needed your help in the middle of the night - she was in horrific pain, couldn't stand, walk, use her hands or feet. Not deemed a medical emergency so no ambulance for her, so my brother miraculously carried her to a taxi and brought her to you. She was made to sit in her nighty in pain, cold and shivering (wouldn't give her a blanket) and told a minimum 6hr wait. I drove all the way from Wales and back in that time to get her, and get medical help at home. Shame on you.",1
"My experiences have been very positive here, especially the nurses. The doctors sometimes seem in too much of a hurry to explain things properly but overall the treatment and care is very good. Good facilities in the hospital too.

They are exctional with young children.",5
"I came with my 3 week new born baby girl reason was she vomited and difficult to breathing on that's time I called ambulance they told its will take 1 hour then i didn't wait I called my friend and came with him, they put us reciption after that's 1 of the  nurus checked  her and told us she OK now her breathing  and pallus OK and doctor will see shortly but we are waiting it's been 2.40 minutes still didn't see us with the new born could be happen anything but are not taking care of because of doctor only of them working in the hospital night shift in a baby A&e.
How slow there service.",1
"Talk is cheap....too much gossip, not enough action. You would get fired in a law firm for this. Had to wait 7 hours in my bed for anyone to talk to me. Doctor for endoscopy showed up 1 hour late with no apology. Staff criticising each other as to who was more lazy. No slippers on exit so in my weakened state had to fight through the Whitechapel markets to get them (in my hospital socks and then back via underground on the Elizabeth Line (which, unusually, was working).",1
"I have come to accompany a colleague from work who was not feeling well. We both work in aviation and I came straight from work in my uniform. The lady at the front desk didn’t speak any English (understandable) but was very rude. After my colleague went inside to be consulted she basically kicked me out of the waiting room without any reason and with (again) a rude tone… I was just sitting on a chair and reading news on my phone, didn’t make a sound to disturb anyone… Never felt more humiliated before being kicked out of a public institution without reason…",1
"We’ve been told to wait up to 5 hours in emergency room. Arrived 23:30 and still here now at 7 am with suspicious of concussions!!!
I came here with my husband and I feel like I’m gonna die from cold in the moment, I swear to god, those aren’t conditions for human beings. Bunch of energetic people laughing and going before us all those hours, doesn’t seem like a bigger priority to me than concussions and possibly brain damage!!!! Sickness.",1
I am waiting with my 41 weeks pregnant wife in ward more then 48 hours to take in labour room..  because of there have no midwife… and no clear information about when they will take her.,1
"Diabolical experience here. It took me over 10 hours to be attended to for a simple GP consultation at the urgent treatment center and get results from a CT scan. There is no urgency, and the hospital is poorly staffed.

What the hell are we spending taxes on. Despicable.",1
"On 9th December I took my sister in law to the hospital due to 37 week pregnancy and she have labour pain but the royal London hospital staff are very rude with my wife as well my sister in law who is patient.the midwife also so rude, they Anger on the patient like this is not acceptable 😔, the patient in too much pain on labour so how can she control his body but they didn't try to understand patient situation 😭.
Again I want to say that please prefer NewHam hospital instead of royal London hospital, I have great experience with the newham hospital.
The royal London hospital staff really mad and nonsense.",1
"Spent around 5 days in hospital due to kidney issues. Staff and nurses were amazing, the hospital in general was clean and the food was of good standard.

A&E wait times can be quite long though. I waited around 10 hours to be seen.",4
"Terrible experiences, we had several visit to the children’s A&E during the last year, also I give birth there. in general NHS could have been more efficient, average waiting hour for our A&E was way too long, one time was over 4 hours. The midwives were lack of knowledge the overdosed me with the medication that went with epidural, which caused 2.6L blood loss afterward. and was too busy answering requests after the labour",1
"Today I had an appointment with anesthetic consultant called Tim.

He is marvelous, he is best i ever seen anyone in NHS. He is real professional gentleman.

First of all, he welcomed me and had a short chat about my commute.

Then he explained in detail why i have been called in today. Clearly he had extensive knowledge about my medical history. Clearly he read my medical history notes to understand my position for this coming up operation. He didn't show any urgency just to fill in the blanks, he gave me time to ask any question relating to anesthetic.

I am really very happy satisfied about the procedure coming up soon and a very best human behaviour he showed to me today.

Wish you best of luck in future Tim. Thank you very much for today's brief regarding my operation coming soon.

Bless you.

Regards
S Rashid",5
"My frnd got epilepsy.. we went in , they admitted him day before yesterday. By that time 2-3 times he got seizure and dislocated his shoulder 2 times. They treated him some how. And they discharged him after one day , but they didn't even inform the emergency contact before discharging, they just discharged him normally. They just made him walk away as of nothing happened like kind of normal fever. What a great irresponsible bunch of educated people. Actually no use doesn't have common sense or humanity.",1
"Attended the hospital today with my mother and I must say that Harley (Dental Nurse) and Lisa (Dental Doctor) both had great bedside manners and worked collaboratively firing my mothers assesment. The clinical space is clean and so is the reception area. We were called in on time and allowed me to wait with my Mum because she was nervous. Harley gave me a mask to make me feel more comfortable and reduce the chance of any cross contamination. The care recieved today was second to none and my mother felt very well cared for, both Harley and Lisa are a credit to the NHS. Thank you.",5
"This A&E department is the worst I've ever seen in the world. My partner is a stage four cancer patient and was admitted to the A&E because of severe symptoms, such as terrible pain which meant he needed to be given strong morphine every two hours. The staff at the A&E treated us with contempt. My partner slept on a trolley overnight and was kept waiting for the whole day to be transferred to a ward where he could sleep in a bed. Every time he needed morphine and used the alarm button to get attention from the staff, he was ignored for up to an hour each time. They were looking at their screens, ignoring him. When I finally lost my patience and asked about the bed that we were waiting for the whole day, one of the staff told me to stop talking or she will call security! Within two minutes of my complaint, they gave Dave a bed on the 11th floor. Why couldn't they do it before? Why such lack of respect for a cancer patient who is in terrible pain? Something needs to be done about the conduct of these staff members.",1
Very very bad I lost my husband due to his life saving operation that needed to be done .but kept getting delayed only when he became very Ill they tried to do opp. Way to late he was 56 years old got 3 children all under the age of 16 appsurlutly devastated and heartbroken.,1
"Awful. i was calling the triage regarding a pregnant patient who didn’t speak english.
she went to the hospital with labour pain 2cm dilated, they sent her back saying they won’t keep anyone under 4cm dilated.
so she was in pain throughout, went home & was dilated enough that an ex midwife in that patients house said i think i can see the baby’s head. you should go hospital.

i called the triage to ask what was the safest thing to do at that point. untill the ambulance arrives, incase baby comes out. so i can help her.
the person picked up the phone i explained the situation she said to me “if the baby head is out why are u calling us, call the ambulance in a very rude tone  & she put the phone down on me. 😤😤😤 ridiculous.",1
Absolutely disgusted with the care they have given my dad. My dad was brought in on Wednesday 4th october after having surgery done on his hip at a different hospital he is still in there now 6pm Wednesday night was his last food drink and medication untill Thursday afternoon he had to beg for a cup of coffee cause of how dry his mouth was he's now even been asked to take his own medication cause no one is coming round he is diabetic he was told he needs to go for a scan Thursday so waited and waited to then be told today (Saturday) that he no longer having one once being checked over he can be discharged which again when is that going to happen hasnt even been told what ward he is on my dad has been left clueless and without food and drinks for hours the way he has been treated is disgusting its like he has just been left to defend him self this use to be a really good hospital but now going down hill !!!!!!!,1
I went in on Monday 11th September with light contractions they told me that I’m in slow labour and to go home. On Tuesday 12th September at 1:45am my waters broke so I went back up to the hospital with really bad contractions they then sent me home again and gave me paracetamol and Co-Codamol to help with the pain then 11am in the morning I went back up there with 10/10 pain they finally kept me in. They left me in the triage room for 6hrs without gas &air then finally they gave me gas&air after asking multiple times then they took me down to the delivery suite. I had a really bad labour I would not recommend having a baby in this hospital.,1
Had our 3rd baby here via C-section. We were looked after incredibly well on 8F - thank you!!,5
"The worst hospital in the word, where the time as an emergency is about 4/5hours,unprofessional.
NHS is getting worst and worst in every single day. Old womans and man they are waiting extremly hours.
This hospital is only for quantity not for quality.",1
"I’ve been twice to the A&E’s of this hospital in April, as I had terrible pain in the left of my chest, high fever, struggle to breath…
The first doctor gave me paracetamol, the second doctor gave me paracetamol and vitamin C (he pretended to be a senior doctor though) after I begged him to help me.

No X-ray, no in-depth examination, …

I flew back to France in a terrible condition, where I’ve immediately been sent to emergency service and had a lung surgery the day after.

I’m a 27yo, non smoker, with a good lifestyle, that was about to die because of the incompetency of their doctors.

A complete shame.",1
"Cancelled an Ultrasound appointment with 4 hours notice. Booked another appointment on a Friday at 6pm, received letter confirming date and time and, when I showed up, it turned out Ultrasound closed at 4pm. Fix your system issues…",1
"I would not even rate the postnatal care with 1 star but I have no choice. Staff would enter my room without permission despite the curtains being drawn. One staff member, her name was Fatima, entered my room whilst I was in the bathroom, my baby was sleeping and I had only just got a chance to use the bathroom. I heard someone enter the room and then my baby started crying. I ran out to see what had happened and Fatima was already walking out. I questioned her later on why she entered. At first she told me she had come to check baby's blood pressure but later she changed her reasoning and told me it was her job at the time to check on all babys to ensure their faces are not being covered from any blankets. Why did she change her statement? I still have doubts on what happened but after that I felt afraid to even go to the bathroom. Another midwife insisted on showing me how to give baby liquid medication. Despite me insisting on doing it myself she wanted to show me. She pressed the syringe and poured a lot of liquid rather than do it slowly, my baby was spluttering, coughing and crying but the midwife carried on despite me telling her to stop. She was telling my baby to hurry up as she didn't have all day. I told her that she is causing my newborn distress and she later got very rude to me. During my time of discharge, that same midwife took a long time with my discharge papers and handing my medication. I had repeatedly gone to the front desk asking her how much longer it would take. She kept telling me she is waiting for the pharmists to prescribe the medication. I waited 5 hours for some saline water I could have made myself. When I went to ask her for the last time, she picked up the medication that was in front of her and rudely said come on then. Now this is what shocked me, the medication and discharge papers were in front of her for a very long time as I had seen it there for a while but was not aware it was for me. She was too busy chatting to her colleagues. I could mention so many other incidences during my postnatal care in ward 8B but I will end up writing a dissertation. Overall, most staff were very rude including receptionists and midwifes. Sonographers and doctors were nice but that's all.",1
"they are incompetent! I spent 4 hours with a fractured hand, so that I could get to the doctor and be sent home to take paracetamol. Of course, 9 months have passed and now my mouth is suffering!",1
"Huge place, been several times as relative in there, lifts took a bit of getting used to but fine with them now, however 'always' see people totally confused by the lifts. Lift system very badly designed.
Always a problem to find parking. Far to few spaces for disabled! Authorities when will you understand people go to hospitals because they have too, not want too, therefore cater for better parking, I mean there's land shuttered off deserted on the grounds why can't this be used as is for people visiting or patients attending as well as disabled.  Get off your high horses and pushing poor people further into the ground!",3
"I want to know why people are coming Emergency! Because we need at Emergency but Hospital teach us non Emergency, I. Coming today with my chaild but they said they don’t have doctors only 2 Nurses ! Waiting time 5/6 Hours! My Question is if anything happened who is Responsible for that!",1
For years of being fobbed off by other health professionals in my local and surrounding areas I was eventually referred to this hospital ENT department which they gave a thorough examination and could do surgery to solve the problem I was given my date which went ahead on that date and received the most professional treatment I could have only imagined the nurses made sure my aftercare was dealt with swiftly and received the very best of care and attention right up until I went home the surgery went well and the surgeon and his team made me feel so much at ease I thoroughly recommend this hospital,5
Avoid if at all possible! I waited almost 5 hours in the urgent treatment centre. I kept being told they'd call me soon. Then once I saw a nurse I had to wait an additional 1.5 hours for them to hear back from the ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist then diagnosed me with blepharitis without having seen my eye and my symptoms not matching those of blepharitis at all. Not helpful and a complete waste of time.,1
"I was seen by a paramedic who told me that I should go to the hospital so I can get my bloods taken. I was hesitant because I know how long the wait times are there but I went anyway because I was in agony. The second I got to a&e I was greeted with such an unpleasant smell, it was horrible. I can hear patients snoring and screaming. I see a woman in a wheelchair with yellow decaying legs and arms and just left there in the corner? Like what? Anyways after my blood pressure was taken I was sent to the urgent care unit. HORRIBLE. I was made to have my blood pressure taken again by some rude woman who kept aggressively grabbing my arm. I was then met with a nurse after 4 hours!  She took my blood pressure AGAIN and this woman also aggressively touching me too. I was then made to do another ecg scan again. This woman had no clue what she was doing btw either. I went up to the receptionist to tell them I didn’t understand what was going on as I was told I was just getting a blood test then getting to leave. This woman said she would check with the nurse. She was distracted by her co-workers so I went back and asked her again. The nurse woman then rushed out within seconds, even though she told me I have to wait outside until i’m called because “some people wait over 7 hours” she was extremely rude. She told me to come with her. I followed her and she said that I was fine and that I didn’t need a blood test. I don’t really think that was up to her to decide, but alright. She grabbed my face and pulled my eyes down and said my eyes aren’t white so i’m fine. I should go to the gp If I want my bloods taken?!? Tf. These “nurses” (if you can even call them that) were extremely unprofessional. The next day, I was taken to another hospital were they had done the necessary tests and found out I could have a potential infection and was then prescribed tablets. Unless you want to wait 7 hours to be seen by a barley “qualified nurse” and come out worse than when you went in then come to this hospital. Absolute joke.",1
"I recently visited the Royal London Hospital Urgent Care center for testing for a heart rate variation, and unfortunately, my experience with the staff at reception was extremely disappointing. The boy at the reception seemed to have a lack of professionalism and respect for the patients.

Whenever I went to ask for the wait time, he would make inappropriate jokes about my condition and seemed to find it amusing that I was worried about my health. His flippant attitude was not only unprofessional, but it was also extremely insensitive and hurtful.

I was shocked to find that the urgent care center did not see patients urgently and the wait times were excruciatingly long. When I finally made it staff member who was completely uninterested in my health concerns. They asked me silly questions about why I was there, even though I had already explained my situation.

It was clear that the staff did not have a basic understanding of their job responsibilities and could not even comprehend the importance of treating patients with urgency, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Their lack of knowledge and understanding was extremely frustrating, and it made me question why they were even working in an urgent care center.

Overall, my experience with the staff at the Royal London Hospital Urgent Care center was extremely disappointing, and I would not recommend this facility to anyone seeking urgent medical care. The staff is incompetent, unprofessional, and completely lacks a sense of urgency when it comes to treating patients. It is a complete waste of time.",1
"Hospital needs to get a grip I don’t know how the place hasn’t been shut down yet the head of the hospital clearly don’t do back ground checks on staff
Mostly why people who don’t even speak English are allowed to work there.extremely rude and just not motivated to work and seem like they don’t give a toss and just want to get home and get paid at the end of the day the government really need to look into how the nhs are running there hospitals as if it isn’t sorted soon it’ll go down hill just like the rest of the country has there’s no coming back from this the hole we have all dug for ourselves has got to big it’s to late…..",1
"Incompetent staff, when I was referred here from the gp to seek medication at A&E it took 12 hours to be seen. Receptionist put me through the wrong name and I was made to rejoin the queue. When it was time to see the hospital gp they refused to prescribe the hospital only medication.",1
"If I could highlight zero stars I would. The reception team who work here obviously are just doing this to pay the bills - some of them don't even care about the patients, don't answer the phones and do not provide service with a smile. I have been under care here my entire life (25 years) and it's like people have just lost their humanity and don't care about sick people... it's just a job to them. Literally trying to get a hold of my records as I am not part of the hospital anymore and they literally pick up the phone then put it down. Useless people. As for the consultants, had a few including Dr y congenital condition can't be helped and I just have to ""live with it"" even though I went for 2 other opinions who said the complete opposite. One person tried to do inappropriate invasive investigations on me.",1

"6 years ago, my son was born in this hospital, and it was the worst experience I've ever had. My husband was running and looking for a doctor while I was giving birth alone, only when I started to lose consciousness, a doctor appeared. My son was crying nonstop six months after his birth and had a strabismus. A wild shortage of medical staff in London. I gave birth in Lonlon, as if in a field. Awful. I still remember it with great pain.",1
"If you come for Antenatal scans etc be prepared for a loooooong wait. Appointment was at 1500 and now its 1600. Dozens of Male and female partners of expectant mothers waiting outside. No direction whatsoever but RLH is doing it's best I guess. Well the front line staff are. I bet the higher echelons haven't got a clue.

Keep it up RLH staff. And thank you.",3
"My brother recently traveled to the UK for a holiday, and unfortunately, on the last day of his trip, he suffered from severe stomach pain and vomiting. Seeking medical attention, he went to The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, for urgent care. However, he had to wait for more than 3 hours before seeing a doctor, which was quite frustrating.

After the assessment, the doctor diagnosed him with gastritis, but my brother's family doctor back home suspected appendicitis based on his symptoms. Despite sharing this information, the NHS doctor dismissed the possibility of appendicitis and declined to perform a scan, stating, 'You can't get scans done in the UK like this.' Additionally, the doctor gave him a mild stomach ache medicine despite his severe pain and assured him that he was fit to travel the next day.

Tragically, my brother managed to reach India only to discover that his appendix had ruptured, leading to severe infection in his body. He had to undergo a highly risky and complicated surgery right away to save his life.

I believe the doctor who treated my brother in London was inefficient, and this experience has left me concerned about the healthcare system in England. We are grateful that my brother's life was ultimately saved in his home country, where he could receive the necessary medical care in time.",1
"sometimes i wonder, you pay taxes, you work non stop, you never ever use doctors. Surely if you have urgent appendix, you shoudnt be waiting 5 hours. Everyone is sent to emergency, yet you walk in and by the look of it, noone has any emergency, yet, they tell you 5 hours wait, although GP said urgent appendix care. Of course a person with appendix didnt wait and went to another place instead.. Also noone even phoned or checked what happened to the person with urgent appendix treatment. Maybe they collapsed somewhere. Trash system. Taxpayers should be supported, without taxpayers.. no free treatments to anyone. we are the only one working here..",1
Terrible waiting times even with a 0920 appointment. +3hours and still waiting. Staff don't know what's going on so you have to feel for them. Welcome to the NHS in 2023.,1
"I am a former patient at this hospital and have been here for 2 weeks. Since I’ve been here over time the health care has fallen drastically. I have been ignored multiple times over and over again down to simple thing like asking for pain killers, forgotten meals, put in wards with unsanitary conditions and not following basic health procedures. Since I have been here my mental health has not been put into consideration and have been telling the nurses and doctors and get a reply with” that’s not my problem” or if I need to move something being told to “do it your self”. Terrible health care and attitude. Half of the staff should not be working here if that is the attitude they bring for unwell patients.
I am going to write a formal complaint on the hm gov website and patient claim line and taking further action as this behaviour is appalling…",1
"I was there in urgent care unit for my wife
The doctor suggested to go to the GP care for her bleeding from uterus
As to scan the details.
Doctor said she will inform the GP and will note her suggestion in the medical record of my wife
But she didn't
As my wife went to gp ,they said,there is no record of doctors suggesion as we said",2
"My wife spent 2 weeks in intensive care here battling severe sepsis, necrotising fasciitis right after an emergency C-section. The nurses who gave my wife care around the clock here were incredible, absolutely incredible and their manners, behaviour and positive attitudes had a huge impact on my wife's mental state whilst being away from family and especially her newborn. The ward made every effort to accommodate my newborn and other children to visit at times which suited our family despite this being intensive care and no place for young children.

I want to say a special thanks to the surgeon who within less than 2 minutes of conversation reassured me that the surgery to cut out all infected skin on my wife's thigh would go well even though necrotising fasciitis is very rare and has a low survival rate.

Thank you for saving my wife's life.",5
"I've been in the A&E, and CDU days 22, 23, and 26 May 2023, and I had a great experience. Having spent a lot of time there I had the opportunity to observe what was going on.

The triage team is polite, friendly, and warm. The nurses always on top of every situation totally maxed out but always with a good mood, and occasionally have to handle unreasonable unsatisfied people that let emotions cloud their judgement. The doctors are friendly, professional and careful.

I had an issue in my throat and the team responsible to take care of me was awesome. The first time the issue was not solved, the second time it was.

A big thanks to all this professionals that everyday save patients from their physical pain misery. That every day expand the life span of all its patients. And they do it with a good mood and a smile in their face. These are the true terrestrial angels.

Obviously I waited. On public hospitals emergency departments it is a given that there will be waiting, I don't even understand why so many grown ups get shocked with it.",5
"I have been here multiple times and always have been impressed with the great treatment of all nurses, midwives, and doctors",5
"My mom is in coma because of these stupid doctors and nurses by giving her wrong medication, none of these stupid nurses got any experience DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL THEY WILL KILL YOUR LOVED ONE",1
I have been  trying since this morning to get through to dermatology regarding a referral and appointment. Spoke to one person around 10:30am who gave me another number to call.  I call and I wait in a queue then it switches to 'there's no-one available to answer your call'.   I am still waiting for my calls to be answered.  Its quite inconceivable that no-one actually answers the phones!,1
"Having visited the Royal London hospital multiple times with my partner during emergencies, I can confidently say that it was a complete disappointment each and every time. The waiting times were absolutely outrageous, surpassing a staggering seven hours on every occasion. It is utterly unacceptable to make patients wait for such an exorbitant amount of time, especially in emergency situations where every minute counts.
Furthermore, the overall cleanliness of the place left much to be desired. Filth and unhygienic conditions were apparent, raising concerns about the spread of infections and diseases within the hospital. It is deeply disheartening that a healthcare institution, which should prioritize cleanliness and hygiene, fails so miserably in this regard.
To make matters worse, the triage nurse Hannah displayed a dismissive attitude towards the opinions and concerns voiced by general practitioners. Instead of considering the insights and knowledge of these professional, the nurse seemed to undermine their expertise and brush off their
recommendations. In spite of the GP calling A&E in advance and providing a letter giving explicit instructions that my partner needed to be seen by a senior clinician.

This lack of collaboration and communication within the hospital's staff is highly concerning and detrimental to the quality of care provided.
Considering the consistently poor experiences I've had at the Royal London hospital, it comes as no surprise that this facility is in dire need of improvement according to CQC. It is truly disheartening that as tax-paying citizens, my partner and I were compelled to seek private medical care at our own expense after enduring such disgraceful treatment at a public institution.
In light of my experiences, I strongly advise anyone in need of emergency medical attention to stay well clear of the Royal London hospital. The extensive waiting times, unsanitary conditions, and dismissive approach of the triage nurses make it an unsuitable choice for receiving efficient and quality healthcare. It is my sincere hope that the management and staff of the hospital take immediate action to rectify these issues and prioritize the well-being of their patients.""",1
"Some of the nurses are great and kind. The rest is a complete joke. It has been 8 days I am in this hospital with a gallblader problem. First, it took more than 20 hours to see a doctor and have a 3-minute conversation regarding my CT-scan. Second, the doctors are extremely hard to reach out to. In 8 different days, I saw roughly 8 different doctors with no consistent set of actions we are supposed to follow. For example, I was supposed to be cured and discharged, then the recommendation changed to immediate operation (which never took place because of busy theatres), then I was supposed to be discharged again. Third, the doctors tend to completely abandon you. If one does not push and remind about oneself,  I have the feeling that one may not see a doctor for days. In sum, the overall patient experience is EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONALLY MANAGED. Unless you are ready to waste a lot of nerves, avoid this hospital.",1
"Had shoulder replacement all OK with surgeons etc come to ward different problems all together , I been here 5 days now instead of 2 as no doctors have visited.

"Very disappointed. Urgent health care whose service is not even close to the word urgent. Waited 9hrs to see a doctor for my husband who was in severe pain and was already on painkillers just to be told to contact the GP for a scan(that would take weeks) and take painkillers. Please don't visit this place if you are in urgent need of medical treatment.

Sadly there is no option to provide a negative rating for this pathetic service",1

They did tests and recommended urgent surgery, however they didn’t have a bed to admit me. So after spending 12 hours there, I couldn’t longer take the pain, the nurses were too overwhelmed with amount of patients to even monitor my temperature and give painkillers and fever reducers, so I left. The only alternative was to spend the night in the chair (where I spent all day). When I asked when the bed will become available, since I need surgery and I was admitted, they laughed",1

"My very nervous 8 year old daughter has attended children’s outpatients, children’s day surgery and the CT scan department over the last six months. The care she has received has been outstanding. Everybody we have encountered have been kind, compassionate, caring and supportive staff who as my daughter says “have really cared”. I could not have asked for better care.",5
Can't fault the hospital or doctors and nurses itself as i have been under Royal London for a year but have been today trying to get through to orthopaedic admissions and all that happens is the phone rings then it seems like someone puts the phone down on you.,3
"Was the most horrible experience of my life staff in ward 9E need some urgent training how to deal with patients and there knowledge, they are too busy with being on their phones and socialising with each other to help or deal with patients and if they come to you nothing but attitude management and staff are all the same RUDE even had a nurse assault a patient in front of everyone for pressing the bell!!",1

"I had my first baby at royal London hospital great care etc. However, I have always had issues with the antenatal receptionist department. For my first one and second one now. They are never helpful, I done a self referral form and have not heard anything I went all the way there just for them to say they need 2 weeks now how am I supposed to know that. Went all the way there for no reason. Also there’s so many of them working there instead of doing their job and being attentive to patients they are too busy chatting amongst themselves. I feel really uncomfortable asking them anything. Also when I told them when I was trying to call their line but no one ever responds picks up the call she’s blatantly knowingly saying it’s very hard to get through. Which I find strange because if there are so many of them working there why can’t no one pick up. This would have saved me a whole trip with me and my daughter if they only picked up the phone.",1
"A clean modern hospital. It may be construed as nitpicking but I feel it's an important point. When on the ward I requested a towel in order to wash and dry. There was none on the ward and my request after asking more than three times went unresolved until the following day when I finally got one. Not a huge problem overall but speaks to how if a small issue cannot be resolved/addressed how can the bigger issues ever be corrected ? Notwithstanding my nitpicking staff were kind polite, friendly and approachable and have my total support for what must be a difficult and frustrating situation  over wages. They deserve a decent raise for their hard work, pay them !! Paul Logan Ward 11 F",3
"Specialist doctors are fantastic and super helpful, as well as the doctors who helped direct us to the right department and lovely paramedics who asked if my mum was ok when we were in the lift heading down to the pharmacist.

Not happy with the receptionist, at all, we, was in the pharmacy to collect her prescription, estimated wait time was 30-45 mins. My mum had a small biopsy done before in the hospital just 30 20 minutes ago and was reacting to the anaesthetics, they had given her, she was feeling unwell, so she sat down, she then said she was feeling sick and dizzy, the pharmacist staff did nothing. I went to the main receptionist in the hospital, they could only offer me a sick pan and tissue, even when went there again, I had mentioned she was now actively vomiting and feeling dizzy like she wanted to collapse, again nothing. At this time the pharmacist expedited the prescription, so we had that.

I luckily found two lovely volunteer staff who helped me, one who went to look for a wheelchair, and the other who went around the building looking for staff to attend to my mum, she couldn't find anybody, as i had called my sister to pick us up, she was waiting in the car park (having to speak to the receptionist as there is building works going on around the area and traffic was hectic). The lovely volunteer lady, helped me pick up my mum and we walked her out of the hospital and she found a chair for her to sit one while we waited for my sister to reach the carpark as it has taken us long to reach her, so she had to drive around again, in this time the security guard lovely man, also helped us find my sisters car and stopped other cars from coming in so we can put my mum in the car. These three lovely people I cannot thank enough.

I was not going to write a review at all, but i felt it was needed, as when you enter the main hospital the receptionist is not welcoming and helpful at all.",2

"On the 13/10/2021 my mother attended the RLH for day surgery to have a hiatus hernia repaired, she was in good health and suffered with no high risk factors other than her issues with the hernia. While in the hospitals care she contracted a virus/bug and this wasn’t picked up by them, she had to stay in over night due to her vitals being low. On the 14/10/2021in the early afternoon she was discharged and had to endure a long car journey home(over 40 miles)in discomfort. When she arrived back at home I was there to greet her and could see she was in a lot of pain.. during a sleepless night she had sweating and complained about her breathing(which she told me over the phone while she was on the recovery ward that it was slightly shallow), these symptoms were taken as post surgery symptoms as the hospital gave no information on what to look out for, they also didn’t check her vitals before leaving the hospital, something I’m sure would have given an indication of her need for help. In the early hours of the 15/10/2021 around 13 hours after surgery she asked me to help change her nighty, while I was helping her she displayed confusion and said she couldn’t breath and felt as if she was going to faint, I told her to lean on me and in a beat she collapsed on the floor, I had to struggle and give her cpr while calling for an ambulance… the ambulance crew and air ambulance service worked on her for an hour but sadly she could not be revived… after weeks of her being with the coroner they confirmed she had died of acute respiratory failure caused by bronchial pneumonia(from whatever virus/bug my mother picked up from the hospital which with her immune system being low accelerated into BP), this caused her lungs not able to provide her body with oxygen and her heart went into cardiac arrest from working/struggling too hard. The hospital investigation took almost a year with them holding back paperwork and ultimately, not accepting liability. Their paperwork showed she was ok to be discharged, this is something I believe was not right. The media continues to report on failings nationally where the NHS and Trusts(in this case Barts)have failed patients with many different conditions, I believe the NHS is sadly full of people inadequate of doing the job and providing the proper care so many need. But things are being covered up. I believe the RLH killed my mother and they should have accepted their failure, because she deserved better. If you are attending this hospital I pray you don’t end up getting the same poor standard of care my mother did. The NHS is broken. Rest in peace my amazing mother.

New entry; As of August 2023, the current government has implemented the use of private hospitals to help with the backlog of waiting times. This is a move which should have happened during the pandemic. My mother had to wait two years to have a hernia the size of a grapefruit(by the time she was admitted to hospital)to be repaired. Too little too late for so many affected by the pandemic and industrial action.",1
"My stepson was a patient here in 11F and had excellent care. The staff were brilliant hard working and very caring; nursing staff, consultant and medical team were wonderful and very approachable. The catering staff too were attentive and went out of their way to attend to diet. I was so relieved when I flew over from Ireland to see him in such good hands as I am a nurse myself. The hospital is very clean with lovely art work and every person I encountered there was helpful and kind. Just to say also that I saw staff having to deal with a very abusive patient in the same ward and they coped with him in a very professional way continuing to care for him despite his horrendous behaviour.

I never expected that and again at the Royal London Hospital. didn't lie, everything is on the record.
All politicians commitment  do this and that but there’s Laing  ! To the attention of the authorities,
Thanks",1
I delivered my baby girl in the royal london hospital via vaginal delivery. Whole team through out has been very good my delivery was done by midwife tezz and julie and they were superb. I cant praise them enough. During aftercare student midwife Hawwa and midwife Sharmina as well as midwife Ricky helped me so so much. These 5 people made such a difference in my experience and my overall wellbeing. I cant praise them enough. Amazing 10/10 service Royal london hospital.,5
"Very very poor service. Came to my sons appointment, 7th Floor Children’s department Clinic 4. We arrived on time according to the letter we have got. They lady at the reception was very moody and repeatedly was saying ‘’you are late” i said no we are on time, she kept on saying we are late the system has different time. She logged as in after being rude for 5mins or so. This people working with children and don’t even have a welcoming approach. Children are watching them?!

Yet they’re the same people asking for pay rise? Which is paid by public AND cannot offer a distance service to public?????",1
"The worst staff and treatment I have ever seen in my life. Staff is rude, they are acting like it garage and they fixing cars not people.",1
"Absolutely rude staff, with shocking attitudes towards patients and families constantly judging you and making you feel a way. When you’re sick. Avoid renal and urology ward - judgemental and nasty especially nurse Femkemi jobeola. Very lazy and incompetent.",1
"My daughter had a orthopaedic surgery and she got treated very well for 2 days i would mention the doctors and nurses the nurse name but im unable to recall the names. I would definitely leave full starts.

Ambulance review is personally amazing
JACKEY AND RYAN helped my daughter get up the stairs and they were very lovely and definitely deserves awards as well as the nurses and the surgeon.

very good service",5
"The Royal London hospital most be the worst hospital in London. How can A&E tell
me to go to Urgent treatment centre. be here for 5 hours",1
"Would just like to send a big hug and loads of gratitude to the staff that assisted me last night. I had a nasty fall and my knees were swollen and painful all day long at work so I took myself off to the closest A and E which was The Royal...lovely helpful, competent and very caring and assuring staff, that helped me to understand that my injuries were just some nasty bruising and nothing to be alarmed about.
A massive thank you and such heartfelt gratitude at a wonderful and comforting experience...
Thank you to all...xxx",5
"I definitely recommend this hospital, specially the neonatal care and the maternity services. I have my C- section here done in August 2023.
Thank you for existing and for your involvement. Great consultants, doctors!",5
"BE VERY CAREFUL ALLOWING YOURSELF OR FAMILY TO GO TO THIS HOSPITAL. MY MOTHER WENT IN ALIVE AND NOW SHES DEAD, THEY COULDNT WAIT TO PUT HER ON MORPHINE AND MIDAZOLAM WHICH LED TO HER PAINFUL DEMISE AND PAINFUL DEATH. YOU DO NOT GIVE ANYONE WITH BREATHING PROBLEMS MORPHINE.  MIDAZOLAM KILLED MY MOTHER, THIS IS HAPPENING TO SO MANY.  THEY WILL TRY AND COVER THIS UP.  MY MOTHER TOLD ME THEY WERE TRYIBG TO KILL HER.",1
Not responding at all  from Anti natal department ...they don't know if someone is serious and need emergency treatment at that time and also they dont pick up the phone...we haven't got an appointment since 3 weeks since we filled and submitted the form for a particular test .....please try an understand or give proper response bcoz we all are expecting response and please have some courtesy for humanity,3
The Plastics team where fabulous in reconstructing my husband's severed nerves and tendons in his hand. It was an emergency surgery and all went very well!,5
Worst A and e avoided this hospital even their other services dentistry  and cancer care are very bad in my opinion I was taken here because I was told the care and the treatments were better and advanced as it’s a fairly new hospital  I  had a melanoma removed in this hospital worst experience ever ..,1
"I attendend an outpatient appointment at the  Orthopaedic department two years ago, and the orthopaedic doctor was out of the premises and did not show up until 2 hours passed. Then patients started to  check with the receptionist and ask them to  enquire about him until he at last came. Waste of time as he did nothing but saying you're not 20 and these knees are not a 20 year old person's. He prescribed nothing and he absolutely did nothing but talking down with absolute humiliation. I complained about this behaviour and other things which caused me discomfort.

As a result they needed to send a strong message to whoever anticipated to complain, so they offered me a follow up appointment and phoned to tell me not to attend because it would be a telephone based which wasn't mentioned in the letter. Then I waited for the appointment for a whole day but no one phoned and each time I called the reception, they would say that I had to continue waiting, and surprisingly, no one phoned.
As a result, I contacted the appointment department and they thankfully, arranged another appointment and the orthopaedic doctors/specialists repeated themselves, made me wait for the whole day, and no one called 😒. Hats off and a clap 👏 at last you are good at something!",1
The fact there is no parking for patients after a surgery  is a disgrace should not have a hospital without decent parking for it's size!,1
"If I was able, I was not give even this star.
I went on Saturday night to this hospital, because I start to have pain on the back of my head and after my left eye became full with blood.
I wait more than 2 hours for a doctor to see me and this didn't happen. Literally they were seeing everyone else but not me.
I had to came to this hospital because is near my workplace, as all this happen while I was working.
When I ask someone when the doctor will be able to see me, I've been told that I still have to wait.
How long? All night or till the point that something really bad to happen?
Shame on you!!!!
I left the hospital and I went to the one near my home.
Avoid this hospital because is a joke!!!!",1
"I had very bad experience in this hospital  2 times in 2019 when I delivered my son and my daughter in 2022 ,the midwives are very bad I asked for the epidural I was crying and supplied them but they didn’t care they was laying all the time by telling me she is coming (the anistesit) they let me suffer two times the midwife was shouting at me and my husband she was very rude and scary.horrible midwives there .I don’t like them .🤮🤮🤮.",1
"Worst hospital I’ve ever been to and experienced in my life waited over 5 hours fine fair enough I’m not the only sick person but to then not even be checked out properly I was in so much pain and had waited that whole time to be rushed out and given a prescription tht I couldn’t even pick up today !!! I had been there since  3 and didn’t leave till 9 I don’t even no what’s wrong with me still now
Worst service from nhs I’ve ever gotten and don’t think I’ll ever want to return to another hospital after my experience today felt very pushed aside not listened to and belittled ! I suffer from anxiety and depression which thanks to your staff has triggered me off thanks for nothing",1
Awful place. Total shambles.  Utterly disorganised.  People are treated like cattle.  Levels of incompetence that I have never experienced before.,1
"Children A&E staff was extremely disappointing, very rude, as long they know English is not your first language, they acted like they own this hospital. We waited 4hrs for children A&E. I asked them couple of times, how long gonna be to see the doctor, they said after 2 patients. We waited 1.5 hours to 2 patients.",1
"Worthless of the one star because of the long waiting hours after taken the X-Ray. Though, I came here in the emergency unit, they made me to wait 4 hours to give the two medicines. I have frustrated this experience in the hospital. Hope the management understand the patient's problem and they help them without getting delayed.",1
"Paediatric ward shocking service.

Giving an 14 months baby 5ml of water instead of 50ml! Giving heavy medication back to back instead of giving time between medication! Then not willing to give medication for the symptoms from their own neglect!!!! Sometimes they blame agency nurses when they should really be reading their the notes themselves.

Dermatology. If you got cancer than good luck, you'll be place on urgent but wait for months. Worst part they won't tell you who your consultant is so you can't even chase it up yourself.",1
Joined A&E Q at 1500. Moved to Urgent Treatment Centre Q at 1600. Its now almost 2000. Am told another 45min wait estimated. My back is hurting really badly. Too many painkillers. And not a doctor in sight. The NHS isn't saved at all.,1
"I had birth a week ago in this hospital and honestly, I could not ask for more. The midwifes and doctors has been really nice and patient with my labour. The service they gave me during and after the birth has been incredible. I highly recommend this hospital if any of the mum’s to be are thinking where to get birth. Rooms and spaces are complete and beautiful sights. My labour has been a good experience thanks to this wonderful team of midwifes, the environment has been helpful as well ❤️",5
They have added in a QR tag system and also some soothing music in the Accidents and Emergencies building. They have a bicycle parking near the Urgent Treatment Center.,5
"A nurse just went ballistic on ward 11F last night,shouting at 4am and waking everyone up,she was also very aggressive and rude to me(patient on the ward) nurses and patients were scared. Going to be part of my complaint ,shame as she’ll probably be made a scapegoat to a more systemic problem on the ward with nursing staff.it’s not just her that was problematic/deliver  poor care though it’s not the case for all of them,for patients.Not sure how patients recover in this situation.Really disturbing ward.Real crazy ward and wouldn’t wish anyone else in it.have been in hospital many times and not seen anything like this before. I’m also a doctor so know about patient care/nursing competence.Really unprofessional and don’t know what else to say really.Be careful if you or your relatives end up on this ward",1
"Im not really sure what really needs to improve just want to commend everybody in the Royal London Hospital, Im very happy with all the services and with the room that we have had, my wife was in 6E to Theatres to HDU then 8F ward. The delivery was kinda long due to complications, our baby was a week overdue but they tried their best to make it as normal delivery however baby didnt go down and theyve decided to do a CS and the procedure went complicated. My wife went to critical condition she loss 3.5ltrs of blood I was really anxious and nervous but at the same time something special I felt, I didnt even feel even 1% that my wife’s life is in danger even the case was an absolute life threatening. Im so impress how they handled the operation, from start to critical phase, they were so organised. I wish I can remember all their names so I can drop it because they really deserve all the compliments. I still have a lot of positive things to say but Ill just cut it short. From the bottom of our hearts , we are really thankful and grateful to all of you. From Utilities(always keeping our room clean and food delivery always on time, securities going in and out the facility(very strict which is really impressive) midwives and nurses) they are so caring, they made my wife feel secured all the time, all of the midwives who held our baby seems like their hands has a magic , every time baby cries they just hold our baby and carry her in an instant baby stopped crying, she is our first baby that why we are not familiar how it goes, they even  helped and thought us how to change vest and diapers, rounds and routine check and call bell always on time , such an amazing job well done, to all doctors, anaesthetists, consultants , surgeons, you all are an absolute legends, how organised and calm were you on that major procedure was unbelievable, and lastly to our  room 8F bed 27, feels like we are in a private hospital with an outstanding service. 5 stars. Kudos to each and everyone. Respect and much love. Thank you so much again from the bottom our hearts. She was admitted from 03/04/23 at 6E to labour room to HDU (currently 08/04/23 at 8F not yet discharged. Please track all the staff who took care of us, they deserve all the compliments and recognition) we really appreciate everything and we felt so loved here. We love you all. So far the best caregivers we experienced and an absolute lifesaver. Bless you all.",5
Awful experience day nurse are good icu night nurse horrible they timing is not existent they forgot about important things like transport home even thought it was confirmed in the morning,2
Good transport links along with good disabled access. Well signposted despite alot of building works going on. If you're not sure about anything just ask staff or guards. This place can get busy so be patient.,5
Am 4 month pregnant how to get midwives gp say hospital will give hospital say gp will give but no one referred me a midwives I called this number they picked up call after requesting for midwives few minutes later they hanged my called,1
Worse hospital ever! Been there two years ago they couldn’t diagnose my issue made something else up... I went second time and in serious agony and they got me waiting for 3 hrs! I’d rather suffer and die with the pain then waste  my time in that hospital like a dog,1
"The renal department is the worst, especially the ladies who do the blood tests on the 9th floor. Very rude and disrespectful.",1
"Don’t go there please! I was left for a long waiting time that I thought it was the day of judgment. Then when I asked the receptionist he said you might wait between 5 minutes to 6 hours. I can’t believe this level of service I received when I had a swollen broken hand. After 5 hours wait I just left to a different hospital as I couldn’t trust my broken hand with any doctors there especially knowing that I was in extreme pain.
NHS DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!",1
Absolutely amazing care received from the A&E department from start to end. For those complaining try and do what they do!,5
"Thank you TRLH 🙏
A friend of mine got married to one the nurses here who is very kind caring and full of understanding, makes me what to do the same 🤔   FB  Mr.Kings121",1
"Really bad hospital,in labour we’d need to wait 4 bed more then 4 hours doctors nurses are just sitting and talking very rubbish hospital,they have no value of human being",1
"The Antenatal appointment clinic needs to give patients their correct direct line. The numbers written on their appointment letter does not work for me. I called the switch line and again when I’ve been transferred, nobody answers. I called 8:30am to at least be one of the first people to call and it’s been an hour and still haven’t had a answer
:( it’s just really frustrating, especially when it’s urgent.",2
"Worst hospital ever with treatment
No communication or care plan
Long waiting times for appointments and less doctors no valid reason given for any sort of treatment refusing care for patients.
pals service doesn't take anyone seriously and doesn't wanna do their jobs don't know why they even open
Ward
Wouldn't recommend even going to a&e they will send you home even tho something is wrong with the patient and just say your fine they will do something once the patient is on their last breath.
They kept sending me home with gallstones didn't bother examining and checking as a whole what the pain is until my stone got really big they had to remove all my gallbladder and lost so much weight delayed surgery aswell kept me nil by mouth for 3 days without giving me a reason.
They will eventually kill people giving the wrong medications and forcing people to do things without consent",1
I've spent a lot of time in hospital I'm different countries but this is the worst A&E I've ever been to by a mile. Go to Guys' & St Thomas' if you can which is a proper hospital.,1
"I would give you 100+ stars to nurse Maxine who works in the ‘urgent treatment centre’ , she was so friendly , kind and caring , honestly made me feel much better just by being around a bubbly person and she knows her stuff! Honestly felt safe and felt like I was in really good hands. So a big big thank you to you!!! :)",5
"Had a positive outpatient orthopaedic appointment here. Didn’t have to wait long for my name to be called, managed to get an X ray done right away (radiography facilities right next door to the clinic) and sat down with the consultant to review it minutes later. Everything ran very smoothly and staff were lovely and kind.",5
"I had in amazing hands. My cesarian was perfect, no complications or horrible scar, the big team was very good, the food was nice, the room was very clean and comfortable, the security was perfect, the nurses are super kind, the maternity doens't smell like hospital.
So, I had best and calm time.",5
"AVOID THIS HOSPITAL!!! This is the most irresponsible hospital I have ever been to. I was feeling sick for a couple of weeks and waited more than four hours in urgent care regardless of that I have booked an appointment with 111. The doctor said I was healthy and prescribed me naproxen. She refused to run any test for me and let me go in 5 mins. Then I went private and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and heart conditions later. I was so mad with this hospital, they don’t care about patients and not professional and responsible at all. Worst ever nhs experience. Total waste of time.",1
Am glad and honoured to get a chance for my wife to work in adult critical care unit.thanks for the opportunity .,5
I am very pleased with the service I have received within this hospital. The staff were professional and the place was clean. There isn't anything I can point out that is negative. I just wanted to say Thank you so much to Dr Tanner from the Urgent treatment centre. He was lovely and made me feel comfortable. He knew exactly what he was doing and gave me the right treatment I needed. Other doctors and hospitals couldn't give me the help I needed. I made the right choice to visit this hospital and was lucky enough to have met Dr Tanner. Brilliant doctor and hospital. I would recommend this hospital.,5
I am submitting here my 5star review on this royal London hospital but only in the name of an angel 👼 “SOPHIA”👼 the staff nurse who helped me out to dress my wounds through the right way after I get mentally harassed by a doctor her name is “NAHEEDA RAHMAN” . I find out her name by asking because she used to wear her “IDENTITY CARD WRONG WAY TO HIDE  HER NAME AND DETAILS FROM THE PATIENTS”. I strongly believe she wearing the identity card wrong way to hide her identity details to the clients because she knows that her character is very rude with no mercy and she enjoy in her heart others pain. NAHEEDA RAHMAN is abusing the patients in that hospital I got very very bad experience she verbally abused me mentally harassed me oh god🥲🙏. (It happened on 02/06/23 early morning),5
I gave birth to both of my babies here in a span of 15 months. By far the most amazing service by the maternity and labour ward. This midwives I had during labour and aftercare were by far some of the best people I have met! So lovely and caring. This one particular midwife who referred herself as ‘Aunty Rose’ didn’t leave my side for a second as my contractions were ongoing and severe. I had another student midwife who too was amazing! I can’t fault a single one of the staff I met at Royal London. The aftercare team also were exceptional. Thank you Royal London and to the maternity team for everything!!,5
"Whoever is dealing with the phone calls is extremely rude(any departments I have had to call to regarding my partner's pregnancy), however they seem to be very understaffed so it might be just stress.

Once we were admitted into the birthing room we received the utmost careful and kind care from the midwive's team at Ward 8B, all of them lovely and very enthusiastic whilst being kind and understanding with my partner's needs.

Jessica, the head midwife, is an absolute angel.

Edit: Birth went well, both my partner and myself are extremely happy, we got moved into ward 8f, the whole thing changed... half of the team still lovely, the other half absolute witches, looking extremely annoyed at questions from first time parents and not helpful at all, being looked down and treated like an idiot despite being as kind as possible and understanding in the fact that they are understaffed and under stress, very disappointed with some of them, to be fair after the experience I cannot longer recommend the hospital, I will not change the 5 star review because in ward 8b they were absolute angels",5
"My husband was in Intensive Care for over 50 days on a ventilator, sedated for over 2 weeks. The care he received was exemplary. The Family Liaison Team, particularly Professor Hinds were amazing along with the Chaplain  Tony. We are so fortunate that he was taken to your hospital as there are others closer to us. We will be forever grateful to the doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly in caring for him. He is now in our local hospital,  clinically doing really well and starting physio.  We can never thank you enough.  You're all fantastic and do an amazing job.",5
Very bad experience!! I was waiting for 5 hours to see doctors and they handle it unprofessionally . Just a simple blood test took me 5 hours. So disappointed… UK government needs proper attention.,1
"If I could give the night shift at the labour ward no star I would. I had 2 babies at this hospital and both times I had the same experience. Morning staff absolutely fantastic and kind. Night shift staff absolutely horrible. Imagine being nervous and scared to ask for help when u r in a vulnerable situation. The level of rudeness is astonishing. Why work in a place like this if u r not an approachable person. Night staff defo need good practice training. If you are not happy in ur job don't take it out on the ppl u are supposed to look after. I will leave u with this comment that a midwife said to me just this morning. My cousin was giving birth her baby wasn't drinking enough and he had low blood sugar. I ask the first midwife I saw for help to possibly get my cousin to breast feed him. She said if he has low blood sugar he will need the bottle as it was faster. I said I tried but he isn't driving which is why I needed help. She proceeded to say to me ""oh well"" I was in such shock I asked her to repeat what she said and didn't because her colleagues came to the desk. I decided to complain to the senior midwife in charge and as I was explaining what happened the midwife in question came to my face and pointed at me that I was a lier. The other midwife had to hold her back. Me in shock thought that I now had a witness on how aggressive and rude this lady was but this senior midwife only defending her colleague and no one apologies and she didn't hold her accountable for are disgusting behavior in a ward wer ppl were in labour.

I know this will never been sorted as I have heard a lot of ppl have experience the same behavior from night shift staff in the maternity level.",1
"I cannot thank the doctors and nurses enough at Royal London Hospital (Stroke unit Ward 11c) for looking after our Dad and​ ​​the amazing hardwork and dedication it takes to not only take care of patients, but ​also ​the family, visitors, ​​going above and beyond. Forever grateful 🥹❤️❤️❤️",5
"Visited the a&e with my 11 year old daughter and we were pleasantly surprised after seeing the low rating reviews. The building is very welcoming, modern and clean. Staff were friendly and although it was really busy, we were in and out in 2 hours.",5
"Worked in Royal London Hospital before,mostly in 9E/9F/10E/12Fand HDU(High Dependency Unit) and just to let you know is a Terrible place to work.
Always short of staff, lack of communication,inexperienced nurses,no proper handover sheet,racist people and putting in danger patients safety.",1
"I'd like to thank the nurses and doctors for showing their great support and effort during this crisis and hope they can carry on this great work which is helping out millions of people.

However the admins are very poor in terms of communication. When trying to get details submitted quick and effeciently, they are easily distracted by their colleagues and makes patients repeat their answers too many times. Continuously blanking patients delays them from being checked quickly. You would think A&E was supposed to be a quick and helpful service. They need to understand people are here for an urgent reason and require quick support. By having poor communication such as the examples mentioned above disrupts the flow of patients advancing to gain support in their particular problem.

I have taken my mum and dad before and I have not yet had a good experience. My mum was barely able to walk and we could not find anything to support her. I had to support her when walking to the admins. Yet they do not even show any sort of care and continue to work slow and rudly without considering the state my mother was in.

This unprofessional behaviour needs to stop in order for patients to be comforted whilst they are in pain.

Apart from that I respect all the work everyone is doing especially the doctors who show a lot of support and care.",2
"I attended the A&E department. The receptionist staff at both A&E and so called urgent treatment centre were unwelcoming and frankly quite rude. No eye contact with patients, dismissive attitude, service that at any other customer focused institution would not be acceptable. Doctor at the urgent treatment center did not seem to pay much attention to what I was saying, I felt like she wanted to finish assessing me ASAP. I left feeling that I really would not like to be treated in the hospital like that. Unpleasant experience.",2
"This place is a JOKE . Big tell tail sign that the NHS has had it . My daughter had issues breathing today . Took to A&E in an ambulance just to be seen by a nurse who then sent her round to this clown GP Dr Rahim . Keep that name in mind if you ever see him think his job is just to fob people off . Literally sending people with broken bones to so called ""URGENT CARE CENTRE"" More like zero care centre. This hospital has taken a big dive. PROFIT OVER CARE .",1
"An abhorring behavior from the staff on the antenatal unit. Absolutely zero empathy, treating patients like a huge corporation would treat insects. The assistants are acting like they own the place and making pregnant women feel miserable.

It just makes my stomach turn thinking about it - the managers of this hospital should be ashamed and the doctors employed here who have sworn an oath should know better than to let non-medical personnel treat future mothers like this.",1
"The urgent medical care center at this hospital has not lived up to expectations for patients especially at the weekend where poor hygiene is the main concern in the reception area of the building. Rubbish bins unemptied, litter on the floors, discarded used face masks .Very poorly for an NHS hospital in Whitechapel.",1
"My Gf was over last night with a severe infection. After calling a doctor at her insurance and getting tested, they confirmed she needed antibiotics extremely urgently. Well after 5hours , she got send back home with an OTC medicine. She started shacking, the infection got worse and had to be treated else were. The treatment , the service itself and the building is what you would expect from communist russia. Unless you are dying and have no choice, dont even come near this place. Absolutely disgusting treatment",1
Looked clean. Easy to get to. Very busy hospital. Lots of services there to offer. The staff were good with us and friendly. So we cannot moan about the service.,3
"It was an unacceptable response time to have the receptionist Norma log into her computer as she ‘just came on the shift’. Knowing full well I explained to her that my mother is having cardiac pain symptoms and she is to be seen IMMEDIATELY per the practitioner’s instructions! Norma sat on her computer and took longer than 5 minutes to log in. These 5 minutes were crucial to my mother. This is unacceptable response time to have a patient with cardiac pain stood waiting for 5 minutes. Norma did not even care to look up and reassure my mother that all will be okay - I MEAN where’s the human chivalry?! For anyone who would like to be wary of this particular person please notice her 5inch long acrylic nails. And I mean 5inch. It’s terrible to see how poor the service has become from the first point of contact. Receptionists working in the healthcare division like Norma tend to patronise a person who is already feeling anxious, scared and concerned about their loved ones health.",1
"The treatment I received from the obstetricians in the maternity ward (by Doctors Soha and Lucy) was amazing. I felt I was in the best possible hands to have my baby. Thank you so much RLH, and the NHS.",5
The worst hospital in the entire world had my finger bitten by a random person went to A&E they saw my after so long it felt like i was gona bleed to death than had surgery the next day they sent me home in so much pain i told the nurse and Dr that i have had 4 kids like all 4 c section but never felt worse pain than this they said go home and rest i was in so much pain i was physically crying the nurse told me i am discharged i should just go home while i was waiting for my medication they told me to wait on a chair in the corridor. I was discharged at 3pm and iwas now 11pm still no meds i was in so much pain that i left without the medication its like they dont care they did some messed up surgery they ended up making my finger bent and short i will sue them i am going through my solicitors i will advise anyone not to go there 🚫❌🚫❌🚫❌,1
"I was born in this hospital now my 2 kids were born too soon my third one is on the way so far I had the best experience in the birth ward.

Yes I was also waiting for 12hours once when my daughter broke her ankle and the nurse said she's only 3years she just has pain and had to force to get a x-ray and find her tibia bone broke in half",5
"I visited Urgent Treatment Unit, South Tower, Royal London Hospital yesterday. The Doctor was good but the nurse behaved so rude and did not provide any privacy or dignity while doing my ECG. I was almost naked. I asked for a gown to cover myself but she did not provide me any. That was so embracing that I was very uncomfortable and had another lesson from them. It did happened previously but that time I managed to get a sheet to cover myself while my ultrasound scan was taking place. Funny thing is that they did not know I am a healthcare professional too and I know what mistake they are making to the patient. Enough is enough!!
They should improve them self. The management should keep eye on what is going wrong. Are the patients happy or not with service they are providing. Please speak up if anything going wrong with anybody while taking NHS services.",1
"Terrible service. Careless people that with an emergency they don't give you the right priority and they enjoy being rude just because they are on the other side of the desk. What a sad experience. This is not acceptable! My mum was collapsing in front of them and they acted like nothing happened! They instead asked me to wait for my turn and stay away(almost outside the door) when there was NO QUEUE! (I had already been refused from the ambulance because ""my mum was BREATHING"" so i took an uber for the second time in the same night).Then, they also pointed out my mum has a different nationality with a laugh whilst checking in. I've never been that scared in my life because it looked my mum was really about not making it that day. And people at the reception made me feel so angry and frustrated. I still can't believe the way they treated us. Just the thought gives me shivers again.
This is HEALTH, if you don't know why you're doing this job DON'T DO IT!",1
I am a first time mum and was very scared and in dilemma which hospital to choose. I made a right decision. Doctors and midwifes were amazing. I felt like I am in a private care. They were so professional and genuine care about me and my baby. So sad that I was not in a state to remember doctors and midwifes names as I would write them a letter to thank them.  One of the best decisions I made is to choose The London Royal hospital to have my baby. Thank you.,5
"Good Facilities but not enough beds to accommodate patients, Doctors always trying to discharge you, without fully investigating the issue, my husband went in with symptoms now which seem obvious but we didn’t realise what it was before they told his sore chest and leg probably from muscle damaged, (doesn’t do any sporting activities)and they did an X-ray and CT scan said it was all fine and went to Whipps Cross the next day as it got worse turns out he had 3 Bloodclots in his lungs (1 being a saddle blood clot) and one in his leg. And they currently have discharged my father in law, he’s at Newham and they’ve said he shouldn’t have been allowed to go home let alone been discharged.",2
"Amazing specialists, first of all they are people. Gynecological surgery. Thanks to Dr. Michael AND the whole amazing team. 10 stars",5
"Came to a Dental Appointment, no one at the main hospital reception could give clear instructions on how to get here, asked about 3 hospital reception staff and also the so called security guard who couldn't utter a single sentence but as soon 2 young girls came upto him he was fine with his speech!, finally found a nurse who was very helpful, then when we came to the dental reception they asked to confirm my daughters details as i finished, she started to ask me if my name is as same  as my daughter.i was like what is happening here???? She could have easily said can I get your name also
but I guess that was to much to ask. Never coming here again. Or I will get a referral to another hospital even if its further.terrible customer service. The actual dentists were OK. So it's not a reflection on them but rather the support network around the hospital.",2
"My mother had brain surgery in this hospital 2years ago just before the pandemic started. Now 2 years later she has had no follow up scan to ensure her tumour has not grown back. They send her appointments then just cancel them weeks before she is due let alone that, they are not even face to face. They stated when they done surgery she will receive yearly checks to make sure no growth is appearing. We have had to go private as my mother had alot of pains in her head also to ensure there is no growth, and this hospital refuse to help! Not 1 face to face check up in over 2years is absolutely disgusting! People can NOT use the pandemic as an excuse no more as everywhere is open everywhere is running as normal! If you can go shopping or to a club and  be surrounded by people im sure you can do a scan on someone recovering from surgery! i am fed up and disgusted by the lack of care this hospital has for its patients/ex patients
I also do not understand these telephone appointments. Are you able to see if there is a tumour growing back over the phone now. 😒🤔",2
"I used to live close to this hospital and then I moved to king cross. I got pregnant and I  didn't transfer my GP yet so had no choice but be seen by RLH antenatal. I had to travel an hour to get to RLH and sometimes I'd be 5 mins late as its hard to find parking and also waiting for the slow lifts that take ages to go up to the 8th floor. They were quite rude about me being late but didn't try to understand my reasons.
Which clever guy or girl came up with the idea to place maternal ward and clinic on the 8th floor of the building??!
SECOND issue was that at my first appointment I was given a male sonographer which I refused as I find it uncomfortable to be seen by a male sonographer due to my Muslim faith. They told me I had to wait extra long for a female sonographer which I didn't mind. The issue came when every time I had an appointment I was given the same male sonographer and each time i had to refuse to be seen by him and had to wait few more minutes to be seen by a female one. If the hospital was efficient they would learn from the mistakes. The area this hospital is located at are predominantly the patients are from the Muslim background, and yet they do not accommodate for the Muslims. They should have changed my appointed sonographer after the first appointment rather than doing the same thing in each appointment.",1
"Awful experience - ER only

I went to the emergency department with my mum, whose health condition was severe. We were received by a receptionist who yelled at us ""Wait there, no one has called you""

We then had to wait around 3 hours before being called. I did it outside with other patients as the room was full. Meanwhile, a lady with a 2 year old fainted not being able to wait more. My mum was then called to be told it was just an allergy. They gave her a ripped piece of paper which is not more than 7 centimetres long with the names of two medicines. 2 days later my mother fell unconscious with severe anaphylaxis.

All l am going to say is that everyone should do what they enjoy and are enthusiastic about. Especially in a hospital, if they can't really be bothered to care and support patients they shouldn't be there at all. If things are done, they should be done properly. I understand that they work very hard, that they could be having a bad day and that they treat 100s of patients everyday, but we are talking about lives aren't we? 2 things no one can fool you about are interest and enthusiasm. The ridiculous piece of paper gave it all away. My mum didn't get any blood test done or anything at all and consequently she almost passes away 2 days later.

I hope right people get to the right place.

The ER should be a serious place to get advice from, not a circus.",1
"Emergency service very bad 😔
Long time waiting for 6 hour
Today my new experience I am so sorry 😞",1
"The Royal London has been there for me during the most injury prone few months of my life. They are clearly really busy but despite delays everyone has been unbelievably kind and the nurses have made me laugh when I would have been crying!

The hand therapy team are so nice and talented - Anne was honestly amazing and gave me the best care possible.

I'm so so grateful for everything and you can tell how hard everyone is working!",5
"I visited this hospital for a small problem that was causing me a lot of pain, I must say that the medical staff are very professional, very empathetic and try to help even if they are very busy, I think especially in this period you need to be more understanding and grateful for work they perform to help others. I hope not to visit this place soon 😄😄 but if that happens I know I'll be in good hands.
Thanks to the Doctor and the nurses who made my experience much more relaxing and less worrying yesterday.",5
"Was under oral surgery dept for many years and had surgery. When i started saying how much pain i was in etc., they didnt really want to now.the McMillan nirse left me hi and dry and the surgeon left very quickly fot another hospital.To be honest they were hopeless. All very nice until i was left in pain and discomfort. Would not attend here again",1
"For a NHS Hospital this is one of the best hospitals in east London

A car crashed into me whilst riding my bike and I had to go A&E, so I decided to go King George hospital on barley lane, Goodmayes, and they said they didn’t have any A&E doctors.

Then I went to Queens hospital in Romford and they had one member of staff assessing the very long queue of people and they were only allowing one extra person.

Then I went to Royal London Hospital and they saw me within about 20 minutes and I was seen by the specialists within about an hour!

From beginning to end everyone was helpful, attentive, efficient, and it was overall a pleasant experience, even though I was in a lot of pain from the accident.

If you’re looking to go to a hospital in east London then don’t bother with the other two and go here.

Hopefully you don’t ever need to go hospital!",5
"The worst hospital in the whole of UK in my opinion. If you go there for emergency treatment you will be disappointed, doctors and nurse are useless and dont know much or what their doing, they dont want to see you and will try to send you away.

Their doctors and staffs are just working to earn and let their shift go pass quick without treating anybody so they can go home.

Seen People suffering passing out, crying in pain, but zero attention to them. Disgusting behaviour from staffs and nurses.

The tax we pay goes to this useless hospital and its staff and useless doctors, wish we had a option to opt out from paying our tax money to this particular hospital.",1
So.... after waiting 4 days for my induction ...I have now waited almost 12 hours to see a doctor to even start the induction of labour (still do not know when one is going to be available) ... how is this acceptable?,1
"It is really sad that i have to travelled all the way to the hospital to find out twice that my appointment is cancelled. Twice no one bothered calling me. It is actually sad.I would not even give 1 stars because there nothing less. My appointment was cancelled twice. First i traveled always to my appointment and got told Doctor off sick. No one bothered calling me. After that I have to call Gynaecology team to book this appointment by myself on the phone for hours to get one in three months time. Guess what I am not well.  I am really sick. I am bleeding every day.i travelled again to hospital got told again you don't have appointment it suppose to be telephone consultation. I asked why no one called me. Do I have to travel all the way to hospital waisting my money and time before finding out....it is telephone consultation??
She said no....So why no one call me?? Have you got my number is your system. Yes the lady said. So now I'm back to start again. GP's  are not picking up the phone. To get GP appointment it is a headache. And it is going circles and circles until the problem turns bad and that's it. No one care. Which is really sad 😔.  Can even get blood test done.",1
"It is one of the best hospital in London, UK. I visited once because of emergency issues. So my review for the doctor and nurses are very nice, attentive, kind and helpful. The hospital building is very clean. I never seen or experienced any discriminations in this hospital and the staff were very efficient with their time management, especially at A&E. Everything major has been done like the blood test. I was impressed with A&E services. Thank you all.👍😊💕🇬🇧",5
"The reception staff at the antenatal clinic are unprofessional, rude and dismissive. Pregnancy can be a stressful time for parents; please try to show some humanity. I understand it can be a busy and stressful working environment and not always fairly remunerated, believe me I know, I used to work as a receptionist in a health clinic. But it is still possible to foster a culture of respect and understanding for the people on the other side of the desk.

I have so far had 3 bad experiences with these staff members. Each time they have treated me as a distraction from their personal conversations, disbelieved information I was told by a midwife over the phone and generally been aggressive and unpleasant. I have been left feeling stressed, tired and upset. I overhead and witnessed other patients being treated in a similarly unprofessional manner. If the individual staff members are unable to take it upon themselves to behave decently to patients and take pride in their work, then perhaps management can better incentivise and train them as a cohort.

I hasten to add that all of the midwives and sonographers I have encountered have been professional, friendly and efficient.",1
Waiting from 4 o’clock. Doctor didn’t even realised two patients are left they finish there shift. I was there for pain . Omg if there are like that thn why we need to go hospital emergency 😡😡 very disappointed,1
"I recently had the misfortune of having to be attend hospital and subsequently be admitted following a serious fracture after a fall. However, Royal London hospital were amazing - from being checked in at reception of A&E and the receptionist recognising how serious my condition was, and then rushed by the triage nurse to resus. I was then seen immediately by a lovely ED consultant and then a wonderful ED registrar, both of whom was reassuring, and kind. The nursing staff throughout were lovely as well, and made sure I was comfortable and pain free. I was then admitted to the neurosurgery ward, 12E and again, the excellent care continued, with doctors and nurses all being friendly, caring, and easy to talk to. It can be hard to provide the care you want, given the current cutbacks and poor funding that the NHS has suffered, so the care and dedication each member of staff demonstrated, was even more impressive. Thankfully I was able to be discharged fairly soon due to having surgery (again, the whole surgical team from anaesthetist to theatre nurses were amazing), but I'm just so grateful to have been able to receive such fantastic care after such a frightening experience. Thank you all so much!",5
"I when A&E on 24 jan. the service I got was outstanding everything was done quickly and the treatment was on point and next day operation was successful. Every Nurse’s, Doctors and training students were amazing in 10F ward from 24-27 jan when I got discharged. Paul one of the nurse was very helpful",5
"The NHS was able to provide care for my disabled son during his dental procedure. This is what makes me proud. Everything was done with great care, from the nurses and doctors to the support staff to make it all easier.",5
"A few months ago I was admitted with abdominal pain which turned out to be appendicitis. Within 24 hours I had surgery to remove my appendix. I was given my own room, the staff were fantastic, attentive and caring, it was my first ever surgery and I honestly felt safe in their care. Some of these reviews are appalling and so disheartening. These people are there providing free health care to the British public, risking their own safety during the current pandemic. They need so much more praise than they’re given. Thank you to all the doctors, nurses, and surgeons that looked after me.",5
"Came in at 2am on a Wednesday morning. (After spending a few hours at the hospital a week before) we were in hospital till Saturday morning. We were well looked after. I am giving 5 stars not because it was perfect (its a hospital, not a hotel!) but because the care given was amazing!

We were assigned 6 different midwives  (Anne, Lisa, Bisi, Amy, Addy and Julie) and all were amazing in the end - some had different strengths and weaknesses but this is to be expected in a people business. Resourcing was excellent. The epidural was done twice, successfully both times as it didn't work as well the first time. Thanks to Daniel and Sarah and Priyad! Baby was delivered well and my partner's tear was fixed quickly and well. All of the doctors were also great (we just didn't catch their names as they were in high demand!).

Would come back here for baby 2!

Update: changing the review to 4 stars (from 5) to reflect our experience when we were moved upstairs to floor 8 (this was 38 hours into our stay by this stage, so we were very tired).
- 2 out of  3 scheduled checks were missed, I'm tempted to formally complain about this aspect, despite an overall positive experience.
We weren't told the result of the 1 scheduled check that did take place. (I guess it was fine otherwise they would have said?)
It wasn't communicated when our scheduled checks would end (only after we asked were we told that the checks had ended)

Being discharged also took ages. Baby and mom were completely fine, our baby's final check was done (this was done really well!). But at midday we were told they wanted to do an additional blood test (for no medically indicated, or at least communicated reason) - which could have been done way earlier that morning.

I get people are busy but the process was poor and communication bad. Also, the midwives were not friendly and whenever someone used their alarm to get help, it sounded so loudly that everyone in the ward could hear it.

This last part of our stay was 2/5 at best.",4
"After 6 months of trying to convince my GP to get me a referral, I went to my appointment and my doctor was lovely. She acted immediately on my case and booked me for a minor operation. The nursing team were so caring, the kept talking to me as I was in the operating room, one of them was holding my hand and they all gave me a hug at the end. I felt really relieved and was so grateful to them for being so sensitive and caring. It is always down to the person you come across but I couldn't recommend the team enough!",5
"Pretty poor experience compared to other A&Es I have been to. Came in because of a stabbing pain in my stomach. Saw three nurses and explained the same symptoms over and over again. Didn’t even get to see a doctor.

This was at 2am so it’s wasn’t busy but it still took two hours to see me. The nurse used documents from his personal yahoo mail and noted things down on the back of receipt which is just not professional.

I would avoid this hospital if I could. The issue is obviously not resolved but they still can’t tell me what is wrong but the nurses ‘think’ it is not serious so I can go home. Just go home and take painkillers. What a joke!

Badly managed hospital - avoid if you can.",2
"Been coming to Royal London Hospital for 8 months now for the prenatal care (ultrasound scans, blood tests, etc.). Experience been good so far until mid September.. as the receptionist changed on L8. Current lady is so rude!

Extremely disappointing to be facing such rudeness especially when you are in your last trimester and quite vulnerable. I wish NHS staff had a training on how not to be abusive towards patients and just be more friendly.",4
"We give a birth to our beautiful babe and was the first one.. they left us in a chair with water broke for hours and everyone there was so rude with us no one was helping
They just staying on phones and talk and laugh for everyone in hospital,",1
"0 stars for the labour department nurses who do not respect or listen to you at all. They seem grumpy all the time and frankly I find that disgusting. Even if you are crying for help, they ignore you. Perhaps they have seen too much of it and are fed up. But that’s not okay. Then quit. Find a different job. The doctors and midwives however were lovely. Everything you want and need when you’re in agony, and frightened to death.",2
"It is one of the best hospitals in London, I visit it regularly, once I had an emergency and also some family members as well as some friends who came here for various different reasons. So my review is 360 degree. The staff are very nice, attentive, kind and helpful; the hospital building is very clean in all the buildings and areas. The toilets are well looked after by the staff and attended regularly. I never seen or experienced any discriminations in this hospital and staff try to be as quick as possible, so people don't have to wait too long, especially at A&E.",5
My 1st visit here to A&E and Urgent care! I cannot fault the staff from start to finish. Thank you!,5
"I love our NHS however post covid lockdown it's become a shambles! I regrettably had to cancel a new day appointment.... took 25mins for me to drop from 11 to 12 in a queue...so I tried another option which was far worse. No on line facilities so you just have to stick it out.... if I had held on were talking estimate 3hrs hold. No wonder some folk give up & just miss their appointment, I will try again later as I do not want to be a burden on the system!",2
"The Urgent Care Clinic is horrible I’d give it a 0 if possible. I had to wait 5 hours, was seen for 10 minutes and then told to wait another hour. The attitude of the doctor that saw me was disgustingly rude and condescending. He was a smug character. Every single staff member (except one nurse lady) I encountered in that clinic left me feeling patronised. Like they were all trying to assert their dominance over me. Not a friendly environment at all. And this wasn’t the first time either I’ve felt like this in that clinic. I don’t feel comfortable going there anymore. There needs to be some sort of reformation in that clinic because It’s a toxic environment.",1
"My Dad use to work here and was always so proud. I know in A&E the worst thing is, you're definitely going to be there for a few hours waiting, and that's okay! But my mum went in twice over the weekend after calling 111, and both paramedics deciding she needs to go in, she got send straight back home early hours in the morning. Is it the space they need? We needed help and there wasn't none. Just that ""we have referred her to so and so, so wait for them to contact you"". The very kind and helpful nurses/doctors Jo and Cameron in zone B were so lovely, so this isn't a dig at their hard work! I just really needed more help from professionals to take care of her.",3
ANTENATAL department staff on the reception are rude. And you will NEVER be able to get a hold of them on the phone. I tried for 3 hrs in the end no apology just an attitude. I do NOT reccomend having ur baby here. UNPROFESSIONAL,1
"Very friendly and helpful staff, who are a credit to the hospital. The hospital itself is clean and well signposted. Waiting times can be quite long in A&E (though not all the time - this morning I was in and out in less than 1.5 hours for a fractured ankle), but what do people expect?",5
"The staff was patient with me and in 1h i was checked and good to go, considering as well the early morning and the others people around, they were efficient. The doctor that checked me after the nurse was especially kind and pragmatic at the same time. I would recommend this branch of A&E.",5
"The doctors and nurses are great. The overall organisation is total mess. They sending you back and forth multiple times, mixing up patients and their names, waiting times up to eleven hours..",3
"The operator on the ""help"" line shouted at me and was very rude, only because I was having connection problems and I couldn't hear him well. I was at the A&E yesterday due to some health complications, but unfortunately I had to leave without any medication as they didn't have any and was advised to go in today and collect it. As my health problem is causing me trouble with any physical movement, I wanted to confirm they had my medicine before traveling to the hospital. Unfortunately I was put through this operator that was very very rude to me, in fact no one has ever talked to me this way, and the only reason was the fact that my line connection wasn't good and I couldn't hear him well. Still in shock of how unprofessional he was, considering the fact that he speaks this way to an unwell patient that needed his guidance. WOW!",1
Im pregnant woman i came  in  delivery sute for my hedic i came in the morning 11 am and waiting still 10 pm only midwives seen me but no doctor came to observed.they just said to wait ...it is very worst thing in Royal London Hospital..they are not enogh stuff,1
The children's A and E were fantastic. Couldn't have wished for a better service. ❤,5
"Useless hospital, appalling service runned by their best ""professionals ""

Clapping for NHS? Booing for Bartshealth
They aren't eager to see you only because you had minor surgery elsewhere.
Yes I was told I should go there . Why didn't I choose surgery in RLH?.
I had one there and they've wasted three days to get it done . On first day they asked me to come and 6 hours later told We sorry our surgeon is abroad.
Second day 4 hours later they cancelled me again.

Other patient with bleeding forearm got same info.
Triage nurse rude, she was upset I didn't put my mask on. Ignorant to acknowledge I only have one hand free as other was plastered.
Eventually seen by SHO Ive complained about numbness and pins and needles in my fingers.
I also had temperature 38.3°C earlier that day.
After asking me to wait outside he consulted with plastic surgeon and told me its all fine.
No very keen to look at my wound, unwinded bandage and later rebandageg,  dropped it on on a floor and pick it up and continued.
I ve left and 20 sec I was called back .
Ohh sorry we need to take your  vitals
I went and had my Sats and NIBP taken.
Not bothered with my temperature.
Really appalling health care .
I wont be using Bartshealth from now on",1
"If I could choose a hospital to be cared in I would recommend The Royal London Hospital for me and my family. Clean and polite caring staff.
My son was in this hospital last week for a week and we had a really kind and positive experience
I found staff, at all levels amazing. Warm, welcoming, very informative, attentive and professional. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience.",5
"I hate to write this but had an awful experience which I cannot deny. My 8 months old son got very severe rashes on his face for which I was advised to visit RLH A and E. First I had to wait to be seen by a nurse who then did some checks and sent me to urgent care centre where again I had to wait for almost an hour to finally speak to a GP who must have not spent 2 seconds and declared this as chicken pox. We all as kids have had chickenpox and we know what it looks like and this rash no way looked like that. It's like no thoughts have been given for the diagnosis. After coming home , my sons condition became extremely serious and then I called again. The 111 call process is a different issue altogether however the whole.process repeated. Again I visited children centre where they had no clue that I was there in the morning. What notes do they keep writing if I had to repeat all of it all over again. Again I was sent to urgent care where I had to wait for 2 hours with a sick 8 months old in my arms and when I met the doc,he asked me why did I bother coming back! I mean seriously? A little guy has rashes all over , has fever and is in pain and I should sit at home and let it go away on it's own??? Seriously I wonder whether we should pay tax and get this service or pay lesser tax and go private? Because if we cant get a decent treatment then what's the point? The best part is yet to come....so I told him that his colleague thought its chicken pox and he just laughed it off. The diagnosis keeps changing with every nurse and every doctor. Felt like I had to waste my entire day to just get prescribed anti histamine.  Its non sense",2
The worst nurses I've ever encountered. Avoid at all costs.,1
The nurses on Floor 5 Ward 3E are the worst! They have no translation services and very discriminatory towards patients. I had to take my mum due to the medical negligence by nurses. Nurses are by far the worst I have witnessed.,1
"I have not had any update regarding my elderly sick mothers care since I left her in A&E until I contacted PALS. My mother was left crying in pain all night, she also informed me that she was not given any breakfast in the morning, no one attended her when she was crying in pain- no pain relief given and was left to take the wrong medications. Ward 11F is an absolute shambles, nurses are very rude and have no sympathy, empathy or compassion for patients and their family members. They use their threatening tactics of ending the calls to avoid answering questions. Nurse philis and nurse Samiha are extremely rude! I have asked numerous times for the ward manager to contact me, which I am still waiting to be called.",1
Worst place to have labour! Had so traumatic experience that if i have next kid i will be scared. Nurses are rude at baby delivery. And they don’t even know how to but needles on ur vain. Plus i needed to be there 6 more extra days between 2 other people with babies and didn’t get separate place. I literally didn’t remember how sunny day looks like bc there wasn’t any windows. Also if u want someone stay with u there over night there is just one chair and that’s all. Especially if u need rest and good vibes definitely it’s not the place. But kids operation side there is so lovely and friendly and 100% right people that side! :),1
This hospital never let me down for sure. I was treated Thursday night at the A&E department for a huge abscess by doctor Duncan . He was totally professional and patient as I was in a very bad situation. For me all the doctors and nurses there are heroes as they are taking care of us when we mostly need. We should show them more respect.,5
"Wonderful massive hospital, with great service and good uplifting views from the upper floors ;)",5
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOSPITAL 💉 YOU WILL BE LUCKY TO LEAVE ALIVE.  MIDAZOLAM AND MORPHINE IS LETHAL, MIDAZOLAM IS A LETHAL PAINFUL DEATH",1
My mum was in today at day surgery. She had a minor biopsy.  The staff were amazing.  So caring and considerate.  My mum was so nervous.  But you put her at ease. Round of applause to you all. From start to finish.  Thank you x,5
"Incompetent, prejudice, cancel appointments without notice and make there own appointments without your consent or availability.  Starts from 3 weeks upto to a few months to book an appointment. I hardly go doctors or hospital but when I do go as last resort, they make me feel more ill or feel worse. They change the history and scenario on your discharge papers to cover themselves when they have messed up. Doctors are not doctors. NHS is not the same compared to 15 years ago. On the day appointment. You get seen within 15mins of wait. Now its totally changed for the worse.",1
"I required stitches after a fall and had a great experience. Everyone was professional, friendly and made me feel in good hands. Thanks to all the staff and the ambulance crew.",5
"17/06/19
**Live review **

Ive walked into the A&E department at 13.30 as advised by the 111 adviser to check if my SPLEEN has ruptured . Its now 15.05 and i haven't yet been seen by a nurse consultant although I've seen people come in after me with hurt ankles and wrists seen before me ... i mean its understandable , a potential ruptured spleen isn't important 😐.  Due to the time I've sat her in the walking room i couldn't help but notice and speak to a few patients about how extremely rude the receptionist are ! Even if its your first time here and you don't really known where is where they will shout ! Get behind the red line on the right which if your new to the hospital you will most likely miss but yeah they will rudely tell you off ?? ( i replied back just as rude and put her in her place ) .
Hey
15.30 ( 2 hours in) i haven’t yet seen a consultant :) and the queue at the reception is about 20 people long because they only have one bay open
15.40 finally been processed and now my waiting begins in the xray waiting room .

16:00
The nurses who dealt with my case where very professional and to the point thank you . As for the whole reception team , you all need to get a grip . Not sure if id recommend this hospital because the nurses are good but receptionists aren’t . So its up to you i guess .",1
Do not come here!!! Extremely high waiting times and very rude doctors critising the choice to go to the urgent care treatment (waited for 3 hours) because its only for “trauma injuries” when a nurse in the same hospital directed us there following an initial check. Completely unprofessional and disgusting behaviour. The fact that this is the first google review I have ever been bothered to write says something and I would give 0 stars if i could.,1
"Amazing service but then not amazing service by this one particular black individual, he works in stepney way where A&E send you to get seen by a doctors. I think it’s the urgent treatment centre.

It’s only when I saw this black man who was suppose to give me treatment and make me feel better for being vulnerable makes my day very depressing and gives me the worst experience, ( it’s a bald black individual, around 5ft3, to 5ft4 inch tall standing, what google will provide me !!

The black individual slighty aggressive and condescending as a doctor you should not and speak to patients in a infuriating manner especially if they went through a nightmare their whole life base on the medical history yet this black individuals wants to get his thug barbaric attitude out. I don’t think he has the basic competency to even work at this NHS trust, his attitude towards patients is very disrespectful and disgraceful

Sort this out otherwise I will make a internal complaint and through local authorities about his behaviour and the way he behaves.

I went in the 3rd March at A&E, all stuff where nice, friendly, welcoming and compromising and willing to support me, I didn’t wait that long either despite A&E was busy but still manage to get seen yet likewise it’s only when I seen this one black particular man spiked by day. Rudely talking to me, up and all close and spitting on me, verbally aggressive and demanding me why I don’t know why I got pain as I went in for severe ankle pain with swallow foot. I couldn’t walk at all. I thought I broke my leg only to get told consume paracetamol and use ice pack but this wouldn’t truly and really heal me.

I could see his talking rhetorically nonsense so I make GP appointment turns out GP supplies me the correct anti inflammatory medicine for the particular issue I had, on a side note, it was a white male GP and few days later I can see I am recovering and can walk without being aided.

Many thanks to that GP for helping me and helping me get in my feet again. God bless him.",3
"I went to the urgent care centre today and it was very unprofessional. Firstly the woman at the front who checks blood pressure and temperature practically laughed in my face after telling her I suffer from ocd. After laughing she turned around and started using her phone. Secondly, it was very crowded which is understandable but the thermometer that was used in everyone’s ear did not get changed or sterilised once since I was there (which was for 1 and a half hours)  so the same thermometer was going in everyone’s ear, which could lead to an inaccurate reading and also is just unhygienic especially during this Covid period..
all in all, unprofessional.",2
I lost half of my body motricity and none of the two doctors take me seriously. No blood test - No brain scan or MRI. Worst part is the fact of none of two female doctors (A&E - Urgent Treatment Center Room 2) wanted to examine myself. All they asked me to do it's to go to your GP - the fact is because I loose my motricity twice this day my GP sent me to the Emergency.,1
"Terrible service, no communication between A&E services and UTC. Unfortunately I had to visit an Emergency services with my wife who is pregnant. The nursery saw my wife and sent her to go to the UTC (urgent treatment centre). After waiting of around 1 hour and a half we were seen by a GP. First comment was ""you should not have been sent here but instead to be done a scan"". Then we needed to go back to the A&E for a scan where supposedly we don't needed to wait again because the GP was going to right a statement and explain the situation. After going back and forward we had to register again at the main reception wait again for the same process and do the scan that was supposed to be done from the first time.",1
"I had a labour here in May 2020.
Very mixed impressions...
In the one hand, the night nurse was horrible, slow(too slow), instead of help she did what she thought was right, instead of doing what the pregnant women asked her to do. A strange doctor who made a fast scan(3 or 5 minutes!!) prior to stimulation of the labour, and said that the baby's position is ok for normal labour...That finally finished with the emergency Caesarian section after 15 hours of unsuccessful contractions with the stimulation(half of it with not working epidural anaesthesia!, blood pressure up to 200 and temperature about 39,4 before the operation)...
In the other hand, a great morning team of surgeon and nurses who made a CSection very fast and professional and I'm very thankful to them, that  I finally saw my daughter! This team said that the baby's position wasn't ok for a normal labour, and I  found it out only after the Csection...
Also I'd like to thanks to all the 8 ward(postnatal) team, who helped me and my daughter struggle with the infection after labour during the long week. They provided very good care.
I'm not sure  I'd like to come back here again if I have one more baby. However, not sure as well in other London's hospital, where are a lot of similar situations happens...",4
"Just had Ft with my sister.  She is going in for major cancer operation today. She is still sitting in a cold main entrance corridor 2hr after arriving.  At one time a patient would be taken to a pre op area, comfortable and reassuring.  She is left in the cold.  I’m more than angry and so disappointed.  Where has the human comforting face of this hospital gone.  Not all hospitals do this I know but this is my sister going in for cancer surgery, alone because of restrictions and frightened of the day ahead.  Sort this out Royal London. Don’t let this become normal.",1
"Transferred from another hospital for spinal surgery. Surgeons explained the procedure carefully to me in advance. So did the anesthetists, who were considerate calm and friendly throughout. Surgery went well. Ward 10e  staff were super nice and caring, rooms are spotless, spacious and bright, with spectacular views from the upper floors.
Sadly, post-op medical care was almost non-existent. Considering that the success of spinal surgery is inextricable linked to post op behavior and exercises, and that it wouldn't have taken much to instruct me, this seems unforgivably poor.",3
"(Original)
Very friendly and helpful staff, who are a credit to the hospital. The hospital itself is clean and well signposted. Waiting times can be quite long in A&E (though not all the time - this morning I was in and out in less than 1.5 hours for a fractured ankle), but what do people expect?",5
"Only the main entrance next to A&E (accessible from Whitechapel Road) is open for patients and booked appointments. No visitors allowed now.

Hospital is clean and number of people accessing the building is kept low.

You will be provided with a new surgical face mask even if you have your own. You will need more time for the checkin process which includes a few simple health questions, a new face mask, sanitize hands and have your temperature checked. This may take a while if there is a queue so give yourself time if you have an appointment. Queues are shorter though once in.",5
"I was in a long term vascular ward , most people left with a limb missing , all legs , feet , or toes at least  .
I was lucky nearly lost a leg but it did get saved (despite a keen to cut consultant)2 days b4 the OP to remove it!
I've not commenting to moan they saved my life , the a+e and emergency operations and icy are amazing but the ward I was on I discovered was1 noone  wanted because it was a ""hard work ward""  the permanent nurses were overworked but trying hard the agency nurses couldn't give a .... not all but many I was in for 3 months and had time to get to know that particular ward.",4
"Been waiting  1 hour  in the fracture clinic before the nurse called me to just tell  to get the X rays done.
For the first 20 min delay of my appointment nobody gave me updates untill I asked and a rude receptionist answered that I would be called, without giving explanation or maybe asking to the nurse to know what the problem was.
After 20 min more I asked again as no updated was given and the receptionist answer was( i said they will call why you keep asking)
When after maybe 10 min more the nurse came out the receptionist asked her about me cause I asked him 5 times when my turn would come, and the truth was, I asked him twice in a 40 min delay of my appointment.
Almost at 1 hour from my appointment I tried asking to the nurse which didn't give me any explanation.
As I said after 1 hour or more from my appointment I was sent to do my x rays.
After that I had to wait about 1 more hour before the doctor could see me for a visit that required 5 min.
Before seeing the doctor I asked the nurse what the problem was and she said that the doctor was busy with a patient, when I made her notice that there were no patients coming out from were I came in, she said that there were other exits.
I was seating on a chair exactly in front of the exit and entrance doors.
My visit lasted about 2 hours or more and I was the only one waiting that long, all other people who came after me were visited before I did.
If it was made clear from the beginning about the issue I would have been happy to wait or to reschedule the visit.",1
"Recently had a Hysterectomy here.had robotic Hysterectomy. Fantastic ,no pain afterwards and home next day with 6 tiny wounds across abdomen. Now 5 weeks since op and I feel great .Staff were all very kind and helpful and are very nice when you ho back for further appointments.",5
"One thing missing from staff, specially midwifes is a little bit of compassion. NHS is officially broken, need reset asap and accountability.",1
"Do you want to know something interesting?
Well the truth is, that we'll never know the real reviews of this hospital (at least not in this life) as the unlucky ones don't really get to say what their experience was like, because they stopped experiencing life...
Now enough of the morbidity, really this place is one of the best hospitals in the country can't fault them in anything, all the nurses, doctors, cleaners and even the porters are really nice and do their jobs the best that they can, saving peoples life's. Real superheroes!
God bless your souls!

RIP all the people that lost their life's at this hospital and my condolences to their families.",5
"Waiting time is ridiculous, not only because it's long but because they missinform you on the waiting time. Again I understand these are serious medical issues dealt with here, but for gods sake I waited two hours (that's roughly how long till someone would see me) just be told I need to wait two hours again. Again. Because. I appreciate they're busy but I could've gone home and waited on my bed in severe pain instead of lying on a ground by the hospital cause they don't have enough chairs and space to sit inside let alone social distance. This looks like a ghetto or a refugee camp, complete disgrace. Would have given zero if I could.",1
"Urgent treatment care is rubbish UTC. I waited there at night for hours. The people who were supposed to be seen before me weren't even called in. I had to leave because I was feeling more ill just sitting there. The A&E wasn't even busy. From what I see, it's not overstretched, seems like people cant be bothered to help. Probably get better service in a third world country. UK Dr's let things get really bad before they help diagnose.",1
Royal London hospital performed surgery on my son last week and did a brilliant job with care. he’s much better now and I’m so grateful,5
"If I could give less then one star I would. My sister has an ongoing problem and we had many visits at the A&E(we went 6 times in the last 7 months). The first time my sister was so bad she couldn't walk, they were very rude and didn't seem to care, the gynecologist was nowhere to be found, after a very long wait they finally found her and when she visited  my sister she was also very rude and her only objective was to get her to leave. the only thing the gyno did was to take 2 swabs which were never found. so she did nothing and send my sister home with no cure, no investigation, nothing.  The second time they did a surgery but then found out it wasn't what they thought it was. I'm very disappointed in NHS overall, its been7 month we are trying to figure out what is happening with my sister and they have no answers and also refused to do more investigations. The only thing they are giving her is antibiotics all over again for 7 times in 7 months. Ridiculous!!! Why are we paying taxes if we are left to die basically.",1
Terrible. We visit to London for a week and unfortunately my girlfriend has a problem with her health. We google and find this place first and decided to go around 1am. What a terrible service. Waiting time up to 6+ hours. Waiting area so uncomfortable. We didnt have thay long and go back to hotel. If you want to visit find another one,1
"My mum was rushed to hospital last week after having a stroke at the age of 84. The care and professionalism of the doctors was second to none. Excellent staff who worked at such speed that after a few hours she was speaking and moving as if nothing had happened. Lovely and clean, decent food and generally well looked after. She is now at home recovering well thanks to the royal London we still have our mum.",5
"Horrible experience. I was sent to a&e with an allergic reaction and it just seemed as if no one knew what they were talking about or what they was even doing. I find it worrying when health care professionals can’t confidently and clearly explain the reasoning behind the test and drugs they wanted to give me.

It’s gets much worse the more you read -Communication is poor, the nurse sent me to the wrong waiting area and my name wasn’t called for hours when I asked the doctor rudely replied just wait I’ll find out. She didn’t come back to me so I had to trace her up. She said you’re in the wrong waiting area go through those doors there said in the coldest manor.

I missed my name being called and the guy with long hair at reception refused to tell me how many people were in front of me but said it will be a long long wait. I asked him can I call for my results he said that would be fine.

It gets even worse - a few hours later in my bed i experience something called biphasic reaction which doctors told me nothing about this is basically where to allergic reaction  start up all over again. My throat closed up and I could barely breath once I regained my bearings I called the hospital for my results. The lady said she can’t give results over the phone. So who was lying the lady over the phone or the long hair young man at reception who advised me to leave the facility and call to get my results.

I hope it doesn’t take for someone to die of neglected care for this hospital to get it’s act together. This is people’s lives we’re talking about I never leave reviews but if you operate like that on a daily basis you must be killing people on a daily basis too.

Please correct this it’s literally a matter of life and death.",1
"Big Thanks to the Staff; my son was transferred here in a emergency from Queens hospital Romford. The surgical ward staff; nurses, surgeon team and consultants at Royals have been really good & informative. It did take some time until he got into the operation theater but that's due to the other emergencies before him. We were done and discharhed within 36hrs of admission.",4
"I have been dealing with the gynaecology team with my case and I was booked in for surgery in January but due to Covid my surgery was cancelled. I was then in pain and admitted to hospital in late April and while there, my surgery was escalated, however, they booked me on the wrong surgery(!!) and when I tried to switch my surgery to the correct procedure, I got sent in a loop around the hospital and nobody would help me. Everyone kept passing on responsibility and I could not get clarity on when I could get a date booked in for surgery. Utterly unhelpful, dismissive and can't believe that people are treated in this way. My health is declining and so is my mental health but I am no closer to understanding when my treatment will happen and we are approaching June. :(",1
"Dispicable treatment of patients, when you know how bad a person's tonsils are, removing them, you would think that they would give you antibiotics knowing you've needed them 5 times in 4 months. Ent department need more training",1
"I came here on a Sunday so it wasn’t busy at all which is why the service may have been quick. I was seen within an hour and the doctors were really friendly! Sadly it seems like all hospital receptionists are just a nightmare - they are so unfriendly. Again, I came here on a Sunday so wasn’t busy - can’t say what it’s like on busy days! Newham hospital was an absolute mess compared to this!",4
Quick and efficient service. Went through emergencies and left within 3 hours (relative short time for something not vital) we were also given a pair of clutches free of charge and they called my girlfriend to make sure she was alright after the viewing!,5
"My daughter was born here on 18.03.18. We had a good experience. She was breech and initially I was devastated I couldn't use the Barkantine or Lotus. I was booked for a planned c section but went into labour before the appointment. Even though I was only 1cm dilated, as there was some bleeding, I was admitted to triage and had my own room until I was 5cm dilated when they prepared me for theatre. This is where the hospital really excels. The spinal block was administered expertly and 20 mins later my daughter was delivered. She never left my sight after that.
We were wheeled to a recovery area and given a fantastic breakfast of coffee toast yogurt banana while the private room we requested was made ready. After a short delay  I was discharged to the private room and left to recover.  My husband had a large chair which reclined to a bed.
Within 36 hours we were discharged which I thought was great.
Thanks to all of the staff for taking such good care of us.",5
"Made us wait for 4 hours in urgent treatment centre to send us then to A&E for a scan, waited 3 hours then sent to scan and bought back because bloods wasn't done. Waited another 3 hours for bloods. They don't care, every step you have to wait a few hours. Appaling service, what good is paying tax? People in pain and they don't care. Disgusted.",1
"I was sent to royal London for an emergency mri, I was seen within a couple of hours, had the mri and then surgery 4 hours later. The surgeons were brilliant and the aftercare In recovery were amazing, so friendly too, thank you to the wonderful NHS",5
"One of the worst hospitals in the world. They have absolutely no interest in this skin problem I have had since 2015 when I put something on my skin I bought online.

As dermatologists you would think they would be interested in the biology of the skin and how a living organism could stay on the skin. You would think that they might have curiosity.

Doesn't exist here. They've called me a serial complainer but failed to treat me, gas-lighted me.",1
"Amazing hospital, who took good care of me.

Labiba, from the appointment office organised my surgery. She was very polite and understanding.

My surgeon the consultant obstetrician and all his surgical team did an excellent job. He performed the surgery with good care and skill, and set the right level of expectations.

Thank you to all the incredible staff who worked extremely hard to provide a good level of care and service. I was on 8C and received excellent care and attention from all the staff and nurses, nothing was any trouble for them.

Many thanks to the Royal London Hospital.

From,
Naz K.

"Today would have been my clinic appointment with the Gastro team. However I got a phone call to check in and see how I was doing, just as they would have been there. . I would like to say thank you to the team to show kindness support to me. I wish them all well and safe",5
My father with A movement disorder has been admitted after a couple of falls. The staff from a&e to ward have been generally excellent. It’s interesting to see how it works from the other side as someone who has worked in hospital. Key thing I noted was some kindness which goes a long way. Also speaking to patients and pitching conversations to the level they can understand. 4 stars due to the attitude of some staff - it amazes me why some people go into a caring profession when you the are far from caring. All the doctors have been excellent. Unfortunately there are no miracles for my father. All he is looking for is some kindness and support through difficult times.,4
"If you are really in emergency don't come here. Noone cares and all they care about is paperwork. The nurse who finally saw us when my partner could not breath and was basically passing out said to us that it is not an emergency because she isn't blue. She was rude, dismimissive and answered a private phonecall when seeing us. Disgraceful!",1
"I wanted to tell everyone about the excellent care I received from nurse "" BEATRIZ "" who was amazing and she was so attentive to all of my needs. I am extremely impressed with the level of care I received, the kindness and compassion from her. I've never experienced such care & alert whist being in hospital for 24 hours in A&E.  Thank you.",5
Went in for an ENT related issue. Best nurses and doctors work in this hospital. Imagine your nurses are so friendly that their vibes bring your resting heart rate back to normal.,5
"I trust the doctors and nurses at this hospital. They saved my life when I got pneumonia. Yes my original diagnosis was wrong, my discharge papers contained mistakes, and during my 6 days in the ward I didn’t sleep much because they took my blood pressure every 4 hours. But the food was really tasty and I got to have comfort food and Caribbean food. My linens were changed daily—yay clean. Plus, they still saved my life in the end.",4
"My first issue started because I am suffering with grade 2 spondylitis and was told that a nerve block injection would be the best treatment for me. I had the injection however it was incorrectly placed into my spine and has now caused a further severe pain where it was injected. So not only have I got the original pain I now have an additional pain both of which are seriously affecting my mobility. My second issue relates to attending A&E on the advice from my GP as I was suffering from severe headaches and pain inside my head for over a month. My GP sent me to A&E with a letter stating I need an urgent MRI. The nurse who I saw (yes you heard right I was only seen by a nurse not even a doctor) and they basically used the words you are fine you can go home and that you do not need a scan. I had to go back to my GP and they booked me in for a private MRI. The MRI showed that I have a brain tumour. Later on I was having seizures and was seriously ill for months and the treatment I received was in humane and quite frankly unacceptable. I complained to the hospital back in November 2018 and to date I still do not have any acknowledgement and response to my concerns. I am so deeply concerned for my treatment and care at this hospital that I have been left with no option but to remove my care and treatment from this hospital.

Visited Orthopaedics on September 2019",1
I would give 0 stars if I could. Worst service ever. The receptionists don't know a thing and they made me waist so much time. No communication. You should hire people with experience or at least give them a proper training. Even the doctor said they don't know nothing. What a shame! I'm never going back to this  hospital.,1
"Really unprofessional receptionist. I don't think I've ever encountered a kind and helpful one. Such a shame because the actual doctors and nurses are very kind and helpful. The reception team are absolutely awful especially in the ANC.
Updating 4 .months  later and its just as bad. I've never met such rude receptionist in any other place. Honestly such a joke. I would give 0 starts if possible.",1
"Was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes yesterday morning over the phone after a blood test. Was a massive shock. Told to go to hospital immediately due to HBA1C result showing risk of DKA. Arrived, was seen in 3 mins by a staff nurse and by a nurse within another 5 minutes. More bloods taken, very friendly and reassuring staff.

Within what felt like about 10 minutes more, was whisked up to a very nice clean room on a ward on the 11th floor by the staff nurse who saw me initially (felt very looked after). As he was leaving, an assistant handed me a menu and asked what I wanted for dinner that evening, and then someone brought me a sandwich.

The ward sister came and checked if I needed any pain medication and checked if I was feeling okay, and very quickly I was seen by a doctor who assessed me, then a little later by both him and an endocrinologist. Both very friendly and very empathetic to how shocking the day was for me.

After this, my food came (very tasty homestyle stuff - I had an omlette which tasted like it had just been made for me). Then got whisked down to x-ray to check something found during assessment. More tests (EKG) and then a final review by the doctor and I was allowed home; I think the doctor could tell as comfortable and cared for as I felt, going home without staying the night was what I was longing for. All in all I was there from about 13:45 - 20:30. Given the number of tests and data gathering they did I think that’s incredibly quick.

I’m sat in bed the morning after now, adjusting to the news of yesterday and can’t help but feel how well looked after I was by the staff at Royal London yesterday has made this much, much easier to bear. Thank you so much to all the staff from A&E including Romeo, the team on ward 11F, the porter who took me to xray, the brilliant registrar and endocrinologist and all the people behind the scenes. You’re all superstars.",5
"appointments kept changed and it is confusing that I received two letters sent out on the same day, one asking me to rebook the appointment, and the other says the appointment is confirmed.

there is not a booking reference being provided in any communication or letters, but when I called to change the appointment (as requested by the letters), I found out without a booking reference, an appointment cannot be changed (but I have the name, birthday etc to identify the case)

at the end, I was able to see the nurse/doctor, I have to say the experience there was good. It was just that the administration and scheduling was a chaos.",3
"My friend is there he has the best of care. I can't wait until he good enough to leave.
Thank you all for your prayers and support,and for the care he received from you all.",5
"A very disorganised and inconvenient service- particularly in the antenatal department. Knowing that the scan room we were in had problems with printing scan images, the staff did not let us know prior to our appointment. They didnt even mention us receiving an image, we had to ask and only then they told us the printer in that room was out of use and that we would have to wait until our next scan appointment in two months to be given an image. Very disheartening. Also waited for a very VERY long time for the blood test following the scan.",1
"If I could I would leave zero start. They don't deserved even 1 start. The service is horrible they inform at short notice regarding the appointments. Literally less than 10 hours. Also they didn't even respected the second appointment arrangement they set up. It was supposed to be an appointment over the phone instead of face to face and no one even bother calling me.....I spend 2 hours trying to reach the person  ( I can't call this person """""""" professional """""""""") with who I was supposed to have the appointment but the secretary service is so rude and unskilled. I'm speaking about one operator that transferts your phone call to the proper department. They need to get rid of her and get someone competent and willing to do her job. Also the response I've  got regarding my appointment is ""sometimes they can call you 3 hours after the time initially set up...keep you phone next to you..... Also it is possible that they will call you tomorrow."" . And I 'm sure that if you miss the call even if it is the day after, they will not hesitate to blame you for that ! People have a live and they work. So if an appointment is booked at a certain time they are going to make arrangement to attend it. I took one afternoon off from my job for this appointment and people treat you like that..... it is unbelievable. It is unprofessional and completely disrespectful. Run away from them they are providing such a poor service ....... it is so disappointing ! What a poor service they are offering.",1
"Had an appointment yesterday at 2.30pm in the DERMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT. I made it there by 2.10pm, they got my details and asked me to wait. 10 minutes later, a nurse guided me into a room to tell me my doctor wasn't in and they had none available so I couldn't be seen, after a month waiting for this appointment. They just said that somebody at some point will call me and give me a new appointment. They never called earlier to inform me or even give me a new appointment there and then. No help or advice was given by any of the staff. Now I've had to book a new appointment for myself, cause they haven't called, my next appointment is in 3 months.",1
I’d like to say a big THANK YOU to EVERYONE who works at the Day Surgery Unit on Floor 3. I’m recovering from a general anaesthetic surgery and all the staff were extremely friendly and professional. Thank you all.,5
"Really slow service even though the hospital was empty, first doctor told me to continue to smoke, while i had tachycardia and sent me home telling me to drink water.
Came 5 times in total and nothing have been done to help even though i passed out 2 times due to intense panic attacks. All the workers of the hospital have been really rude for no reasons every time i went there. I am sure that many people died from these types of services. I think it's better to shut down this hospital instead of putting people lives in danger by wasting their time and energy while they have serious diseases, heart problems in my case... This is the worst medical service i've ever seen in my life and if I could i would sue this hospital for putting people lives in danger. Please do not work there if your intentions aren't the ones of a caring hospital worker. The only people that were good are the people checking for coronavirus symptoms at the entrance. From the receptionists to the medical team , this is a complete waste of money in salaries for the government.",1
"UTC is awful. They only refer you to your GP or make you wait for 4h to then send you back to A&E. They don’t want to diagnose you or would put the effort in, but just see the patient as a problem to get rid off and move on. “You need to see your GP.” They don’t do any tests in there and if they do je ready to wait 12h.",1
"I have been here in the emergency waiting area for morethan 3 hours and am still waiting. God knows when am going to be seen. I am in so bad pain. The receptionists are all rude and argumentative. The receptionist told me everyone in pain so what, like its a joke for her. This stressed me more than even my pain. Am in so bad pain and now i am emotional stress because of the receptionists. I have seen the doctors in the high way chatting almost for 30 minutes laughing while we here waiting. 1 doctor comes every 30 minutes to call for 1 patient. NHS should send an announced inspector to see how they run this hospital here. Staffs with out sympathy and rude.",1
"On the whole, the care here is excellent. We had a difficult ride before and after our baby was born and the staff were amazingly supportive and the treatment first class throughout every stage and appointment, especially the antenatal and neonatal teams. The key disappointment was the midwives on the post natal birth ward who were generally rude and uncaring which was a bit rubbish considering our baby wasn't even with us.",4
"I've been here about 10 times for A&E and they are pretty good, wait times not that bad normally. Last week I went with a mini stroke and there was a huge wait for treatment, people waiting up to 10 hours for a bed if they were to be admitted. Shocking. My attack was a TIA (transient) so I decided to discharge myself. Staff were not pleased and recommended I stayed; one nurse was very short with me and a little aggressive. If they're under pressure being aggressive doesn't help anyone.",4
"[VIP TREATMENT - Thank you] Pure praise for the NHS 111 team, the 111 doctor who referred me for a 2:00hrs appt here (yes a 2:00am appt! I even had a choice of a 2:00hrs or 2:20hrs slot), the receptionist and the nurses and consultants who saw me there.  When I arrived in reception at 2:00hrs, I received a phone call on my mobile asking my whereabouts and I explained, I'm in reception however it turns out it was the wrong reception area. I felt like I was VIP having an A&E appt slot, inquiring my location because they were expecting me and hadn't been notified that I'd arrived therefore sent out a 'search party call'. I was seen by a Stage1 nurse within 10mins of sitting down in the waiting area. The 4 nurses  and consultants were 100% in their duties and I left at 5:45hrs very re-assured that I had had a thorough examination where no stone was left unturned in getting to the bottom of the reason for my sudden symptoms and the diagnosis conclusion.   ********Very grateful for the dedicated  NHS staff at London hospital in Whitechapel who saw me on Sun 7 Mar2021 Pure praise!********",5
"Love, love, love this hospital. They offer great support and assistance. I dont know how my husband would be living without them.",5
"Extremely disappointed with the service I received this morning. The receptionist was very rude and made comments about other patients in front of me. She rolled her eyes and kept remarking on how 'tired of this' she was. Immediately made me feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome.

I didn't have to wait long before seeing a nurse which was good. The nurse was also extremely rude and sarcastic. He made a number of comments that made me feel pathetic for coming in. I have had bad diarrhoea for 7 days now along with other symptoms and the nurse had no time for me. He didn't listen to the symptoms I had and told me that I shouldn't have gone in to the A&E. He laughed at me when I told him why I came in. I left after about 2mins.

So disappointed and upset with the service I received. Almost in tears by the end of it. Will definitely not return to this hospital if I can avoid it.",1
"The Hospital was very clean and staff friendliness was very good. Went A&E with symptoms of a previous problem. When i saw a surgeon they didn't want to listen to what the problem was but suggest their own theory even though I had experienced the exact problem before. Had to fight so hard to get the surgeon to listen to me. I was sent home to return in the morning. The surgeon had talked to her surgeon colleagues and they were abviously on her side as where trying to convince me of her case even though I knew what was wrong with me. I managed to get the checks i asked for . The check they didnt want to do. The anaesthetic consultancy was brilliant and she listened and explained things very well. She answered all quires I had. I had the surgery in the end and everything had been exactly as I said. The surgeon's that operated on me done an excellent job. Was in great comfort coming out of surgery as well. 5 star rating.  If i had not stuck my ground, I would not have had the surgical procedure I needed. I would have been getting the wrong treatment and my condition getting worse and causing me great pain and discomfort. Was very disappointed with the way I was consulted on both occasion. But an impressive looking hospital. Would be a five star rating if consultancy was good but it wasn't for me and is the most important thing in a hospital for me. It doesn't matter how clean or friendly the staff are if patients get the wrong diagnosis. They won't get the right medical care they need.",2
Felt like I had to make a review because I genuinely believe the nurse in the A+E dept. was not bothered to do her job and i felt that she was passive aggressive towards me. It was my first time attending A+E when I had a really bad experience. Had a nurse who assessed me. She didn't even say hello just sat there waiting for me to explain. Felt she was dismissive about my pelvic pain and writing it off as just that I might be 'ovulating'. I think I know the symptoms were unusual bcos as a women we ovulate every month but this pain was different that I knew it was something else. She could have at least given me a urine bottle to out-rule any kind of infection but she didn't. The Nurse then took my BP and didn't say a word and just told me to wait for a GP to call me in. I don't write reviews like this but I understand she may have had a bad day and I understand NHS is at a strain but felt she was unprofessional and I felt like I was a burden and wasting her time. What a disgusting service.,2
"I received excellent treatment in A&E. I waited less than 30 mins, this was a Sunday morning 9am. The nurse was very kind and took his time doing the tests and making recommendations for what I should do to get better. I felt relieved to get such empathetic care.",5
Really appreciate the friendly and amazing service towards my partner the wait was long in the labour ward but they did the best they can in the shortest amount of time bless. The NHS staff for helping us in our hard time and helping the nation heal,5
"Being coming to The Royal London Hospital for over ten years. It was opened as a new building around 2010. As a clean modern big site , with London helicopter base on the roof. Most of staff are polite and friendly towards patients having treatments.",4
Terrible. Spent two hours at urgent care waiting room just to be told that the doctor won't see me because the symptoms are not severe enough. They said they booked me an appointment with a GP out of hours. When I got there they didn't want to admit me because they didn't get any information about booking from a hospital. Went back to the hospital as my condition got much worse in the time I spend driving around and waiting and was told that no one will speak to me because they don't admit people to urgent care twice in the same day and I've already been here before. Everyone there acts like you're lucky that they even talk to you.,1
"Horrible experience with my 1 year old daughter. Was made to wait by urgent care 4 hours with her in the heat, after having arrived by ambulance. Then 5 more hours back in the pediatric A&E. Please do not bring your child here.",1
"I came to visit my father on the ward today. Ismahan (nurse) on ward 9 North today was very respectful, caring and reassuring towards my father. My father was anxious and worried about being in the hospital.

Ismahan managed to reassure him, and he felt a lot better. This is an excellent example of the difference care, compassion, and good communication can make towards a patient whilst in hospital.

Please send Ismahan my thanks.",5

"Went in was diagnosed with liver problem. First night I was up on ward I was talking too two elderly patients we were only ones on ward had some nurse give us attitude. I told her don’t talk to me that way. Train your staff properly to have social skills. African ones all attitude. The consultant was good but his team need to learn how to communicate properly and not treat you like your stupid they can be patronising the way they speak to you. I said to them I have a brain and all because I am working class don’t look down your nose. All snotty with posh accents.

Now we come to the care and cock ups kept starving all day for a procedure that never happened my boyfriend had to ask was told we knew two hours ago. I was angry and annoyed lack of communication skills again they seem to think patients are stupid.

I had a procedure yesterday I opened my notes there was someone else’s in there as well as mine how incompetent is that. Same day the same nurse tried to give me someone else’s injection. She should not be allowed to work here again.

I watched similar instances going on with other patients.

Also yesterday one nurse on duty so ward was not covered properly what a joke that is plus could cost lives.

Why can’t you run this hospital properly it’s a joke short staffed and rude nurses not all but some. Condescending junior doctors and another thing students turning up at your bed during  visiting times to want to examine you so rude.

My friend is on the panel she observed lots while visiting me.

To be honest I have to come back here but wish I did not is this what my money is paying for incompetence on a big scale and to be treated like I am some idiot.",1
By far the best nhs hospital I’ve been to. Had a letter from my private doctor to show a&e and only waited for 20mins. I was then admitted and experienced good health care for 2 weeks. I was diagnosed and and being treated by the first week. I now have appointments every month to monitor my illness. Very pleased with the service.,4
"Went to the hospital for a head injury, simply came in to get further guidance as my condition worsened and nhs 111 recommended me to. I’ve never dealt with this type of injury before so as I was very concerned myself and I had pushed myself to come in.
Went to this Dr called DR GEMMA EYRES at the urgent care centre after waiting a while, she called my name once, did not greet me and give me any eye contact, she just held the door for me with her back faced towards me and then just walked and I just followed her to the room. Honest to God I knew she was going to be a miserable fish, her attitude towards me was so cold as I came into the room and was so distant she just told me to sit down and then her first question was “do you have a social worker?” I said that I didn’t but I knew from then that she wasn’t going to be helpful.
She then asked me why I am out at 3am as I am 10wks pregnant and I looked her and had to ask if she was ok?
1, I stated that I was leaving a restaurant with family (I mentioned that I don’t drink) 2,  I’m not heavily pregnant. 3, Im almost 30!
She took a quick feel of my head and did not even feel the area where there was a lump and just took off her gloves and said that it’s normal and to expect headaches etc.  She then proceeded to say that she is  concerned for the babies welfare so she has to make a referral to children’s social services for this FETUS as if I’m underage, binge drinking, going out heavily pregnant and purposely getting into accidents.
I don’t know what was wrong with her but she is clearly suffering in her life for her to treat people like this, bc I only came in to get my head injury checked out and not ambushed.
Luckily my doctor called me as I was leaving out the room and reassured me that I would be fine with regards to my condition and to not worry about this referral, I’ve spoken to two other doctors now about this head injury and they weren’t so rude and disrespectful nor we’re they concerned about the pregnancy.
Dr Gemma is just unprofessional, unaccommodating and just unhelpful she honestly wasted her years studying in medical bc she isn’t going to get far in this field with that miserable attitude. Poor lady is making the whole department look rubbish. Dr Gemma from the urgent care centre, you are a sad woman! Just remember that social services referrals last a couple days but google reviews stay, hopefully you’ll learn to treat future patients with respect. Shame on you!",1
"It takes a long time before they see your child in children's A&E, but you can expect that given the pressures on NHS and the understandable priority for more serious cases.  But he worst thing is that they are completely unorganized and lack any motivation to be quick.  Extremely slow.  After waiting for over an hour, we were seen b doctor who recommended antibiotics.  It then took over another hour to actually get those in our hands despite reminding.",1
"I had a four day stay recently and was very impressed by this excellent hospital. Mainly it was the staff, who were attentive, caring, friendly and fun and nothing was too much trouble for them. And that was not just the nursing staff but this extended to the catering and cleaning staff, all of whom were courteous, spoke very good English (there were several nations represented here) and hard working. Often hospitals are criticised for lack of cleanliness and bad food, neither of which applied to the ward I was on which was 3D. You had a choice of food and when it arrived it was hot and tasty - honest!
I now attend outpatients, where once again, I am having very good treatment. Never rushed or hurried, though the department is very busy, the staff have time for you. This is why I am very happy to award 5 stars.",5
"Attended Children A+E on the 12/3/2020 with my teenage daughter who had an accident while playing netball in school. She was seen by two different doctors who are unable to interpret the X-ray report and said their consultant will look at it the following day and give me a call to see if she needs fracture clinic attendance which I’m still waiting to receive. One of the doctor who was an orthopaedic doctor  was unable to conclude on the X-ray and said they need to apply panel knee splint for support. No instructions whatsoever was given on how long to leave it for or what precautions to take. The support worker that came in to apply it was asked for leaflet and went out to ask the nurse in charge who in turn told us there’re no leaflets to give and we should just go home and will be contacted. We practically have to beg for Ibuprofen to be given. My daughter was in a very bad pain, no access to wheelchair, she has to struggle to walk in pain from the waiting room to a long corridor to the X-ray when we asked the nurse for a wheelchair she said not available. Inequality in NHS is becoming more and visible and this need to be taken seriously. I work for NHS and I believe the care my daughter received on this occasion is unacceptable, kindness goes a long way. If there’re minus 0 rating I would have given it due to my experience.",1
"I gave birth 3 weeks ago at the Royal London hospital and I was really disappointed of how wrong it went. All the antenatal appointments were good so I was confident of giving birth there. I was taken care of really quick but from the moment I was moved to the Labour room things went wrong. The midwife tried to find my vein to put the epidural catheter and after 3 painful trials she handed over to the anesthesist to do it. The anesthesist managed to put the catheter in one go but needed 2 trials to find the spot in my spine for the epidural. Afterwards i was in doubt of the level of competency of the staff there which got worse as the epidural didn't work properly. The anesthesy only went into my legs but I could feel all the contractions and as the epidural slowed down the contractions I had drips to increase their intensity which put me in an indescribable pain. I complained to the midwife, the anesthesist and other staff coming in and out of the room but no-one did anything about it apart from increasing the dosage which clearly didn't work. I was about 9 cm dilated feeling the intense pain when a second anesthesist came and realised I was put in the wrong position. Once I have been put in a laying down position the epidural finally worked and from then the delivery was pain free. Only Jamie the day shift midwife and the second anesthesist were clued.
Once baby delivered we've been moved room but as I couldn't pass my urine and walk I started to feel dizzy as the staff handled me too quickly. I entered a delirious state and fainted. My tension went down to 30, my husband thought that this was it for me. I have been moved back to the Labour room to be monitored and dripped. After few hours I finally woke up in a stable state.
We spend 3 more days in a delivery suite for 220 per night but the service was quite rough.",2
Worst hospital I have visited and my local is Newham that says a lot,1
"Such poor standard of everything!! A&E staff didn't seem to care was more like a conveyor belt to them one in one out! if you approached a doctor or nurse to ask what is happening after being left in the corridor for almost 8hours with a iv drip in sorry I'm busy right now (walking up and down like a lost puppy most of them).
Patient is a child only just 16 and taken to an adult ward where he was forgotten!!! Nurses didn't seem to know anything about him when we got to the room is was NOT even cleaned dirty linen, syringes and the last patients gone off oranges NOT TO FORGET the suction bag FULL of last patients nastiness left and not emptied out. As a nurse myself who worked in the NHS this is VERY POOR STANDARD of care and cleanliness!
Also to note they wanted my nephew to go home the night after being taken to emergency surgery and blood transfusion clearly seeing he isn't stable enough to even get up. His room after the emergency was left in a tip and blood stained forceps opened up swabs and bags of saline left on table side over night!
Yes you have a nice new building but your duty of care and manners are poor! I would not recommend anyone to go there!",1
"On two occasions now this hospital has been a disappointment. My father who is 80 years old and has been quite poorly was due to have a procedure on Tuesday, he was made to come in on the Monday to assure he had a bed. The procedure got cancelled but was to stay overnight to be assessed. On Wednesday morning he was seen by a Dr who wanted to prescribe meds then discharged, my elderly father who was well in himself was desperate to get home, but had to wait all day for a prescription and hospital transport to get home, he eventually got home at 9pm in time for him to prepare his dialysis for that night. This whole episode was a complete joke, when contacting the hospital by all family members we were greeted by rude, uncaring staff who led us astray with lies, we could have been able to assist but wasn,t in a position to because we weren't told any facts. This cause a lot of stress and disruption. My father was in ward 9E and although some members of staff were lovely to him, Marion the nurse in charge of him was not. I spoke to her on one occasion and was disgusted with her attitude. My father has vowed never to return. What a waste of 3 days with nothing really accomplished and a waste of resources. We will be making a formal complaint.",1
"One if the worst accident and emergency department, wherever for any reason I visited they always send me to urgent care whare I had to wait 5 hours.

I came for fracture but they didn't bother to x-ray.  After 6 weeks, they have dome x-ray and informing that I had two fracture on my leg .",1
"My daughter has just been to the urgent care unit from A&E as a 2x2 piece of wood hit her falling from some cowboys scaffolding. She didn't see any doctors, only a very lazy so called nurse who couldn't be bothered, not even an x-ray. Maybe it was because my daughter took him away from doing their Tiktok dancing videos. Also, the government state that the hospitals are overrun but there was only 3 other people in there, I was expecting for my daughter to have to clamber all over the dead bodies piling high.",1
"It has been half an hour since I had my foot op
The staff are really kind and understanding Dr's and Nurses deserve more credit they get.

!UPDATE!
I had another foot op about 9 months ago and the staff were amazing yet again! I love this hospital and if I need to have any other procedures done I will definatley choose this hospital.",5
My son stayed in this hospital for 5 days.  Is still under the care of specialists.  All doctors are very professional and the nurses are very kind and helpful.  Thank you very much to the children's hospital ward.  He only deducts the star for food :-).  not good at all,4
"Writing this review having just been discharged from this hospital after emergency surgery that saved my life.

The trauma/ gynae team at this hospital are the some of the most skilled, tactful, caring, truly amazing set of clinicians you will ever come across.

The facilities etc are great but the TEAM is what makes this place what it is, worth their weight in gold, simply cannot put into words how incredible they were

THANK YOU RLH

xxx",5
"The medical staff on ward 7d are amazing. They were very professional, very caring and I really appreciate the care they gave to my son... not very happy though with the ward host staff especially the one that serves breakfast and lunch I found she was quite rude with the way she spoke to me and the food was cold especially the toast in the morning ..",3
I stayed here for a week when after falling ill with meningitis. The nurses and doctors were great. The hospital is very clean and modern and I had my own private room with me suite. I was well looked after and the food was surprisingly really tasty. Would definitely recommend.,5
"Was seen extremely quickly in a&e but what a disappointing service. The nurse made me feel bad for seeing me quickly by telling me it was a 4 hour wait, even though i waited patiently to be seen. On top of that didn't check me for what i went there for in the first place and sent me on my way. Had to go to another a&e where the doctor checked me and prescribed me what i needed. Would never recommend anyone to go here even if they needed a hospital ASAP. Would rather them travel somewhere else. What a disgrace.",1
"Big shout out to the nurses and doctors at the Royal London Hospital!!

My first time here and I was dreading it but i was pleasantly surprised!! They were very quick to see me and very efficient in handing me over from team to team! My night nurses Mary and Sylvia were ANGELS! They woke me up with the best smiles and jokes! Really professional yet friendly service from top to bottom!.

Only two comments:
1) The restaurant on the 5th floor serves AMAZING HEALTHY FOOD! I love it  and wouldn't mind coming over to eat that on a Sunday afternoon...

2) The reception system at the entrance of the A&E might be better off with a ticket system to replace the usual standing as this was a bit of a pain.

All the same, I've had a brilliant 2 days here! Thank you everyone!",5
The emergency team is the worst i have encounter. Waited for over 2 hours so the “doctor” can tell me to just wait for a pharmacy to open and that I should have the pain until then. I arrived at the hospital at 2am left almost at 5am. Pathetic very pathetic,1
"Avoid the Orthopedic department at all cost! The waiting time is 2 hours. The doctor has to see 40 patients in 1 day when he is coming to the hospital only on Friday. Medical negligence- that's what I experience there. Look for your rights people! If you are not happy with the service, make a formal complaints to NHS.",1
"I understand the situation of other patient in the ER but I think the ER lost its purpose by having to wait for more than 3 hours as the pain was unbearable. I kept mentioning my disease and pain and the least they could have done is give me something to hold the pain until the doctor can have more time for me. In General, I'm a tourist and it's a shame to have this lack of medical attention in one of the top countries in medicine.",1
"i went to the urgent treatment centre and they told me that the waiting time is around 7-9 hours.
this is unacceptable, we are paying taxes for something. health is not a joke",1
"Amazing doctors, horrible administration. Can never get through by phone, calls are ignored or dropped. Can’t change appointments by phone because of that. Test results getting lost. Many people (not doctors, but nurses and receptionists) all walking around, all having time to have a chat with colleagues, but pretending that they are super busy. Management needs to step up and organize this mess.",3
"Brilliant as ever last week when I was ill. It's a privilege to receive free health care from such talented and caring people.

Save the NHS.

Do not let Government deliberately defund and sell off services to the private sector.

Pay all of our hospital staff more, every last one of them",5
"I had neck surgery at the Royal London Hospital. The doctors and staff were competent, helpful and kind. I was treated with compassion and care. There were some disgruntled and rude patients but even they were dealt with very politely. The equipment is modern and the whole hospital is very well run.",5
"I have been a patient under the Barts Trust since 2007. There have been up and downs over those years, but in general I am so grateful for their (Barts Hospital and The Royal London Hospital) continued care.

I have become a regular patient again in the beginning of 2020 (with 2 stays in the Neurological wards 12E and 12F) and again in 2021 (both wards). I can honestly say my experience with all staff at both hospital has been exemplary during this difficult (Covid) period. From my neurosurgeon Ms McKenna and her medical team of doctors, nurses and admin support. This applies to both the x-ray teams at both Barts and the Royal London (had numerous MRI scans over the last 18 months).  On my 3 visits to The Royal London wards 12E and 12F, I have found the nursing and care staff to be so helpful and supportive.

I can't praise the medical care I have received from both these two hospitals highly enough. This is a BIG thank you for all the NHS personnel who have got involved in my care over the years. Thank You all so much.",5
Went there to the A&E two days ago. Had to wait 7 hours for a doctor and a bed. No one explained anything to me or my sister about why we had to wait that long and the reason. I love the NHS but the waiting times are horrible at RLH. A&E nurse in charge was rude and inconsiderate I understand they are busy at times but it doesn't hurt to speak to the patient and explain bed issues. We needed help and rang the bell so the nurse would come but the bell rang for 5 mins till we gave up and got up to complain and the nurse in charge answer was that she was the only nurse here which is unacceptable! God forbid something happened and we really needed their help it doesn't hurt if a doctor came in if they were short on nurses.,1
"Horrible.. I’m having condition for almost 6 months non of the doctors gave me help , non of them gave me treatment… I needed to pay for private clinic… In the end I need to come back to my home country because private doctor say that all these stuff needs to be done by nhs but I believe this is how they care about our health… Taxes is gonna be raised for them… ridiculous… at least people in this building is not worth it… One lady who works in reception is so horribly rude she shouldn’t be working with customers service at all! She was laughing of me straight to the phone! I would like to report all these people and how much help they gave me but unfortunately I can’t I the worst thing is that I’m paying my taxes to make sure that they will get paid…",1
"I went for the 3 time in the emergency, the first time they found blood in my urine and sent me home with a paracetamol and antibiotic prescription. I had all the medicine and still was in a severe pain, I came back and to the second time They took 5 hours and Was 2 am when I couldn’t stand there anymore and went home.
Went to my gp and the doctor said that to do a CT exam Only the emergency could do and written a latter. When I went to the emergency again with the letter, the recepcionist refused to check the letter and asked me to fill a former saying that I was aware that I could be charge to use the NHS.
I am a uk resident, family member of a European citizen and I living lawfully and showed her. Even like that she screamed on me , saying I should feel the former properly with my address from outside the UK.
I am with a kidneys severe pain and feeling really sick and they refused to give the properly treatment .
Very rude staff . Extremely  up setting",1
"I am extremely happy with the treatment from their A&E department. The team of receptionists, nurses and doctors were very professional, highly efficient, polite and caring. I experienced no waiting time on Sunday.",5
"My husband was brought in 10 days ago with serious injuries. Due to covid I have not been allowed near the hospital which I completely understand. However, during the last 10 days I have not received one phone call from the hospital, not from A&E, not from the trauma ward, not from patient liaison, nothing from anyone! Even Pals gave up trying to find someone to call me after they were repeatedly told that someone would, but no one did!  I was given one contact number for friends and family liaison and one for the air ambulance when he was taken away. No one has ever answered either phone! I wasn’t told where he was, what his injury was, when he was having surgery, what surgery he was having or that he was out of surgery, how the operation went, or how he was recovering, or infact if he was even still alive, nothing!! I called every single department and no one knew of him, and after 3 days of calling solidly found out he was registered under the code name ‘Victor Charlie’ despite all the identification documents and next of kin being filled in for the air ambulance, I have literally gone out of my mind with worry and have been sick with the stress. Yes I understand staff are busy (however according to my husband they never look too busy, plenty of time for fun) but now there are no friends and family in the hospital taking up doctors and nurses precious time it would be good practice to maybe allocate one phone call a day or a week to family of very sick people to let them know how there loved one is and more importantly confirm if they are alive or dead. There also seems to be issue with the care aswell as the communication, now my husband can speak he tells me he waited 34 hours with a nasty open fracture of the femur in agony waiting for surgery, being told frequently ‘you will be going down within the hour’ that went on for 34 hours, not good when you have experienced major trauma to have such a further traumatic wait with endless misleading information. Then yesterday at 9am he was told he could go home, very exciting and we were all on a high that we get to see each other after 10 days of hell, but he then waited over 12 hours for his medicine to come from the pharmacy by which point it was 9.30pm and patient transport had no drivers to bring him home. He can’t get in the car due to his injuries so now 24 hours after he was told he could go home he is still sitting there ready to go home, taking up a bed the nurses said was ‘like gold dust’! I am very thankful for the surgeon who put my husband back together again and will be eternally grateful, however I don’t know their name because I was never communicated with and my husband was uncontious! So in summary it seems there are some amazing doctors and nurses at the hospital who put people back together and deal with major trauma on a daily basis, however the communication and after care seem terribly run by the ward managers with no organisation and not a lot of humanity!",1
Don’t go! My mother went to the A&E with severe pain (she has gallstones) the nurse and do teor completely neglected and ignored her and sent her back home. The same night I went to the A&E hospital where she was then admitted with a serious infection caused by the stones!,1
"Patients with leaking Colon are not operated on time and sepsis is killing the patients with in mounths !
My father was left out with leaking Colon for 5 days and then on the  5th day operated . It was too late the sepsis has  taken his tour ! Through the capillaries in to the veins. He developed fever ,and brain haemorrhage and then organ failure. My father died on saturday the 21st. Because of negligence in Royal London Hospital my father is no longer with us !",1
"Midwives are dismissive of patients , rude, and uncaring.....appointments are rushed and any problems or concerns dismissed or not reported. My partner went to her appointment told the midwife she was experiencing migraines (that won't go away) , nausea,  fatigue, & dizziness...was offered iron tablets ...and in patient notes it was noted ""Feels generally well""  ....We fear its actually pre-eclampsia and when we suggested that to them they dismissed it...the migraines and other symptoms still haven't lifted when my partner called to check  on her test results she was told not to come in as she might have covid..although she has no symptoms of covid....the lack of concern for patient welfare is disgusting , and we will be putting in a formal complaint with council and the ombudsman..If you were considering this hospital for  birth I would highly suggest you don't....in fact avoid at all cost.

I HAVE TO ADMIT...DURING BIRTH
they came through with the most amazing care and service...me and my partner felt completely safe and insured in their hands ..the labour ward doesn't leave anyting to chance...its absolutely amazing and even with a complicated birth they made us feel completely in control ..I owe the staff here a massive apology cause when it came to it they came through",5
The rudest reception staff (ENT department) I have ever encountered. I have been ringing up for nearly a week now and the phone just rings and rings from morning until night. I have sent multiple emails with no response. Today someone finally answered the phone then put it back down again. Absolutely disgusting behavior considering I have been waiting for an appointment for over 3 months now and have no letter or way of contacting the hospital. Even when I have been to the hospital before the reception staff at this department are rude and dismissive of the patients. Just like to have a chat between themselves. I would be happy to see them lose their job as they are totally ungrateful of the position and maybe employ someone who can take the role more seriously. Will take the matter further until something is done.,1
"One of the worst hospitals I’ve ever been to. I’m a few weeks pregnant and rang 111 before coming into the hospital with horrendous pain in my belly. Checked in at the reception who seemed more concerned with a conversation with her friend, then told me to sit down and wait to be seen. I waited for 3 hours without being seen by anyone. I had people coming in after me with clearly very minor issues being seen before me. I asked the receptionist how many people were in front of me and she told me I had an hour wait which wasn’t what I asked. I got up again an hour later to ask again and her friend told her to tell me that I was next without checking who I was so basically to shut up me. The first time I came to this a&e I was suffering an allergic reaction and the dr told me I need to go home and take paracetamol. I also over heard a woman complaining because they left a  cannula in her arm! I will never come back to this hospital even though it’s local to me. Not only are the staff absolutely disgraceful but it’s absolutley filthy.",1
"Received the best emergency eyecare possible. The staff are not only a credit to the Royal London but to our wonderful NHS.

A big thank you to Omar the Locum consultant and the wonderful lady with the hijab who took great care of me.

"My advice would be to avoid going to this hospital, mainly to Ward 3E, as staff is useless, helpless! Not satisfied at all!
Suggestion for the staff in 3E: If you do not know how to do your job professionally, please feel free to submit your CV at your local chicken shop, I hope they'll hire you ASAP.",1
"To the entire team of Royal London ITU,
Me, my family and all those that love our dad  send you this tribute of gratitude on his behalf.
The staff working effortlessly day in, night in, are angels destined to prove how saving lives can prove miraculous to loved ones in despair.
The senior consultants, mastering their knowledge in helping these helpless souls fight to live on. The right and the wrong taking it all as it comes.
Thank you.
The nurses, a level of care compassion we salute. What would we or dad be without you?
The family support team, the virtual visits, the handprints and disclaimers we will hold on forever. You were the only source of touch where he was hidden away and trapped between life and death.
The physio team, respiratory team, orthopedic team and countless others, your work and efforts answered our prayers in dad meeting two newborn grandsons.
To Frank who arranged the compassionate visit, thank you for turning the lights on in the dark.
Thank you from each and all of us for medically resurrecting dad and giving us all his existence again. He described you as the angels you are.
These words won't ever do you enough gratitude.
Thank you",5
"My father was placed in the neurological department after being at the a&e.
First of all the clinical care and competence he received was exceptional, from  dr Walsh in a&e  as well as the care he received from the neurological department. We received reassurance but also frequent and comprehensive updates from Molly and her team",5
Worst hospital avoid it. I went A&E for breathing difficulty and tightness. When seen by the nurse for observation he checked my BP and temperature which has nothing to do with what I went for only to be told to go to the urgent treatment centre as my case wasn’t emergency?? I don’t understand I have a medical history of breathing and I am anaemic also history of blood pressure. I tried to speak to him but he wasn’t having it and told me if I was really unable to breath I wouldn’t be talking?? How rude!! I asked if they would give me an inhaler at the urgent centre which is all i probably required and he said they might prescribe you it. So what is the point its nearly midnight and I’ll have to wait 2 hours to be seen by a out of hours gp that will end up prescribing it and wait a whole day as pharmacies are closed on a Sunday??? I have never been treated like this last time I had this problem in a different hospital I was admitted and looked well after regardless of how good my observation was.,1
"Absolutely disgusting, Trying to get through to the A&E Department is an absolute JOKE!!!!

First the phone will ring off for several minutes, then when they do pick up the will say they will get a nurse to talk with you then I was left waiting for 30mins, had to use the other line to see if I could get through.  Really need to take a look at there phone management.

Felt that I was on hold and forgotten about and still left with the worry about what was happening to my relative.

Once I got through with the other phone eventually, the nurse was very dismissive and did not seem to listen in relation to my concerns about my relative!!!",1
I love this hospital it's quite amazing and there's a lot of nice people and i love nice people because they do anything to help patients with problems!,5
"I can't comment on the attitude of the doctors or staff, or the state of the building but I understand that they are taking on foreign physicians without a basic knowledge of English, and without independently verifying that they have passed their OET exams.  This is potentially putting patients at risk.  I would be grateful if the authorities could verify the situation regarding OET for all physicians.  If I'm proven wrong then I'll happily change my review, thank you.",1
"100 people waiting on URGENT Treatment Centre. Everyone confined in the same small space, half without wearing face covering. 4 hours waiting time. We pay thousands of pounds in taxes to get this service when we urgently need it! Better to just leave this country right? Shame on you NHS!!!",1
"horrible experience at this hospital and with their attendee staff. I went in around 10 pm for severe abdominal pains. I am from the US, but had my passport, insurance card, employer information etc. The women at the front desk was unfriendly and told me to wait. I then proceeded to sit there for over 2 hours and watched people come in and wait less than 20 minutes. I asked her if it was an insurance issue and she told me I would be seen soon (after over an hour, and no one was still in the waiting room that came over 20 minutes after me). I then went back after an 1 1/2 to ask and she was incredibly rude and told me that other issues were more severe. This is from someone that did not ask a patient about an injury or document it. I would not go back and would definitely not recommend to anyone.",1
The A&E here is an absolute joke. After consulting over the phone with 111 and my GP both urged me to go to A&E ASAP for some severe abdominal issues I was experiencing. The reception staff were extremely rude. First I was yelled at because I didn’t know where the queue was and then in the middle of being registered the staff member took a call and literally ignored me for 5 minutes. I was told I would be called shortly. After about an hour I was given a piece of paper and told the computer system was down so everything was being done manually. Then after 3 hours I asked if there was any update and told it could be another 6 hours and that they didn’t know where I was in the queue because the systems were still down. An absolute farce! At this point I left and went elsewhere as I had lost all confidence in this place and really didn’t feel comfortable being treated there.,1
I used the urgent walk-in service on a fairly busy night. It took about an hour and a half in total which I'll say was a win given how many people were waiting. The staff were all very kind and doing their best to stay upbeat and keep people from feeling stressed which is always appreciated.,5
The receptionists in the pregnancy departments are RUDE AND THERE WAS LIKE 2 I came across. 1 refused to check my sister the day she went hospital over due & turned her away while in pain which could've caused a bigger problem for her child due to this one individuals mistake . 2nd one basically refused to assist me the day my sister went into hospital and I wasn't sure what ward she was in and she said she wasn't on the system but didn't even bother checking and then found out she was in another ward but another letter and thirdly there was a woman who was working there in a blue outfit and she was rude going out speaking rudely to me for no reason altho these types of people ruined my experience to the experience I didn't wanna go back there was some friendly midwifes who assisted my sister and lovely understanding people who helped and I wish I knew their names to appreciate people who deserve appreciation and overall the service they provide is good for their mothers but refusing to see people isn't the best solution.,3
"The worse place you could go to be treated. I am a first aider and everytime I sent someone there to be checked they spent hours waiting. Recently, I sent someone with high blood pressure symptoms,  heavy breathing, pain in the chest and difficulty walking. She spent 5 hours waiting and in the end she didn't get any result or treatment. I am never going or sending someone there. I simply do not understand why do I have to give monthly so much money to NHS and be treated this way...I could give more details about this hospital but it is not worth my time...Just go anywhere else if you want to be treated humanly!!!",1
Always work improvements around and easy to get lost due not enough info (only if you driving). Difficult to stick to the appointments they give you because they change for the own good and they change you just because doctors having a day off. If u try to change the main reception may give you two months ahead but if u call the direct number the appointment can be made at any time. Not issue with any doctors I collaborate with but need better organization.,2
"Probably the worst hospital ever. Staff is super rude and the waiting is just unbelievable. Even when you ask about your turn, they just come back with rude replies. All day got wasted ! Never ever going back",2
Despite the Covid Situation I was prepped for emergency surgery and the Consultant didn’t even turn up to do the surgery ! Left to suffer in pain and with a dangerous implanted battery that could explode in my abdomen still waiting for the reason or excuse of ‘ Why ‘ ? This has been an ongoing issue with this surgeon and the Royal London Hospital for many years. I received an email to advise that they would be looking into this ! As we all know ‘ Senior Surgeons on the Board ‘ won’t get any type of reprimand due to the position they hold !!,1
Came A&E as i was bleeding heavily with cramps and they referred me to the Urgent care centre. They said it was a 5 hour wait when i came in. There were people with less serious symptoms than me who were called before me. Its called an urgent centre only by name. You could be dying but you’ll still have to wait hours before they see you and they are just so slow.,1
"Was seen fast no complaints concerning registering/checking in or with the hardworking nurses on low pay working there but the GP consultant (EMMA) at this RL Urgent Care Centre who i was seen by was paranoid, insulting, moody, and very stressed out which didn’t help me receive a proper accurate diagnosis.

As usual because of coronavirus pandemic i was treated as if i could have had symptoms of covid-19 (very annoying) and was given an PCR test when reality was i was suffering from Asthma a respiratory condition i had a history of but this fact was completely ignored.

Unless your head is hanging Off avoid going to this NHS tory government run Royal London Hospital urgent care treatment centre it’s a 3rd world health service that falls well below the highest standards of healthcare you would receive in European hospitals and that’s tragic.",1
"Yesterday I went to A&E because I slipped and fell on my back and the pain was unbearable that I was afraid my bones were broken. After waiting for 1 hour, a doctor came to take me in to examine. They were extremely rude and did not show any sympathy towards me. They were not gentle and seems very rushed. After that, they suggested me to have an X-ray but then the X-ray staff said that I need to have a blood test before the Xray. Took them 1 hour to take my blood and they let me waited 4 more hours for the blood test results. They told me it only takes one hour but it was 4! Then after waiting another hour for Xray they said to wait 2 more hours for the xray results. At this point I already give up. I took my belongings and go home and not even a nurse notices me. All the staff was extremely unhelpful and everytime I saw them stand in groups to chit chat about dating and movies. I was so frustrated for waiting for 10 hours with no result and the staff was just very relaxed. Since there were not many patients, I don't understand how it took so long. The services are the worst among all the hospitals I have been in. Doctors are rude and staff just sit and do nothing basically. The worst experience in my life. I feel like since it is free the staff are doing me a huge favor so I am not allowed to complain. Trust me if you come here, you will go through the same experience so save yourself and go somewhere else or even pay a little money for private hospital where they respect the patients and work more efficiently.",1
"Stayed in Ward 7E as my son had developed pancreatitis. The staff were wonderful and he was excellently taken care it by all the doctors and nurses.
I can’t thank them enough.
Excellent views of London too.",5
"I came in to A&E straight from road accident.
I had dislocated AC joint and ruptured ligaments in my shoulder. I have been told by a doctor that bone will go back in it's place(as it was sticking out from its  original place by few cm) by itself and was sent away with a sling and paracetamol. After 4 days of agony I received phone call from New fracture clinic with a specialist telling me that my shoulder will heal on its own and I am being discharged.
I found it to be unbelievable that someone can make this decision based on X-ray, where my injury was more than dislocation related to soft tissues damage and ruptured ligaments. When I questioned the doctor about state of my soft tissue she said not to worry and that it will heal.
Being in agony I knew it is not the right thing to do.
Same day I flew to different country to seek specialist help. I have been told by different specialist that due to my muscle mass in upper body this injury wouldn’t heal and I would be in pain for a very long time, additionally I could forget about doing any sport (considering I am semi-pro athelete). Additionally I have consulted surgeons specialist Who confirmed I am in need of surgery if I ever want to use my shoulder again and ruptured ligaments and that sever fractures do not heal by itself.
Now post surgery I am happy to be able make full recovery thankfully to professionals in a different country.

And I advise anyone not to let be crippled or mislead by doctors or specialist in this hospital ,as I I would follow their advice most probably I would never do any sports again and be crippled. I am still shocked how someone can make soft tissue decisions based on x-Ray and definitely will crawls anywhere else than this hospital if I ever have another accident.",1
"I just git back from The Royal London Hospital A&E. I got bitten badly by one of our rescue cats. I reported at arrival directly and clearly which other health conditions I have, was seen directly without any waiting time by the nurse and got directly and quick send to the doctor who was very friendly and nice, he helped me a lot, calmed me down and took my worries of me, we were out there with the needed prescription in less then 30 minutes from our arrival time. I can only say THANK YOU VERY MUCH to the receptionist, nurse and doctor!!!!",5
"I have waited 3 hours so that a traumatologist could take a look at my dislocated knee. Instead the appointment took 10 seconds, where I was told to only push it back in myself if it dislocates again, no problem 🤣",1
they are kind and helpful but very slow. I had a temperature and waited for almost 1hour. It's strange the doctor really cares about have I been pregnant because of my stomachache but didnt do any check..,4
"Appaling service in A&E. My relative was reffered by gp and i had gone with him to this hospitals a&e as asked. 3hours of waiting they tell us we need to go home n wait for doctors to phone us in few days (he has serious condition + fluids in his tummy, gained 10kg overnight). Next thing they don't call us whole week while hes going worse n worse daily, i end up calling our hepatology doctor and we get appointment in 5days. Getting there he sends us to a&e to wait for emergency endoscopy n to be admitted to hospital. 1.5hour of wait at reception not being called even to get into actual a&e department i go again to enquire and get told that he wasnt checked in and needs to go through whole que there no matter that doctor has told us that they must just admit him tonigh. Finally get through that, nurses come to put canula in and they can't catch a vein in 8 times! Few different nurses/doctors. Moreover the worst shock was to see 1.5 bottles of Bell's whiskey in their utility room! Too bad that due to stress over day i have not thought of just taking my phone out and getting a picture. Carelessness is shocking as well as attitude with patients and their relatives. If a staff cannot put canula in within 8x in emergency, although we have MRI, CT and other scans weekly and they put canula in during those in 10seconds. Why does it have to be 8 in A&E department!",1
"I have been in a fire and cannot breathe, have been having trouble breathing since it happened. My head hurts and I feel like im going to faint. I have been waiting here for two hours to get a lung scan, but have gotten absolutely no where. It is 1 am in the morning. Theres a kid puking and clearly very ill, also have been waiting with me for 2 hours. We are in the emergency section. This is a joke.",1
"It’s really sad to see that the doctor of royal london stroke [Specialist as they says] my grandmother had a stroke 4 days ago ,went in the emergency after 9 hours my grandmother was taken in care unit ward 11c
No proper response by staff and lack of negligence and doctor can’t help us out .
phone are ringing on the counters 3 staff are there no one is receiveing phone call .
after 4 day doctor said we can’t do any thing either you take patients at home or she is not going to survive  They didn’t even bother to give food or fluid through the nose pipe
Nurses are coming in 45 minutes to see the stroke patients how on Earth is it possible
after the my grand mother came in the hospital nearly 2 days nurses was on the phone saying that doctor will give you a call  .which we havent received any call .from 2 days no proper response my team .some of the nurse are helpful
we have all the converstation recorded of doctor the way he speaks and talks is very unprofessional and unpleasant
she got discharge after 4 days and ambulance was requested by royal london to take her home arrived after 3 hours
don’t have value for human life .                 not all doctors and nurse are same .
{ Any one regarding stroke avoid this hospital as much as possible.. }
such big trust and hospital has a big mess
Some one needs to look in this matter deeply
So next time no one can suffer the way we did .
Had seen some few reviews same as my situation .really disappointed and sad to see and hear this hospital reviews and personal experiences
I will surely mention the doctor name who’s lacks of negligent  and attention of taking care of my grand mother

"Had a great experience at Lotus Birth Centre - the midwives are very professional, friendly and kind. They have supported the labour with utmost care - checks every 15min, explaining everything and offering many options. They are a fantastic team, a big shout out to Dell, Anne, Paulina, Elisabeth, Mosun, Charleena and the rest! Thank you for everything.",5
Had an appointment with a dermatologist today to get a couple of moles on my back checked out.The dermatologist that attended me was very professional. Since I’m getting my moles removed they had to take some professional pictures of them. The lady that took them was very friendly. The dermatology department is on the second floor. Easy to follow directions,5
"I have been here for chest pain, short of breathing and left arm is numb, because i am young they are not worried even if the doctor from 111 said it was a priority to do an ECG. Thank God i am not having a heart attack... i would be dead. I can't even go home because they said I have to wait for an ECG as it could be life threatening.
It has been 3 hours no one called my name yet.
When I broke my leg a couple of years ago, I had to wait 7hours without a cast sitting on the floor in Lewisham hospital... i think this is a common theme at NHS. They need to rethink the system seriously. Some people are sent to A&E for belly pain... this is not normal and impact real emergency.",1

"My partner is 40 weeks and 3 days overdue with her pregnancy and the staff at 6E have some terrible attitude, we have been in the same room since Monday and they keep making excuses and saying they have to priortize other new cases. But they dont understand that my partner has been in the same room since Monday and she has severe pain and its not helping with the pregnancy at all. On Tuesday her water broke and my partner was standing as the water was dropping constantly, I asked 4 different midwifes if they can check my partner they all seem to pass the buck around and it ended being 1 hour before someone bothered. Not sure what more to expect from this ward, 6E not the best at all. As it stand we are still in the same room.",1
"Trying to get a prescription medication from Lloyds pharmacy at the Royal London Hospital is as seem less as extracting teeth. Apart from the fact the staff are surly, Curt and toxic they don’t seem to have any order or practical processes in place to ensure a half decent service. After being told by my consultant to telephone before coming to collect my prescription I had to call 82 times before being answered, now I know why he told me that.

When my call was answered I was put on hold indefinitely, until I disconnected the call. I only used this pharmacy because it was hospital administered prescription otherwise AVOID Lloyds pharmacy like it is COVID-19, not a pleasant experience and you might end up dying before your medication is dispensed.",1
Worse hospital ever rude staff nurses doctors security they don’t care about you just the money they are making. Do better embarrassing also very much racist if your white you’ll have a great experience if you are other coloured don’t even bother,1
"Worst experience ever, the only way to be treated professionally at this hospital is if you’re about to die, otherwise they’ll keep lying and will make you wait forever because it’s not an “emergency” even if you’re having a hard time, what a disgrace. No accountability and no standards whatsoever

Total waste of tax money, very deceitful name as there is nothing royal about this joke of a hospital, should be renamed “Death Beds Hospital”",1
94 year old grandmother arrived by ambulance at 21:21 after a terrible fall at home. Hand over was at 21:46. She quickly had bloods taken and was sent for an X-ray and CT scan. At 3:28 we were told she has broken her arm and her wrist. She would need her wrist plastered and to stay in. Gone 7am and we are STILL waiting for her to be plastered. We have no idea how long she is going to be waiting for.,1

"went to the children a&e yeaterday for the first time as my baby got a hair tourniquet. maybe I was lucky but we didnt wait for even 1 minute and it was all done in 5 minutes. the nurses and doctors were all super sweet and caring.

AMAZING!",5
"👎Poor service management & useless condescending staff that's wasting money in the NHS one doctor thinks they know better then another only thing that is consistent is the abusively poor service & neglect. It was a totally demoralising degrading experience in there a month & made me depressed 😭 couldn't wait to get out 😧. Its freezing 😨 cold at night no heating can't even open a window for fresh air the meals & meal times are a joke & half time cold & over cooked 💩.

They lie & cover each other when complain it's a farce & just palm you off to NHS advocate Phower/Voiceabillity one in the same service funded by same people your trying to complain about.  Keep eye on family & friends especially the older patients admitted some staff treat patients worse then animals & heavy handed.

Once you go through door you lose your rights or your treated like you have none.  Excuse being tired don't give them right to take it out on patients & if you pay enough attention you'll notice half just sitting about talking. Nurses & doctors are just rude & disrespectful its not how they are to your face its what they do behind your back!!!

Ignore patients mental health conditions to benefit them? 😔 lacking a standard of care & NHS its not free its paid for by our taxes the ones we pay it's just not private!

Now been told i have cancer which has spread due to them taking so long to look at symptoms i asked for another consultant & have been told if i don't like it go elsewhere & last 2 months not even offered chemotherapy & maybe radiotherapy which they clearly say i need & i'm under their care? I now fear for my life

Took my son at 3am and no one attended him until I approached him! Nurse says need antibiotics and then sends me over to the urgent treatment unit and they give me nothing!! And tell me to go back if not better in a few days!!,1
"I appreciate this hospital and I feel like they do a good job at times. Urgent care centre has a doctor who goes by Dr.ali he’s a little overweight and Asian background.
This man was trying to be polite but failed, he was very insensitive, made assumptions instead of asking questions this was very offensive to me and I expressed this to him but instead of apologising he said that he’s just doing his job yet he can see my records.
There’s also a European lady with blonde hair who was rude to me when I asked for his name.

Do better Dr Ali

The appointment system for the Dermatology was appalling. My daughter's GP made a referral in April 2017 and took me numerous phone calls to the central appointment to get confirmation about whether they had received the referral and an appointment  was made. Then they scheduled the appointment without informing my daughter and on the day of her arrival and simply  told her the  original appointment was cancelled and was rescheduled. No lettersor text messages were sent to notify her. Then the rescheduled appointment was rescheduled again with a text message sent on a sunday morning. So we can't call anyone to check. We are making an official complaint about this lack of professionalism and failure to deliver a public service on time.,1
Went for an appointment at the opthalmic clinic. I arrived 40 mins late. They were quite happy to see me and I had a good examination. Not too happy with my next appointment which is on 31 December.,5
Excellent staff excellent service beautiful building. Did not have to wait at all. All doctors nurses and team were ready upon arrival and knew what they were doing. I would like to thank everyone who helped us out through our difficult time.,5
"Absolutely fabulous place. Here under dr drew provan amazing, great hematology unit but also excellent for the birth of my baby in the antenatal ward. Sometimes during pregnancy difficult to get through to on phone lines but honestly a great place with excellent doctors. All places always can improve but great place",5
"One off the worst hospital Britain ever have, people's going to hospital for treatment to cure but here you will caused more problem in your body. Literally you will cry for your helpless situation. I know there are thousand off NHS worker and hospital staff working tirelessly for the people during this tough time which I appreciate and respect. But Royal London is totally different. Better avoid and go somewhere else.",1
"Horrible experience today at the Fracture Clinic.
Consultant was dismissive and rude. He told me my doctor wasn't here. A minute later I see my doctor down the hall going to a different consultation.

Unprofessional staff that is even lying to your face.

"Super professional, kind people. Really helped me a lot in a very stressful situation. The wait was relatively short compared to my expectations. At most 30 min at any single point and less than 2h in total.",5
"I've been waiting nearly 5 years to have treatment for  2 slipped disks in my spine. It's taken so long because the appointments are so far apart and they had to redo my MRI 3 times because it was left for so long. I was under Alexander Montgomery and in the entire 5 years I only saw him once and that was by request. I had to wait 9 months to see him, only to be told that he could do nothing because I was pregnant by now and to come back after I'd had my baby, which is understandable but it shouldn't have gotten to the point where this has gone on for so long that me having a child 4 years later was another set back. Every single consultant I've seen apart from the latest one was more concerned with telling me to pump myself full of painkillers, rather than actually addressing the problem.
Eventually after all this time I was listed for bi-lateral joint injections over a month a go. I've heard nothing in regards to an appointment and when I call to chase it up the phone either rings out or someone from the Frature Clinic tells me that they don't know what to do and they can't help me. The only reason I've given 2 stars is because the hospital is always clean, the reception staff are nearly always helpful and polite and the last consultant I saw,  Mr Ramsey, actually did something to help me. But even now as I'm writing this, the phone has been ringing for 20 minutes and no one has picked up so I doubt anything will be happening any time soon.",1
"I waited 5 hours to be seen at the emergency.Saturday.
Gideon Ginossar  received me and literally did nothing. He didn't check my NHS record I had to explain everything, I gave my symptome, almost fainted at work and 20 min of tachycardia, feeling numb. Said my last result of potassium were bad. He didn't even listen the end, couldn't care less, listen my heart with a stethoscope, didn't even took my blood pressure.Refuse to do any blood test as I requested, told me to deal with a GP and that i waited for nothing as he didn't feel like he wanted to do any test. Made sure I left the room after few minutes,said he didn't know what I had and didn't give any advices. If he is a doctor I am the Queen of England",1
"Currently staying in a bed on ward 11E and there are two patients that are disturbing everyone at 3/4am. There are any even enough nurses to cool them down, reasure us other patients and get us different beds. You’d think a hospital ward would be a peaceful place to at least get sleep!",1
The best hospital in tower hamlet. My baby was born there. Nurse's  are friendly. Midwives are awesome.   Waiting time not so bad compare to people going there. Hospital is super clean and its new and all modern.,5
"It was really a bad experience.
It waited 5 hours to get checked because my chest was hurting really badly and after  a little chat they told me just to take some painkillers....
I need to say it was ironic how the main answer here for all the single type of iniury it's always painkillers,instead to waisting people time and health double and triple check every single thing before to say go home rest and take painkillers....",1
"I was admitted to this hospital on Sunday 15th Dec after a nasty fall whilst I was on holiday in London,
I was really impressed by the care and attention I received from all, paramedics, A&E staff, etc.  I was moved on to Ward 12E where I was carefully monitored due to a head injury, the staff were absolutely brilliant, so kind and caring.  I had a physiotherapist access my balance etc, I was given exercises to do at home.  I was eventually discharged on the Wednesday and went home to Devon.
I also have to mention the fabulous food, who said hospital food was rubbish hasn’t been to the Royal London, what a choice.
Thank you so much to EVERYONE involved in my treatment",5
"ER staff are very professional, pleasant & helpful.
The Renal Dept. on 9th fl. Doctors, Nurses, Dietary, Therapists, & Domestic staff are all pleasant & excellent. The nurses make you feel at home.  👍🏽",5
The staff are great waiting times aren't bad for how many people they get through there doors day and night. Clear and past year's with family member having treatment there we are very pleased with the treatment me more with depression and anxiety.,5
"Out patient and doctors are brilliant but I spent 6 nights in hospital after a really major and brutal operantion and I got so tired hearing how much the nurses hated their jobs, one nurse told me 'no pain, no gain'.  Absolutely appalling behaviour by staff.  we were harassed on our ward by another patient who obviously spent a lot of time in hospital and did what she wanted when she wanted and when I complained about her constantly being on the phone 24 hours a day I then got harassed by this patient and called a racist and they did nothing and refused to move me.  Also there still isn't any tv wiring on the 8th floor so all you have to do all week is lay there and remember how crap you feel.  Not happy about my time in the hospital.  OH and lets not forget the disgusting food on offer but that seems to be in all London hospital - warmed up ready meals is not my idea of food to get better with.  Only one nurse my whole time there used hand sanitiser as well and this ward had patients with fresh wounds!  Yep came out of there with MRSA!!!!!",3
They make us wait for entire fc hours but then do nothing after,1
Was very worried when I was referred to Cardiology. But I was seen incredibly quickly. Doctor was great. Told me the ECG done by the GP was a 'mechanical error'. They did another one which they said was completely normal. Have to have further tests but they were so clear and considerate and professional throughout. Did my health good.,5
"A big thank you to St.Johns Ambulance who looked  after my elderly dad yesterday extremely well,  caring polite and respectful after he took a fall, as he was about to watch the Lord Mayor Show, in the City, they took him to The Royal London. Where from the time he arrived he was looked after,  checking him over. Blood tests, ECG, Xrays. (Left shoulder)  All came back clear. He arrived at Approximately 13.50hrs and was back in North London by 18.30 hrs. Remarkably staff in all departments, proud to say what a fantastic NHS we have in this country, especially under all the strain and stress of Covid. A big thank you all those involved. One relieved concerned Daughter.",5
Paediatric dentistry team brilliant. They were absolutely lovely and took care of my daughter and rhe procedure was long and intense but worth while. However reception and the helpline for paediatrics dentistry not very helpful and rude 😒.  Shame thier attitude and behaviuor ruins everything 😑,5
"After reading some reviews, and have had a fear of giving birth in this hospital I was attending for my maternity appointments. But when time came my midwife Nolyn Munuto and midwife in training  Akasha Ligertwood where so helpful and supportive,  I felt lucky and very safe in their care. I hope them well , and other lady who stayed overnight was great too . Postnatal ward surprised me with food choice as they served spicy chicken and rice,  while I was trying to breastfeed,  it didn't seem ok to eat that kind of meal.",5
Some very good doctors in the renal department. Pleased to have their facilities and expertise. Timely access to doctors can be an issue and you may come across the odd grumpy staff member who hates their job and lacks customer service skills.,4
Terrible hospital. Waited many hours to be tested. They decided to operate and changed date of operation twice. After op they told her she can go home in 24 hours. 48 hours later finally said she can go then realised they couldn't release her because no one in the pharmacy was answering the phone to get her meds. Refused to provide prescription and if she discharged herself they would tell her what doctor was going to prescribe. 4 days turned into 10. No wonder NHS is in so much trouble.,1
"Honestly I would give it 0 if I could. I had a horrible digestive problem that needed immediate treatment so I made the worst decision of coming here for A&E. They made me wait 7 hours whilst I screamed in pain. After 7 hours of waiting they sent me home like I arrived. Honestly worst experience ever. If you need quick and effective treatment, you should not come here.",1
"After waiting for 3h+ to be seen by a doctor he seemed more interested in asking where I am from, what am I doing here, whether I plan to get back to my country and who I am living with than actually checking out my health condition. Was this part of protocol? After I left my so called examination he refused to give me a paper for the GP as I needed blood tests and now I have to go through this humiliating experience all over again until obtaining paperwork for my tests. Thanks UK.",1
"Will always be grateful to Dr Edwards, Dr Dowe, Diane, Rachel, Si and the rest of the amazing team on ward 14F who looked after my grandma Doris in her final days. Thank you for your kindness and compassion.",5
"Went for a proper bandage for my bleeding finger the nurse at A&E did a shoddy bandage and sent me to urgent care where the wait time is apparently 5 hours, never coming back here honestly",1
"I just got turned away from the dental emergency department despite being in acute pain and having facial swelling. I have never heard anything like it. Will be pursuing this but unfortunately I didn't get the woman's name. She told me there's only one dentist and no students at the moment. I now have a huge face and headache but at least the antibiotics have started working. Really really bad service, probably bordering on negligent.
Maybe worth noting that this was at 9am on Monday 3rd August.",1
"Saved my life from an internal organ that just decided it was bored and might explode.
Presented me with a bill for £0 after doing this and caring for me for a week, whilst I couldn’t eat or drink anything or it might kill me
Oh, did you have to wait for a long time when it was hot??? They don’t control the weather, so shut up.
Oh, was the food not to your liking?? Don’t eat it, shut up.
Was the receptionist not your BFF?? They’re overworked and underpaid, shut up.
Long live the NHS, if you don’t like it vote Tory and see how well you do after it’s been sold off and we get an American style For Profit system. £1500 just for an ambulance ride, and it only goes up from there.",5
7 hours waiting for kids emergency awful service,1
"I checked the reviews before going and I was happy to see how good the staff seemed to be.

I went to the minor injuries department and the first thing I was asked was if I was living in the UK and for how long, after 8 years working and living in the UK I felt uncomfortable with that, not for the question on itself, but the way she asked it. And then the nurse who attended me ask me if I needed a translator, seriously??? I can understand very well English, I wonder if she can go to another country and survive, not with that attitude, even this lady laughed at me when I told her that I could get an infection if the bone was broken, and she said ""That's not possible, to get and infection an opened wound is needed for the air to come in!!"" Well, ok, I do not work in health sector but I know you can get an internal infection if the bone is broken , and I also said that because I read it the night before (information provided by the NHS on its website). Maybe she had a bad day but the treat I received it wasn't as I would expect from sanitary staff. At the end they told me to take paracetamol and rest my hand (something that is impossible if you have a normal active life). My conclusion is that in this country the doctors resolve everything with taking drugs.",2
"Attended A&E after feeling very unwell at work and sent by GP, care and attention was first class given the pressure they are under. Must not name or single people but RC to whom I was referred was excellent and extremely professional. They are a credit to NHS and sick of people putting it down, yes mistakes are made but given volume of traffic, it  is a tiny % and they do an unbelievable job. It is a shame they are inundated with too many visits from people who are not clearly not A&E critical but let down by the old GP waiting times. Thanks to all.",5
"After waiting three and a half hours with panic attacks etc when I'd told them I was feeling suicidal, I then walked out, no one stopped me. I got some whiskey and some pills and woke up on Homerton hospital with tubes sticking everywhere. Worst service ever. If my sister hadn't have found me in time and the staff at Homerton hadn't looked after me so well I would be dead thanks to this hospital. Don't waste your time here. The doctor's didn't care one bit I could hear them all laughing about what someone had for lunch whilst I'm crying and hyperventilating in the waiting room. No offer of water or tissues, only approached me when I decided to sit on the floor cos the chairs weren't comfortable after two hours sitting there. The nurse spoke to me as if I were a child and still made no offer for tissues, water. They don't care about the patient.",1
Worst hospital as someone who has sadly have to come here numerous time due to unfortunate illness this is honestly the worst of the worst hospital I’ve ever experienced the waiting times are and absolutely joke got told the queue was 6 hours only to be seen 10 hours later after being slashed on the leg,1
"Thank you for saving my sons life, your ICU was nothing short of brilliant, not just to my son who was in a terrible motorbike accident, but towards the whole family, the care, cleanliness and treatment he/we received was simply amazing, thank you to all the staff. My son is slowly recovering in a brain injury unit now after being transferred, but without you he would not be here at all. Forever grateful to you all x x",5
"Horrendous queues. I waited for 5 hours at A&E and the people coming after me had to wait 7, as the staff wrote it on a board to inform new patients. Overworked staff. They all look tired. The government's budget cuts visibly affected this hospital so much over the years. I needed a drip because of being overly dehydrated due to sickness and begged whether they can put me on one. They told me resources are scarce and they could use it only if my condition was more 'serious'. This would not have been the same 5-10 years ago when the hospital was functioning well with better budgets.",1
"Went for an evening full-body MRI on referral by St. Barts' pain clinic.  Nice, new facility.  The technician was very nice; I had concerns because my back is such a mess that I've not laid down in over a dozen years; have to sleep sitting up.  I knew I was going to have to lay down in the chamber; he propped my knees up with a few pillows, which is the only way I could have gotten through it.  Well done.  I'll be going back here for steroid injections under x-ray; looking forward to it.",5
"The most rude staff at the reception ever. Fat ladies staying behind the window talking with each other not paying attention at all what I was saying. When I explained why I went there she asked me if wanted to see anyone? No just went to tell that in pain and I’m going home.. Seriously NHS you should do something about the service. I am not expecting 5* customer service, but not need to be rude with me.",1
is very sad a incredible country uk london the hospitals have everything but no staff and some of the staff very rude :( sad sad,2
"I gave birth via C Section to a beautiful baby boy on October the 11th and had the best treatment and help I could have wished for by all the hard working Doctors, Midwives and Nurses that works at London Royal Hospital! They made me, my partner and my baby feel safe during the 3days we stayed at the hospital and I would like to thank every single one of them!
Really think that it is one of the best hospital i've been to!",5
"Updating my review after my relative's recent visit. He was not very happy. Long wait for doctors appointments, tests - something between 3-7 months. Doctors are good but hospital is overcrowded and ovebooked with hours waiting in over busy small waiting areas.",3
"Some of the nurses are really nice. however the admin staff in the a&e department are really rude! they have no respect for anyone, they speak to you the way they want. They are absolutely rude. and when i questioned them about their customer service and way the spoke to me they had nothing to say! Seriously the management need to sort this out becuase this a regular thing when i go there.",2
"The child went to the emergency department, and the waiting time was as long as 8 hours. The medicine given by the doctor was not available in 12 pharmacies. I was very disappointed.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by outstanding care I received yesterday from entire team at day surgery ward. I literally observed everything, especially after hearing regular bad talk about NHS. From the thorough presurgery screening, the surgery team and the nurses who looked after me afterwards; I received nothing other than exceptional care and the hospital was clean and well organised. General aneasteasia team made me laugh which was exact point when I needed to be distracted. The only downside was bit of a wait as I didn’t have exact surgery time; and very basic hospital meals offered; however on larger scale of things, I see these points rather minor.",5
"Not a bad hospital. I ve only visited twice at A&E. The waiting time can be long depending how many patients are before you. But it could be better if the receptionists are able to predict a waiting time, instead they would refer you to ask the nurses when they come out.",4
"Had a very disappointing experience trying to get an appointment for antenatal care.
Nobody answer your emails even an automatic replay will do for the first time, but they just don't bother. It's okay if they can't see me till week 10, but at website they say: ""once your referral has been received a booking appointment with a midwife will be sent out to you and ideally be completed before the week 10 of your pregnancy"".
I am waiting more than two weeks for any information from them.",3
"In the delivery suite, the midwives during the night shift can be very laid back. I had the worst experience at Royal London. One of the staff members was extremely rude. I was going through a termination. I was very strong when I went in. It's not the termination, that made me weak. It's the way I was treated at the Royal London that made me so weak and upset. I never want to go there again.",1
"I visited a friend who had broken his knee (ouch) and was impressed with the care (especially by his gorgeous Australian Physio - I think I might break something just to see her again!) he was given in a nice clean ward in the modern part of the hospital. He even said the food was nt bad, not necessarily good, but not bad! They also save a lot of lives here and like all of the NHS they are underfunded. So 5 starts from me!",5
"Really disappointed with my visit to the dental department today.

My dentist believes I have Trigemenal Neuralgia, and organised this appointment for firm diagnosis and looking at what lies behind it.

The doctor was busy working when I came in, and it seemed that a page had ""disappeared"" from her computer screen. She was pre-occupied with this when she asked me to describe symptoms. I started telling her, but  there was a loud knock on the door. I expected her to say she was with a patient, but the person (member of staff) came in and said the receptionist had knocked on the door but recieved no response. There was a brief exchange.

I started again, and there was a second knock on the door. This time someone (member of staff) brought in a patient's DNA test. There was chat about the lateness of the test, and the doctor said she wanted to look at the findings. I waited.

I started a third time, and the phone rang. I fully expected her to ignore this, but she picked up.

For the fourth time, disheartened, I tried explaining my symptoms. She asked if my jaw clicks. I said it does not.

She did a brief check in my mouth and pressed with her fingers around my jaw and forehead. Again, she asked if my jaw clicks (it does not).

She sent me for an X-ray.

Back in the room,  she said I don't have any of the symptoms associated with TN (had she actually listened, she may have found I have several, as picked up by my dentist). Instead, she said she thinks I may have sprained my jaw (I absolutely disagree with this) and that I may have ""intermittent acute dysfunction"" (of what, wasn't made clear - nor what I should do about it). She asked, for a third time, if my jaw clicks.

She asked if I was happy for her to discharge me, and I agreed since there was no useful help/advice forthcoming.

The lack of focus and care I experienced today was appaling and I sincerely hope this was a one-off rather than how all patients are treated. I was not heard, which is a real shame. I had hoped to receive help with the insane pain.",2
"Our dad died due to lack of care. He was in a kidney ward 9E, quality of care and attention was almost non existant. So sad this is what so called Great Britain has become. Nothing great about it anymore. It's a teaching hospital and from the ward we were treated that was apparent. General convo to try and gain a repore with the Dr we asked what are your career plans and he is interested in going back to studying and become a so called medical fellow. It seems these are just case studies. As a pharmacist I will tell all kidney failure patients to be very careful about getting treated at the royal london as this hospital has the poorest aftercare. Head of wards are never to be seen until you are literally dieing and then they say sorry. They are on over 100k if not 200k. Absolute waste of our tax payers money when it should be spend on quality staff who actually deserve it.",1
"The structure doesn’t have the resources for Covid-19 patients. I’ve been asked by a nurse of the emergency department to wait in the street with a temperature in the cold with the wind blowing. 111 adviced me to go there, but they don’t know how hospitals manage the Covid patients. My symptoms got worse staying in the cold and I had to go back home as I had short breath, a temperature and couldn’t stand.",1
"Incompetent doctors in the emergency system, with no desire to work...",1
Came in with my son who had a really high temperature. First they saw us after an hour which wasn't so bad but then they left us sitting there with some diarrolite for a good few hours. It's past 3 in the morning the doctor is no were to be found and why on earth is there only the one doctor around. This wasn't the first time this happened and I'm guessing it definitely  will not be the last. A&E needs to sort itself out especially children's A&E because it really ain't fair on these little kids who are left in the waiting room.,1
"I went to visit my friends dad on the acute ward Wednesday, who is a cancer patient. He was left in the corridor and collapsed where my friend looked after him and the nurse walked on by. Also asked for help yesterday regarding his pain, the nurse stood with her back to us and said she didn't know. He also does not have a McMillan nurse!! It's disgusting the way he has been treated. He has not been given any options for other treatment, and I can not believe that anyone who has cancer would get treated this way, disgusting service and rude staff.",1
Excellent customer service and medical assistance. Thank you. Linda,5
"When I arrived at this hospital after 24 hours of severe pain in my left kidney. I was already in another hospital but it was unsuccessfull. When I was sent to London Royal Hospital, I was quickly attended by a medical team who would properly medicated me and I was hospitalized once again. I was very well taken care of, beautifully cared for.  It's so wonderful when we seek medical help in search of taking our pain away and when the pain is taken away it is priceless. I am eternally grateful to each and everyone who took care of me in this Hospital I recommend 100% Thank you very much to Barts Health team  Renal high dependency Unit 9 floor south tower 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤️",5
Horrible experience at the Royal London Hospital. My dad had an accident and was bleeding when I got him in due to a cut on the head. He is 70 and after telling them that it's an accident and he is bleeding I was asked to wait for a doctor. Even after 4hours we were waiting for our number to be called. Pathetic service from doctors and staff. Never come to this place,1
"I went int around 5 am Friday morning for a sprained foot that was in a lot of pain and this is my local hospital so I'm used to the dissapointing service as well as the rude employees at this hospital. However, I was seen by Becky who I believe is a doctor and had gone out of her way to look for me at the x-ray area and found my friend sitting there whilst I had gone for an x-ray. She then later came back and asked if I'd like a wheelchair and I said yes and she was so lovely about it. She then had a look at my foot and was honestly one of the best doctors I've ever met, so friendly and so so lovely! She was very informative and took her time instead of rushing me. Since being home, my foot has started to feel slightly better and I have Becky to thank for that as i followed what she had advised. Had the lovelist experince with her! x",3
"Its ridiculous how this department is incapable of answering the phone. I've tried to get through on many occasions, It is virtually impossible to try get through on the phone and if by any chance you are successful they will either terminate the calls or just brush off dealing with you query. I'm disgusted by the level of service. I'm heavily pregnant and i hate that I have to physically walk into the clinic to get some help with my query/ make appointment etc. The reception team are lazy and inadequate.
The Doctors and Midwives are a pleasure  when you eventually get a chance to be seen by them.",1
"On 10th of August hospitalised and treated for the wrong diagnose. Because of that I had to return a 2nd time 10 days later when an incompetent nurse called Rachel destroyed my hand, digging in my hand and bursting my vein just to simply insert a needle to take blood sample - basic nursing practice! My hand bruised and swollen in seconds. Her reaction was that “it’s in my head, I’m fine, to look away if it hurts” - like looking away would have saved me of her atrocious treatment!! I seeked for help from another nurse who took the needle out which she forcefully taped to my hand claiming “since you react this way I am not going to take out as you won’t let me do another one” - utter ignorance to my pain and no acceptance of the fact she was doing it wrong! Verbally approached her minutes after to ask if my hand looked like “it was in my head” or was that reality? No apology, no trace of empathy, no treatment offered for the damage she caused and just walked away !! Rude, delusional behaviour and incompetence like I never seen. Stay away from her if you attend this hospital for your own sake or you’ll have extra injuries to worry about after leaving that hospital.",1
"Absolutely disaster!!!!!
I am 17 weeks pregnant with triplets and I choose the worst hospital in whole London

Today is the 3rd time when they change my appointment with out me I mean they didn't let me know . Officially my appointment should be this Friday but last friaday stupid reception call to me and explain that we need to change date because my consultant is not in on Friday I said ok no problem but I we and my fiancé we can do only Tuesday because it's my fiancé off and they are his children's too he miss nearly all of the scans ... so she said ok so Tuesday 10 o'clock. We came there and surprise what we heard from stupid reception im really sorry but you're appointment is tomorrow on 9 o'clock?!?!?!?!?! What the hell ?!?!? Again ?!?!?!

I get really angry but another surprise they give me another appointment for week after and I don't know anything about this ...

I start screaming on them that this is absolutely ridiculous because they done it 4 time already to me !!!!

And they call midwife

She was lovely but another surprise

I said to midwife that on the phone every time I was telling I got triplets and I need specialist to do baby scan and again the same situation...
She said that is something wrong because specialists which doing triplets scan they are off on Tuesday and Friday!!!! Then I just start crying !!!!!! Because they give me appointments for this days I said to midwife that I am 17 weeks pregnant with triplets and I wasn't got done yet blood test I wasn't been weighed since 1st appointment no urine tested or blood pressure was taken nothing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is ridiculous and they telling me that I'm not allowed to stress because triplets pregnancy is high risk pregnancy but every single time when I'm going there they sending me back to home because my appointment is for different day ....

Worst place ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I will never recommend this hospital to anyone never !!!!",1
"Horrible experience, they say 2.5 waiting time when I stayed for at least 4, dizzy and Berkeley sitting because of my injury.
Staff is also super super rude

Edit: I actually ended up staying there for 10h because the first time I was told to wait (and waited) for 5h in the wrong area and appointed to the wrong doctor",1
Newham hospital sent my mum home with a blood pressure of 249/118. Royal London let her in and gave her the best treatment I’ve seen in a long time. My mum could’ve been dead if it weren’t for Royal London. 5/5,5
"Its an ""automated peace at heart"" place, knowing the people in charge of treating our loved ones are the best around. The hospital is clean the staff are friendly. Located in a very good area to get to. Parking can be an issue though",5
"I went there twice and I didn't get help. So upseting. First time  I went there I had a chest pain and sore throat and he checked my legs. No diagnose at all and he run away. Second time the ""doctor"" was rude he said he not gonna investigate my sickness. He said the temperature doesn't make any sense and I'm negative for covid19 and he run away again.",1
"If I could I will give this hospital zero. The doctors are sadistic! This hospital needs to shut down. They don’t know they are doing and are very irresponsible because this one doctor gave my uncle the wrong medication and this mistake might have been the reason why he passed away. They said “have faith in us”, but I don’t have faith because they let my uncle down who is no more and left a family grieving 😭 NEEDS TO SHUT DOWN. Never go to his hospital because they will get your hopes and faith high and then dishearten you with terrible news.",1
"Had to visit the hospital tonight around 4 am for a facial X-ray due a punch. Very disappointed of the  blonde lady around 60s at the reception, very rude and unprofessional. This lady didn’t want me to be checked, since for her this wasn’t an emergency despite I had nausea symptoms for two days, headache, and no one was waiting in the room. Very professional the doctor instead, which he checked me and found out a broken nose.",2
The A&E and especially the UTC departments are a joke. The staff seem fed up and don’t really want to be there. Just sell the NHS already….6-7 hour waiting times is just not acceptable,1
"Really disappointed that they don't treat everyone in the same way, Joytunara Begum ward 11c stroke ward, she did not receive breakfast as other ward patients received theirs,  not only that she did not receive her last nights meal and went hungry,  when nurses are called the do not often come, sad and sorry state of affairs. My aunt had a stroke and definitely  needs attention at this time of life.",1
If I could give 10 stars I would. I went to A and E in some pain Friday night. I stayed for several hours while they put me out of my misery and took tests. Staff wonderful   Then this morning the hospital CALLED Me. (That way round) to fix new appointment   The NHS is a wonder of the world,5
"Visited elderly relative on ward 11E. Absolutely fantastic care. Reception staff very friendly & helpful. Thank you.
Lifts are complicated little buggers thou. 😂",5
"I have so much to thank the Royal London hospital for, as a child I suffered a massive seizure after an op. I nearly died as result but the doctors made me better and here I am today. I haven't attended the new hospital but did attend the old hospital many many times. The Dr's and nurses are very helpful",5
"Her name is Elle louise barker ,speciality midwife and student midwife samiya they are really really helpful .they saved my child and his mom .good bless you also I had a some bad experience with others",5
"I put a star because there is no option to give a zero score, carrying my pregnancy here, reception almost never found my appointments, they lost my book on one occasion nobody knew anything, they changed my midwife 3 times, after reaching 41 weeks of pregnancy I asked for induction, supposedly I would have my appointment for it, when I called they hung up on me immediately saying my name, in the end it was all theater every time I call to have time for my induction they tell me that they do not have beds, they shamelessly lie to make you reach 42 weeks, I am already 41 weeks and 2 days, I have no supervision and I fear for my health and that of my baby, I am very afraid, they have me like a balloon calling different numbers, I have already warned that since they have not allowed me to choose consequences to reach 42 weeks of pregnancy without supervision, I hope they take responsibility for anything that may happen, I do not recommend this hospital, I made a very bad choice to carry my pregnancy here score 0",1
The E&A receptionist of today morning (25th of November 2021 at 9:40am) are really rude if you don't speak English they just ignore you and don't even try to understand or call someone that could understand. I do speak a little English I was trying to show the receptionist my translation she didn't even bother to have a look just yelling at me and don't even bother to try to understand. IF you don't speak English don't go this terrible HOSPITAL.,1
"Went there to get a check up for a migrain that has been persistent for over a year.

Felt like some of the other doctors patronised me and looked down upon me but not the ones here which relived me.

Working through treatment and hope to find something out of the multitude of different things that they're offering that will help.

Good, recommended.",4
This hospital save my brother life thank you so much,5
"The worst hospital, i had a hand surgery and they made my hand disabled , i have no movement, i am going to make a complain against them! Please never choose this hospital.",1
"Seen as soon as was possible, it was quite busy, the doctor took his time to examine me.  Most surprisingly in spite of being a very very busy evening as one of the nurse in charge pointed out to an angry patient, almost everyone I came across was smiling.",5
This hospital A&E is a joke I have visited on numerous occasions and the Doctor's I have encountered seemed to not care less about my symptoms. Also because off this I developed something which could have been prevented if they bothered to examine me. Disgusting behaviour.,1
6 hours waiting for a heart condition. They really seem to not care here in the urgent care unit. Awful and needs to change,1
My child was in clinic 7f and amazing staff absolutely respectful and kind she’s left gifts for specific people including med student,5
"Changed my appointment, then denied the change, went today to find no parking was available after an hour wasted circling around, not even for disabled parking. Taxis everywhere clogging up all roads around hospital parking bays. There are three hospitals closer to me, that would be more convenient. The Royal London Hospital is a shambles for parking.",1
Very poor service and they make you  wait for hours for your booking. Or they cancel your booking last minute and tell you to book another day.,1
"I don't know where they find them,  took my wife to the A&E with excruciating pain,  in the reception there was a black guy (looked like he just came out of LA Gang, original gangster, no smile, hello, just a cold face) said ""whats your problem?"" Like he was about to pull a gun out. Really offended.

And then you had the doctors that's another long list of disappointments.  They really need to bring in someone to teach mannerisms and peoples skill.  The doctors are robots🤖 and living dead with no compassion (I understand they do long hours) but no excuse for bad behavior.

Really disappointed over all.",1
"My husband was flown to The Royal London Hospital by Air Ambulance. (While driving to work was hit by a stolen car) What a marvellous Trauma Hospital! They saved his life. Put his life changing injuries & him back together again. Thank you to all the staff & nurses, you are brilliant! With a special mention to Prof. Simon Holmes, Plastic Surgeon, who put his face back together & saved his life! We will always be Eternally Grateful to you all.",5
"Very friendly and caring people, short waiting time and comforting treatment. I gotta say, having lived in USA, Turkey, Russia and central europe before; never have I ever had such a nice hospital experience. It's never good to have your gf's ankle fractured but NHS took nice care of us today.",5
"I had to go to A&E today on the advice of my doctor, I was in and out in less than 2 hours, all the staff were professional, lovely and I couldn’t ask for a better service from the NHS thank you to all the doctors and nurses that treated me today",5
"My father in law 81 years old, was sent from the Gp by ambulance  has been in A and E since 1pm it's  been 20 hours he hasn't been moved to a ward. The Dr and nurses are great, but moving them to the ward is terrible.",1
"GREATIX
ANA INES REIS VERY KIND, EFFICIENT AND PROFESSIONAL.
I AM IN emergency Assessment bay 6 and she was awesome. Tracking everything.
Thank you.",4
"I would've gave 5 star rating but one nurse let that down. However the other nurses that looked after me treated me with such care, you could really tell they had a passion for the job they were in :)",4
"Thank you very much Elizabeth (Antenatal clinic staff) for ur kind support and help.
You were my midwife .I will always remember you.you did very good work.
Love u very much .

"It’s been almost 8 months that they haven’t called me in to change my braces or get them tightened  , I’m sick and tired . I have bands on my teeth which have now snapped and we’ve called them asking for appointment only for them to say they can’t do anything because they’re still trying to fit people in form last year …honestly one of the worst hospitals I’ve been to.",1
"If i could give 0 star i would have. So disgusting how they treats the patients over the phone they advise me to come and stay overnight for checks and test, i have waited for 4 hours and nobody seen me. I wish people improved the service !!",1
"I had a really nasty accident on Saturday early evening, everyone from the NHS cyclist(Rafi) to the ambulance guys(Ben and James, and a third gentleman) and Holli and the lovely Scottish guy who eventually stitched up my head, were incredibly reassuring in a time of stress. I can't say enough good things about you all, thank you for everything!!!",5
"Been to this hospital for twice for my 1 month baby, seen under 3 hours which is excellent for A&E service treatment and compared to other hospitals I've been to. Staff are very caring and detailed and kept me in the loop at all times.",5
Went for a blood test - test happened on schedule with no long waits. Receptionist was friendly. Nurse was friendly and efficient at taking my blood - only one try needed to get the blood 👍,5
"As a tourist I felt very sick and went to A&E on Sunday. The doctor and nurse were all friendly and professional. They took good care of me, really appreciated.",5
"Spent 3 1/2 months here following a severe motorcycle accident in December 2008 (was one of the patients on the BBC documentary Medic One about the London Air Ambulance Service). The medical staff were excellent and did a wonderful job - conscientious, dedicated and helpful. Consequently as an Alumna of Queen Mary University (the feeder university for the Barts Health NHS Trust) I have since become a patient trustee of the trust and my partner has chosen the same hospital for her medical treatment since moving to London. If you are in an accident or have a medical condition that requires a diligent medical team to diagnose or treat I cannot recommend this hospital highly enough.",5
On the 2nd of September I went to the emergency department because I broke my finger and I told the I was going on holiday in 2 days time. I follow the procedures they told me to do than when I came back from holiday there were nothing waiting for me. Last Sunday on the 1st of October I went there to find out what shall I do to take the dressing off my finger and have some after care and they told me because they need to phone me to book a time to do that. I feel they don't really care what happens to me. I have been waiting for 2 days for this phone call and nothing has happened. I should have had the dressing removed yesterday..... feel very disappointed. I just want to make sure my finger is ok and what shall I do to get it moving again.,1
I can't say the whole a & e is rubbish but I broke a tiny bone below my knuckle. I had to wait hours to put a cast on. The staff one minute put a splint on my hand the next a cast. They were evidently confused. They told me that it would take 1 and a half weeks to heal and that they would check up every now and then. After two weeks I call them and the say that I have to wait another week. My cast is inefficient and old. They don't really care. It is pathetic.,1
"Will write a review on behalf of my girlfriend...

Back in September 2014 she went to a hospital with one of her friends complaining to the doctor that her back hurts and she thinks this might be something to do with her kidney.

Doctor didn't do any tests and said she must have stretched her back and that's the reason it hurts.
Luckily pain went away after few days. And she forgot about it...

12 Feb 2015 we went on holiday for a week. In the middle of the week she felt something was wrong, because she had to rush to the toilet few times in an hour with pains.

20 Feb 2015 we got back to London. After long flight we decided to have a nap. When we woke up, it was ~10PM. My GF said she is feeling huge pain in her back and asked to go to the hospital. Called the taxi and we went to 'Royal London Hospital' because it was the closest one where we live.

After waiting for 40-60min in reception we heard our name and what a coincidence - same doctor from September 2014 welcomed us. He was rude, my GF could barely walk because of the pain and again he said - you must have stretched your back (!!). We were trying to convince him it is not. Luckily - he got a great idea that it might be kidney infection/stones and offered blood/urine test.

They took her to a room and gave painkillers which helped a lot - she didn't feel the pain anymore. After ~3 hours of waiting, doctor came with results (yey!) and said she has urine infection and there is nothing to worry about kidney. He gave 6 tablets of some medicine saying 2 a day and you should be fine after 3 days.

Finally, at 3AM we were let go (21 Feb 2015). After few hours of sleep, my GF woke up at ~8:30AM saying the same pain came back even though she drank the tablets. She started vomiting I called 'The Royal London Hospital' and explained about yesterday's situation and they told me to call 111 (NHS)... After calling NHS and explaining what's going on, they said to wait a call back. I ran to boots to get some painkillers, by the time I came home, my GF had a call from GP nearby and we were told to go to St Pancras hospital, from there we were taken to 'University College Hospital'. After inspection she was diagnosed with urine infection which went up to her kidney. She stayed in hospital for 3 days (2 days with drip in her vein). Now she is feeling way better. Amazing doctors at UCLH. Massive thanks to these guys.

Avoid 'Royal London Hospital'. Such a bad experience. Go to UCLH - they will take care of you",1
"A waste of time...

I went there today for the second time in 2 weeks with the same infected toe, then a foot doctor told me ""In the NHS system you need to go to the GP and then he will send you to a foot doctor"" (A Foot doctor told me this).

Which made me wonder what is the point of having a foot doctor on emergency when apparently I need to waste a day of work to go to the GP, then waste another day to go to the foot doctor which was telling me this.

Completely useless, not seeking to solve anything and just remediate your problems and pass to someone else. A very arrogant lady was very proud to tell me she was the foot doctor but at the same time was quick to say she couldn't solve the problem right there and then. That i should perhaps let is infect further and then go see her again.

Why do what you can do today when you can do it in 2 weeks time and waste time and money of the citizens that pay your salary.",1
"Had gamma knife surgery myself in 2000,  well run hospital and surprisingly clean for such an old building.  My son well cared for in the new building at present.  A well maintained new hospital that I think will still look new in the decades to come.",5
"For the past couple of years my daughter has been a inpatient when unwell due to ongoing respiratory detoriation in the 7E ward, and mainly under the care of Dr Chin Nwokoro. I can not find the words to describe what an amazing consultant Dr Chin has been in getting my daughter home, and supportive during some very difficult moments. Pediatric nurses do very good job here and are very caring. #helpushelpyou",5
Huge thank you to Mercy from the psychiatric liaison team who made the worst night of my life better. Without mercy I would be in much worse place. Thank you Mercy!,5
"If you ever have to go for an follow up x-ray be prepared to wait 2-3 hours. They give you an appointment time just for a laugh, because it's meaningless. You'll see people come in after you and leave before you.",1
"All too easy to knock the NHS but when they get it right I feel privlaged to live in a country where we have a health service , my current health issue has been sent with attentively and the consultant I met instil me with confidence. The telephone and postal communications and timeline have been spot on. I know it doesn't always work this well but it's a huge under resourced service and I hope we never lose it.",5
"kids ward are the best especially a great lady called Angelika she is so proffessional,helpful,cheerful she is the best ever",5
"Do not deserve one star, avoid at all costs, money and target hungry, no human approach, lazy and disrespectful doctors, nurses and others. Have to spent 3 days with druggies in a same room. No respect for patient, privacy invasion. very unprofessional",1
"Attended the children dental this morning, and the Lady On the door screening was on her mobile having a conversation on her earpiece, not interested if I had any covid symptoms, extremely unprofessional!!

To identify the Lady, as you entered the building she was sat on the left-hand side.",1
"Very impressive, all the staff were fantastic, can not be faulted, naming Lucy  Famila and Jana and all I have not mentioned .thank you for all your professional  treatment, one of your recent patients  David Baker,And stay safe during these Covid times worth ten stars.",5
"My first baby girl born in 23rd July 2022, special thanks to Silvia and 8B all team. Thank you RLH and NHS",5
My partner went to Royal London on 3rd December. Within 7 days they  lost the results of vital medical tests and no one is taking responsibility to sort the mess out. When I put this on their website they refused to allow the comments to be published.,1
"Dr Frances Hughes is operating here, she's not just the Best surgen in the country, but a very kind soul who does everything she can to make sure you get through with the operation and recovery.",5
"Went to a&me department having been coughing up blood following an endoscopy operation at whipps cross hospital, the doctors here told me to rinse my mouth out with corsydol antiseptic mouthwash wash!!! And sent me away... turned out I had severe h.pylorise stomach infection inflamed stomach and gastritis, needed three types of medication at the same time and I'm still not 100% terrible....",1
My uncle 98 a fit man when he went in was neglected he had sugars of 33 and then 18 they did not even tell him his supper was on his table which by the way he couldn't reach as they didn't pull the table across for him and even the ordinary man on the street knows you have to eat I made them get him a sandwich I wouldn't give them a kick up the rear let alone a raise,1
"Found the staff to be welcoming, supportive and friendly. Overall I had a positive response, fantastic advice, great experience and excellent interaction with Dr Jorge who's very much helpful, likely understanding and kindly attentive.",5
My I took my son to this hospital after he suffered from an epitaxisx at school. I found the staff at reception helpful we didn't have to wait too long to see a doctor waiting at children's A&E. They dealt with my sons issue promptly,5
"I'm extremely disappointment with the service. Waited about an hour to be seen and no check ups but been given a number to call  a GP to book an appointment. Described the nurse I have clear symptoms of a whooping cough, uncontrolled choking cough, gasping for air but she did not take me seriously.",1
"I am always amazed every time I use this hospital. From the reception staff and porters to nurses and doctors. Everyone is so helpful, so friendly and makes what is often an unpleasant situation so much easier.",5
"It was ten years ago that I came here for a brain x-ray and I was appointed to come to view these with an asian doctor. When I did I was told to walk by a kiosk where I did see some scruffy old hag serving there and when she saw me proceeded to clip me round the ear like one would do to some rough tearaway that did bad and not listen to what he was told. I think it was for this that I was asked to come here...
The second time I came here it was for a skin complaint and was seen by a competent Doctor that prescribed me cream..then after I was sent a letter to see a female Doctor that said to me a most peculiar thing was as follows:""It's the women ,go somewhere else....!""
All the time I could only see one third of her face as she concealed her identity. She sat in front of me at her desk which was against a wall and there was another man listening in...
Having visited and been here a few times I must say I have never felt safe here and feel uneasy at having to attend.. The staff have a terrible reputation and that I will never trust them..I would much rather go somewhere else.. Do the lottery !!! If win ,go private..!!!",2
Impossible to get through in the next 5 minutes. You have to wait around 10minuites before the phone is answered.,1
"I was treated by an amazing doctor last Sunday evening... Her name was REBECCA EXLEY she kept me calm after I had an accident and fixed my face up with 12 stitches which is healing up nicely... Can you please let her know I left a review as I promised i would do... Also the ""i want great care"" needs to be easier to be able to leave a review.

Kind regards
Markus Roberts-Clarke 🤗",5
"Nurses are getting lazy, some of the nurse of 9f and 9e are very rude. They always say they have priorotise in other word , they have licence to kill people who can not talk. They are ignoring asian patients.",1
"We visited royal London hospital 8c maternity ward for my wife's treatment. We admitted into ward 15:00 had to wait 5/6 hours to start treatment. Very rude nurses. If you ask any question answer is always no, they don't know nothing.
Won't visit again",1
"STEALING IN X RAY ROOM

My very ill grandmother has visited this hospital in Ward CDU today and whilst going in for an X Ray has had £60 stolen from her purse (the only notes she had in there.) THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE when going in for an X Ray. She came back and her money had been stolen. I’d hate to think that this is a member of staff and may be an evil patient but please be careful when taking in cash and leaving your purse or wallet laying around in this hospital !!!",1
"Dr Raj Ragoowansi, Consultant upper limb & plastic surgeon ordered to discontinue my mother's physio treatment as we complained about the rude behaviour of one of his staff. The Spanish physio female was quite aggressive too. The referral to Dr Ben Turner Consultant Neurologist was futile as well as the neurophysiologist (Bengali Dr) who conducted an NCS test on her but evaded any responsibility when she suffered severe side effects of this. Typical. The only reason I've rated this as 2* is because certain other departmental experiences were better. No one cares about the patient anymore - inc the GMC: just covering each other's backs for vested institutional interest.",2
Long waiting not a good service and doctors took too long after 1 patient to another hell of waiting even if u r next to be called,1
"Great hospital but the waiting time is bad, 3 hours here for just 4 appointments in the children's district! And on the lift only specific lifts go to specific floors, ask a member of staff to get to locked floors.",4
I am writing this on behalf of my wife who at present is in the hospital after a major operation to remove a cancer tumor in her pancreas.  We both speak very highly of the surgeon  who did the operation and the care that she is getting whilst in recovery on the ward . We still have a way to go to get her home but tanks to the care she is getting hopefully that will be soon.,5
"Pathetic service from the TB department. Patient diagnosed  3 weeks ago and still hasn't received their medication, emails sent by other consultants, even from differrent hospital  that the patient attended in A& E  due to TB complication and  still nothing. Worst service ever!",1
"😊Been a patient here on & off since a child and it's always been a joy using this hospital, very pleasant and polite staff, no long waiting times and amazing refurbishments! I do wish this was my local hospital and would recommend & suggest it to anyone.",4
"Ward 12 c they did an amazing job the doctors are fantastic but the pharmacy is very slow at dispensing medicine after being discharged .
I mean really slow. Waited for 36 hours .",5
Had a minor procedure at the day centre. Wow! Such amazing care by staff. Thank you!,5

"Just got back home from Whitechapel hospital A&E. I'm very grateful for the amazing service I've received. It is a busy unit, however it is run very well. Staff extremely professional and most importantly caring. I felt looked after. Thank you",5
"Unit Facilities
Restaurant on level 5 of main tower. Costa coffee shop in foyer in Whitechapel Rd entrance. (plans for more but building work still on-going). No cash-point facilities. Plenty of shops and mini super markets , markets and restaurants all around Whitechapel . All main banks along Whitechapel Rd.
3 Rooming in rooms for parents of the main ward with The Children’s Trust able to accommodate parents that have to travel a distance and/or have a very sick baby/child.",5
"This colorectal clinic is appalling, the doctors who carried out the colonoscopy didn't wait for the sedation to kick in an the patient was in horrendous pain and traumatised from the memory of the probing. Was crying with pain and the doctors told her to stop crying or she would not get her treatment. A clinic Operating at a third world standard in London!",1
Terrible service. I collapsed on the floor and no one helped me in the urgent medical centre. They said I still have to wait. There is no urgency in the urgent medical centre. Something is terribly wrong with the current system under which they operate.,1
Worse hospital ever. Waited from 10 am till 8 pm only to be told to go home. Absolutely rude staff. I’m so angry right now.,1
"This 1* rating isn't a knock on the A&E service itself but the telephone operators who conduct themselves in disgusting fashion. It's an absolute atrocity that when I called in to ask a query, they cut me off midway through my sentence and shut the query down all in itself. Please train your staff to have some manners and be a little more sympathetic. Wouldn't even treat my enemy the way they treated me over the phone.",1
"The doctor didn't even checked my finger and just put a dress on that I could have done my self. After 4h waiting on Tuesday he asked me to come back but probably he forgot to book the appointment that he gave, so after 3h more waiting in 2 different cues I decided to walk out as this is ridiculous. The finger has been bleeding out even after the doctor's treatment .. chose another hospital if the problem is serious. Attached are the pictures of my finger that as been cut from a slicer",1
"My family member was Royal London for a few weeks and was given the best care possible. Especially wards 13C and 12F, they were on call and on point if anything changed. I take my hat off to these wards. Thank You!!!",5
"I have been to this hospital a few times, it is always top class, although very busy at times you never have to wait too long, the staff have always been good, we need to praise our NHS",5
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE HOSPITAL! WORST IVE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE. THEY HAD A 4 YEAR OLD WAITING FOR 5 HOURS AND ALSO SAID THEY HAVE NO BLANKETS FOR HIM. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS DONT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL WASTE OF TIME. AWFUL AWFUL SERVICE FROM THE BALD RECEPTIONIST TOO NOT HELPFUL AND JUST RUDE PERIOD. NOT SURE IF HE THINKS HE OWNS THE HOSPITAL,1
I work there as ECA Ambulance,5

Instead of proper treatment, CT scan, they had tried to find her sick for Covid-19.",2
Incredible service. Went quickly from triage in to X-ray then got treated within 80 mins. Doctor Kat was wonderful and took great care of me. Thank you all.,5
"Emergency service was great today! ♥️ Thank you so much for you amazing help 😊
Dr & nurses, everyone who has been working on the shift around 12.30 to 7pm were great 🏅😉😁",5

P.S. I may be biased because  work there.",5
"Father, please bless and keep safe London ambulance service staff,also all Royal hospital Whitechapel staff and more important all blood donors! And thank you for leaving me alive!....again. 🙏",5
"Racist behaviour from the main receptionist !

We went to Royal London Hospital for our scheduled appointment. Upon approach the main reception to ask for direction, we were shouted at, telling by the Pakistani receptionist guy to stay away at least 2 metres from him. Is it typical to shout at patients in this hospital ?

While waiting at the bench, we noticed several East Asian looking patients were given the same treatment by the same Pakistani receptionist guy, whereas other white patients were not.

Hence, we had no reasonable assumptions, but to conclude that such receptionist is racist !",1
The hand cleaning pump on the wall is full of germs on the second floor.And doctors often uses you as a guinee pig in front of students without asking for your permission.I came across some good doctors in there as well.Needs improvement.,2
"N.H.S. working hard (for minimum wage!) I am TRULY grateful for our NHS,they really are life savers & not appreciated by the powers that be!!",5
"The royal London treatment and looked after me very well when I was in, in October I did stay there for far too long but all the doctors and nurses were all SO caring and kind.",5
Great hospital. Major stroke and trauma centres. Good for outpatient services as well,5
"Doctors very self centric (I am the doctor, you are no one) and very judgemental. Nurses slightly racists. No one knows anything, I hope my child would never need their help again!!",1
"Complete rubbish. I came in with what could have been a heart attack, and I felt like I was interrupting something. I thought I was going to die in some god forsaken corridor, and the staff were just standing around chatting. Absolutely bloody disgraceful.

The young lady who did finally help me was fantastic, but the rest were very condescending and rude.",1
"Dewhurst the butchers are alive and well and can be found in the dental dept at this hospital. I had a tooth pulled by two students, after 45 mins of tugging and pulling they had to call for help. when the main dentist came he pulled it in about 10 seconds. I understand students need to learn with practical work but so did the hangman at Pentonville prison, more supervision for students and a bit of TLC for the people they experiment on.",3
I have just spent an hour trying to get through to clinical  haematology- the switch board is sooo incompetent! I was passed from laboratory to phlebotomist and one switch board operator even told me there’s no clinical hematology department and even insisted that the consultant i was after did not exist! Wow. Frustrated and fed up I will let the Gp try and get through.,1
"Great hospital probably the best in London especially for Max-Facs.
Most staff are helpful.
Cannot fault overall.",5
I was very worried about a serious skin allergy and called the emergency service. I received a call back from the doctor that asked me to go to Royal London hospital GP out of hour service so  he would visit me. Had a really good experience.,5
My mother was supposed to have teeth extracted but they got the wrong file so wasted journey and whole of her morning. The CONSULTANT mistook my mothers name for her dentists name. No wonder the NHS is in a mess.,1
Julie Williams of the Triage/Labour Ward went above and beyond to help me today . Very much appreciated and people like you should be cherished by the NHS. Thank you again for everything today.,5
Great Head and Neck staff! Very dedicated and patient-centered care.,5
"The NHS is a jowel, they truly are heroes. The dental department here, however, should train their employees on how to deal with people. Especially the doctors.",1
Extremely rude staff. Why do they work there if they are miserable? Don't they care about sick patients? Just called to change my appointment and I had an arrogant staff talk to me and she hung up on me as well. I will make a formal complaint.,1

"they bring me back to life after my motorcycle accident. huge thanks to specially maxfax, Mr.Holmes team, if i am alive it is just because of them ! phoneline is a bit horrible, only thing they say is ` one moment`  in really aggresive way, someone should tell them they are picking up phones for help us, not for being rude and aggresive. I wish if my local hospital would be good as royal london hospital.",5
Very friendly staff and short waiting time! I had a pleasant experience,5

"This hospital has take over my home care medications from my local pharmacy, They told me that this is to saves them money, however they never send my prescription on time to there choice of pharmacy and I can’t travel to them as its is 2 hours drive, I have run out of my medication for my heart and kidny transplant  and they have neglected my wellbeing and put my life at risk several times just to save some money, I was never out of medication before until London Royal Hospital from Harefield, LRH do not even getting back to me when I leave messages on there phone, I want my other hospital to take over again asap.",1
Doesn't deserve even 1 star!!! I am very disappointed from the staff of 8F maternity!! I will write it again VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  Not professional and rude staff of Midwife!!,1

"It doesn’t get better.
In conjunction with the LAA and Emergency they hv literally saved my life twice (driven by my wife).
If you are going to the RLH you are v v v lucky",5

"We have been received great care from the nursing staff and the doctors. They were very helpful and happy to help

My mum just spent nearly 4 weeks in the hospital the doctors nurses and all the staff were fantastic the care and dedication  is totally  awesome  thank you wards 3f 5e and 14f,5
I’m very happy with this hospital and their services. I can compare easily with Whipscross and Homerton but it’s far better service and staffs are very helpful. I really appreciate their hard work looking after my family.,5
this review is just to point out the fact the person who is trying to play the race card needs to wind their neck in and re word there review as the colour of their skin probably had absolutely nothing to do with how you were treated.,5
"Spanking new building and great healthcare service, but... Yes there's always a but, the queues for teas are long and you'll really have fun getting from one location to another using designated lifts only! Believe me a when I say you are in a 3d Rubiks cube!",3

Went to the urgent care centre here after being told to after calling 111. 5 hours later the uninterested doctor told me he couldn't do anything for me unless I needed surgery! So don't bother going in unless there unless you specifically need surgery haha,1

Mark",5
"the worst hospital, the unprepared, incompetent staff, I'm only talking about the emergency service, you have every chance of dying in the hospital👎👎👎👎👎👎Very careful",1
Shocking telephone service. Mid conversation had the fone put down on me. I needed to go for xrays urgently as I hurt my ribs. Absolutely no help at all.,1
"Emergency service, waiting time 5 hours",1
"Doctors that use google for a diagnosis ,keeps you in a Queue for 3 hours then tell you that they can’t do it and send you to another department to queu for another 3 hours ,they just making themselves a job they don’t do",1
Just came to see Professor Graham Foster - a real gentleman- really really helpful. Kind of a Doctor who makes patient 80% better already. God bless Professor Foster - thanks very much.,5

Long waiting for the emergency treatment centre.Need to be quick.,4
It's disgraceful how they cut you off when you try to get information for a test you have done more than a month ago (no results yet?). I tried to call a second time and now nobody answers. Strange they were there 4 minutes ago. Very bad imaging department,1
"Nice clean hospital, most staff are caring... sometimes some night nurses neglect patients and make ALOT of noise not caring that patients are sleeping.",4
"In the Children's department, ward 7F Amazing care, excellent staff, good cleaning and service. Thank you so much! Bless you.",5
"Very bad communication, and you have to repeat your story a million times because you don't get seen by the same doctor twice. They don't tell you what's going on, and they really don't care- you are treated like a number.",2
I was staying in he hospital for a fulf month Andi have to say the hospital is amazing the staff was great and they treated me Really well. I highly recommend this hospital as I think is one of the best in London by my own experience,5
Have absolutely nothing bad to say about the NHS ever after a family member was sent here. The staff and facilities are top class.,5
Horrific waiting after 5 hours still waiting for blood tests results 😔😔,2
"terrible incompetence from having to go in twice for 2 wizdom teeth that could and should of been taken out 1st time, 2 appointments for the same thing for a sliped disk more waist of time and money now ok understaffed we all know why but makeing pople leave a 2 year old and a 4 year old at seperate occations outside the wards because they were not partiners....well what words can you use for this.",1

Mum had a Tumour removed and it's changed since the old place. The new building is great and the stuff are kind ( Nurses),5

It's a shame I couldn't give less than 1 star! Terrible service!! Horrible Drs in accident and emergency! One in particular sent me away in severe pain and showed no compassion and no care what so ever.,1
Can't believe it! My man was at this hospital and yesterday night she was so sick and she was calling the nurse and they were not listening  just ignoring my nan my mum had to call the nurse to actually GET THEM TO GO TO HER ROOM horrible nurses they are probably racist nurses stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid nurses,2
6 hours and still waiting... Broken limbs and still being prioritised after drunk people who sprained their ankles. A&E is abysmal and should be avoided,1
I have seen a lot of racism here in this hospital it’s very sad. I would not recommend the emergency department,1
The doctors and nurses need to realise they are paid by We the People and stop being rude unhelpful towards patients and visitors and the pharmacist is a joke waited 7 hours for medication had to leave the hospital before it came I would say it's is possible .that the Royal London is the worst Hospital in London within the NHS never thought Homerton hospital would be better then any hospital in London but it is,1
"Listen to your patients’ needs and respect them, that would be highly appreciated please and thank you.",1
Super nice hospital royal london hospital it's most beautiful hospital in london excellent but??? I have some bed experience with staff labor suit omg there service if you don't go there you don't understand their responsibilities there talk so rude with patients it's shameful for NHS I think need some experience staff,4

I went urgent dental care but all they told me to go find a dentist for my self and they didnt even see me i told them im in a very bad pain couldnt sleep they said they cant do nothing well this aint finish here,1
Who hires these people?? UTC is an absolute joke. I waited for almost 3 hours and they just told me to take a paracetamol.,1
Everyone who works on the NHS frontline need to appreciated for what they do but the service you get here is not good because they are soo desperately stretched..,3
"Extremely disappointed with the service, as usual. Staff at reception is rude, letters for appointments never arrive, you are told someone will call you for an appointment and no one ever does, they book you appointments without notifying you.",1
"Great hospital very efficency good care. Parking along side streets is adequate.
Reasonable wait for appointment time. Overall happy.",5
I had to go to A&E last night. The staff was very efficient and friendly and was seen quickly.,5
My daughter was taken here on Thursday after been hit by a car she went over the bonnet onto the ground and they only xrayed her leg no where else and then sent her home with no painkillers etc hence the next day the pain was coming out more she feels like she has broken ribs as it is very swollen and painful surely after being hit by a car the least they should have done was given her a full body xray,1
My 90 year old father had an appointment today there was no wheelchairs available.   Disgusting!,1

"Amazingly run, organised hospital. All the staff were extremely nice and took extra care.",5
It is the best hospital that I have ever seen. Here doctors treat the patients with love and care. I have no words to say but seriously I want to recommend this hospital.,4

"After watching the BBC News on Tuesday it certainly makes it look as though this hospital values"" dignity"" over anything else. Extremely worrying.",1
"all flawless during my stay. everyone very professional, caring. thank you very much! 5 stars!",5
Ridiculous amount of time waiting! Waited 4.5 hours because there was ‘one’ doctor and it wasn’t even that busy! NHS needs a lot of improvement!!!!,1
Great service at this hospital....staff are really helpful and friendly. Facilities are excellent and general surroundings are modern and pleasant.,4
Pathetic policies (changing daily and subject to nurses’ own discretion) and bad service.,1
"very bad experience ,i had a big knee problem the doctor didn't know how diagnosethe entity telling just youself to rest.
CHANGE THE JOB (DOCTOR)",1
"Can not commend enough the NHS considering the many restrictions, the care they provide is truly a blessing.",5

"They don’t allow visitors due to covid, but they don’t have good management of answering calls. I cannot get through to the ward because they don’t pick up the phone!!",1
Private sector and ENT dont pick the phone up been calling since 9am and when speak to switch board they all give me dofferent numbers  terrible customer service. They dont exsist.,1
I spent 2 months here after breaking my spine and I must say it is a very trendy hospital lovely staff and brilliant surgeons God bless nhs,5
All staff are totally overworked. They can't cope with communications between doctors and office staff. A few of the staff are miserable and one or two even rude,2
"Help mum get a kidney transplant sorted, love the NHS 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5
They looked after me very well no complaints they helped me.they cut off my toes..and maybe my whole foot as well.do not know yet will do tomorrow.,3
Staff are really interactive kind and honest to people they give you a wide range of foods from breakfasts to Dinner.,5
"Amazing, kind doctors who treat you the best they possibly could. Best hospital in the whole of Tower Hamlets.",5
They said they would call me but still have not within 2 hours. If it was an emergency someone could be dead.,1
Couldn't find a wheelchair,3
I just called A&E in a professional capacity and am really shocked at the abrupt and impolite manner of the young man who took my call  if I was a worried relative I would complain  it isn't good enough.,1
"Unqualified docs. After he found a pain came from the kidney he wait for xray he found nothing expected just a  little constipation ,he said a pain came from a constipation ..hahahah .",1

The receptionist at emergency ward are so bad they are very rude and have no people skills how on earth can a hospital employ people like that,1
This hospital has moved from its old historic building to a new and much more modern building. The level of service in this hospital is much better compared to other nhs hospitals,5
I just wanted to say a big thank u to all staff on ward 3D the job u guys do is over and above I was looked after from the moment I was put on the ward and all night are my operation ...big thanks,5
Was waiting in the discharge area for more then 4 hours just to get the medication so we could leave no organisation no communication awful service,1
Receptionist at the A&E department needs better training. Maybe first step is to train their manners.,1
People working there do evil things to children under disguise of good! BE AWARE!,1

"Hi

The Royal London Hospital.,5
I fractured my wrist. Was in and out of a&e within 2 hours. They reviewed my x-ray the next day and decided I needed a cast. They booked me in 9am the next morning. Super organised and helpful.,5
"Experience in the pediatric emergency room on Sunday. Super doctor. Young, kind, very good, she took care of and kept my son under observation until he was really better. Many families waiting but followed quickly thanks to the organization of the nurses, the doctor, unfortunately for her, was only one in the entire department. Thanks again for everything.",5
"Mediocre to the point of bad. The care given to a family member admitted there has been very poor, some members of the healthcare staff do not have adequate training. When I asked the doctor on duty to come and treat my relative, the nurse's response was that he had gone home because he was tired. It may be due to the strike taking place at this time but the hospital management should have provided minimum services and improved the situation of the staff on duty. Many state-of-the-art heliports but basic service does not reach an acceptable level.",2
"Amazing hospital. Excellent service, fast, courteous, thorough and caring. Even the food is delicious. I came broken and they repaired me and for free. I recommend it to anyone who is debating",5
"Came to the emergency room to have surgery for appendicitis. The operation took place after 3 days (which is a very long time when you are in pain and don't understand much English 😅). However, the quality of care and the kindness of the professionals (from all services) allowed me to have a stay in the best conditions. And for that, I thank all the teams.",5
" I have had 2 bad experiences in this hospital. Honestly, I am very disappointed in this hospital. For my part, I will not set foot in that place again, neither in emergencies with my children nor when it is time for me to have my baby.",1
" Thanks to the fantastic emergency room doctors who eliminated my father at the speed of light, raising the banal suspicion of gastritis without even doing an exam.

Thanks to you, my father almost died two days later, having undergone emergency surgery for sepsis caused by haemoperitoneum due to a ruptured gallbladder.
A sepsis that had been going on for days, associated with the pain that, although it had never gone away even after the morphine injections you gave him, you underestimated the gravity of the situation by sending it back to the sender.

Worthy of a third world hospital

Long live Italian healthcare

I love Brexit

Thanks to the fantastic E.D. physicians who cleared my father at the speed of light by placing the suspicious trivial of a gastritis without even examining it.

Thanks to you, my father was almost dying two days later, urgent for a sepsis caused by a hemoperitoneal bleeding due to the breakthrough of the gallbladder.
A sepsis that has been going on for days, associated with the pain that even though it did not even after the injections of morphine you did, you underestimated the severity of the situation by sending it back to the sender.

Worthy then a Third World Hospital",1
"Disastrous. My sister-in-law gave birth there and I thought she was dying. 40 hours after her water broke and no doctor came to see her, we demanded it several times. They said that if green liquid came out, let them know!!!! outrageous! Until he started vomiting and then they woke up. Mediocre, I don't recommend it to anyone.

In English: MEDIOCRE. DISASTROUS",1
"Doctors and nurses are very good, but the waiting time is relatively long",4
" It was my first time and I had a good impression. Very nice staff. If you compare Newham Hospital and Royal Hospital, these are two big differences.",5
"Very sick people. Big tails. The staff is always polite and kind, they work very quickly and pay attention to everyone. I admire them.",3
 I gave birth in that hospital and I really loved the treatment they gave me. The midwives were great.,5
"We only saw the facade under construction!
Good sign since we are tourists and staying next door
We also heard lots of sirens! And saw helicopters",3
Don't have,5
"The management level is high, the equipment is advanced, and the service is excellent. I hope China will catch up soon.",5
"I received good treatment here, thank you to my doctors and nurses.",5
In this hospital in 1994 scenes of the film Captives with Tim Roth were shot,4
I had a total transplant for my father and I want to go for tests. Please help,5
" 12th floor.
The nurses are angels 👼
They have treated me with great affection.
Thank you 🙏🏽",5
Resolved the pain I had arrived with but without understanding the cause.,3
It is a state-of-the-art hospital..... very good care,5
Bad hospital. We waited 4 hours and I'm still waiting,1
It's a pretty lousy hospital.,2
FOR ITS ACCURATE LOCATION REPORT AND ITS EASE OF GETTING AROUND.,5
Suitable for circumcision,3
Help was provided very quickly,5
Long wait for an appointment,3
Quite a hospital,3
Definitely good,5

"We didn't stop for food as it was a bit cramped,  not the sitting out side weather the staff were not too acomadating either , I wish that if you don't aim to please or it's just a job ,then don't work in a pub or shop , I've worked with the public most of my working life so , I get why staff can be abit off but we are not all the same .",3
"Always busy. Nice location.
Wouldn't want to spend more than an hour in there. Feels very dated inside.",3
"The restuarant had a limited menu so I only had a sandwich, wrong day we went to eat.",3
"Bog standard breakfast, nice and tasty but quite cold and had to ask for my sausages, which were missing. Cheap amd cheerful, you know what to expect.",3
Ok  not the best of weatherspoons but ok feels a bit crowded trying to fit to many tables in the space,3
"Actually like this spoons, rarely eat at spoons, never have at this one until this time I had bbq chicken pizza with a friend and we both had food poisoning. Bad. (and no I wasn't drinking) I notified them and got sent a questionnaire via email (don't know if from spoons or a health whatsit) but they wouldn't acknowledge my reply hense the feedback so nothing got done about it.
Lovely place for a pint on a sunny day, just don't eat the food. Enjoy.",3
"Cheap and cheerful place.
Good service.",3
"I went here during the Eat Out To Help Out scheme and expectedly it was very busy. Social distancing wasn't excellent but was satisfactory. The meal took a long time to arrive compared to other Wetherspoons I've previously been to. They also had a very limited menu at the time but with the pandemic, I feel that is understandable. I had a burger here and it was as expected compared to other spoons. Cheap and cheerful food so no complaints whatsoever really. I may come here again as it's not a bad place but if busy, maybe best to consider alternatives.",3
"Food and drink is fine and quick for the price, however nothing special. Can get quite noisy and there are always lots of flies in the restaurant. Would recommend for a fast meal but sit outside away from the flies.",3
"Not a bad Wetherspoons, table wasn't clean but got served pretty quickly.
Not the largest of pubs but at least you don't need a 1000 steps to go to the toilet as it's actually on the same level.",3
"Ordered food and it came within 10 minutes, but pizza was not hot and was not pre-cut. Little bits of pepperoni and too much cheese. Only rating this 3 out of 5 stars and not 1 star because the food came quickly and pub was in a good state. Also the staff were very friendly.",3
"Fast service, good price but below average quality and quantity.
Not a very nice atmosphere in here.",3
"Our food was lovely but my daughters buttermilk chicken burger was frozen in the middle,  which out me off eating my meal  Refund was given and she chose a pudding as she didn't want the meal replacing  she hasn't been sick so that's a bonus. First problem ever at a weatherspoons.",3
"Typical whethers. . Just went for girlie drinks on a cold November Friday evening.  Wasn't too busy, staff were welcoming and friendly.  I can imagine one would get a completely different feel about the place on a barmy summer afternoon. ... sitting outside overlooking the canal.  There is parking which is accessed off the road by The Brierley Hop Pole, it's a one way system so when you leave you'll come out near dreams the bed store.",3
"Waterside views, otherwise exactly what you would expect from a chain pub.",3
A fairly standard Wetherspoons pub with food. Separate entrance and exit with more adult customers than the usual clientele. Little evidence of tables being wiped done after each customer. Food pretty standard fare. Close to canal with outdoor seating. Hand sanitisers near entrance and toilets. Social distancing practiced.,3
"It's a shame really, they forgot to put sausages on 2 breakfasts, the extra mushrooms on one ended up on the side of a sausage sandwich and the lake of bean juice drowning each plate was tragic. The beans were literally lost in the depths. Would still eat here as it's a 'Spoons but would be more critical at the time.",3
Food was OK. Small portions though. Staff very friendly and chatty. Was very noisy.,3
"Difficult to order my specific drink on the app, staff friendly and tried to help but still couldn't order the drink I wanted. Nice hot food though,",3
Pretty small as weatherspoons go. Had a full English which wasn't bad but the eggs were very rubbery,3
"Came to this establishment as we usually do on Tuesday 13 03 2018 for a steaknite only to find they no longer do steaknite on Tuesday to cost affective so we won't be going there no more on Tuesday , mostly burgers and pizzas now sorry but not our scene ?????",3
Food hot arrived quickly used the app.A pity the staff not about outside to take orders as quite a few people still going to the bar,3
"Not the most ""homely"" of Wetherspoon pubs you will ever go to with quite a cold, almost drab atmosphere. Menu and drinks as per the rest of the chain.",3
"Staff friendly , dinner times between 12 noon and 2pm will end up queuing due to people buying tea or coffee drinks. Need staff working during busy lunch tie period",3
Went there yesterday not to many people in orderd 2 deserts and was told none left so just had drinks instead.decore could do with make over  and in all needs a good clean.,3
Quick service and as always a decent standard of food. Ordered through the app however my lunch came out before my drink did.,3
Bar staff to busy talking to each other to notice who is next to be served...then get the drinks wrong🙈,3
Good location but nothing to stand it out from other Wetherspoons and they very often run out of menu items.,3
"First ever visit and the last had a doom bar was disappointed, table was sticky inside of bar was inside of a bar nothing much to write home about",3
Small bar so can take a while to get served. Nice view of the lake outside in summertime with largeish outdoor area.,3
"Not good beer advice from manager ... food would have been exceptional if the chef knew the defenition of ""medium""",3
The coffee was good as always I had toast and jam in came not toasted asked for toast to be done when it came it was cold it was that cold it did not melt the butter I think I am not going to order anything else,3
Location is lovely over looking the canal.. Cheap drinks and food.. Friendly staff..,3
"It's a boozer on the water front, it's a box no atmosphere, but cheap drinks make it worth a visit",3
"Usual wetherspoons fayre,  large oblong room,  lacks character, cheerfull  helpful staff......",3
Can be noisy. Nice setting next to canal. Can get busy when the sun shines,3
A little noisey with young females gone were the days when you could go into a weather spoons for a quiet drink,3
"Wetherspoons pub so beer is good  and cheap.
Not much character to the pub although staff are helpful",3
Small outside space but service was good and food was also pretty good.,3
Last pub still open on the Waterfront... this used to be a place for night life but still OK for a pint by the canal,3
"Waited a lo g time for the food, tepid when received.
Covid compliance v good.",3
"Average pub, nothing special. Rather small. Cheap drinks.",3
Good location for a spoons but not the best actual spoons,3
Weatherspoons but not as good as some I've been to.a few breakfast items were a bit cold and eggs were over done,3
"Another one of Wetherspoons pubs, good service, good food as usual.",3
If you want a quiet place avoid on weekends,3
Just a typical Wetherspoon. Nothing special.,3
"Needs a referb ,food not the best ,staff are polite though ........",3
"Nice place, but everything is closed, only Wetherspoons open",3
Ok breakfast and ok service nothing to shout home about standard.,3
Beautiful venue beautiful scenery nice beer Good Food,3
A nice location in the summer to sit out and enjoy the view of the canal,3
Pints decent and prices are reasonable. Same old spoons,3
Food ok staff very friendly,3
Cheap and cheerful. Quick food service.,3
Lovely place on the waterfront foods ok,3
"Standard Wetherspoons, when I went I couldn't get seated outside the pub garden was always full",3
Nice location. Equally matched with nice staff,3
"It's ok, but you can tell that it's an older Whetherspoons",3
When ordering on the app it can take a while for the drinks to arrive,3
Sitting by staff door very noisy door slamming,3
Dated but food comes quick,3
Shame the outside space is not dog friendly,3
Bit dull inside food was good,3
Needs a revamp looking old and tired.,3
Too many old people,3
Pub okay. Good service,3
It's okay service is good,3
OK but beer not the best,3

As expected,3
The pub was nice but our we had the beef Sunday Roasts where not great. The beef was overcooked and the Yorkshire pudding ls tasted like cardboard. The drinks and the mushroom chilli were better.,3
Food was ok - had a burger and it wasn’t bad. But the service was horrendous: I had a reservation and literally had to walk around and find my own table as no staff seemed available or willing to help. One lady at the bar looked us in the face and actively ignored us when we approached to ask for help. Not coming back,3
"We were seated in the Coach House, and although it was almost empty (it was raining heavily), the food came very late, the service was pretty bad. The waiters were pretty clueless, did not know the price of a pint (it's not shown on the menu, it's around 7,5£ btw). Food was great tho, i don't know if it's worth a visit. You can also pay with cash.",3
"Due to this being the oldest coaching inn  remaining in London, and its location, this place is extremely popular. Lovely to go and see but honestly there's nicer pubs in the area. Especially after being charged £5.20 for a lemonade and blackcurrant which wasn't even a pint.",3
I adored the old authentic building with a wow effect. The food was nice. I especially enjoyed my dessert: was huge and yummy. The waiter was friendly but her mood changed a few times in the course of our dinner: maybe she was just tired. All in all a nice experience.,3
"Beautiful space.. Works well, in any weather.. Drinks are a bit pricy, but great environment.. Massive change of staff since I last visited, new set aren't as friendly.. But a lot of staff were present, which made the service efficient. So despite the day being extremely busy, the waiting was never long.",3
The place is great. Such an amazing courtyard just 5 mins walking from London Bridge station. The rating would go to a much higher number were not for the poor food we got. The halloumi was not nice to eat and the Korean chicken wings were bland with not a pinch of Korean flavour. Would go back for drinks but never to eat a thing there.,3
"Very busy but service was good. Both fish and seafood were off the menu. Rare steak was lukewarm, medium steak had too much grissle. Sauce and chips were warmest.",3
"I must say that staff was very kind and  helpful. St the same time, it was the only positive feeling from the visit. Very expensive without real justification. But people pay as did I. I won't come back",3
"Lovely building but neither food nor service matched it.
If going to the balcony, it does not have the drink selection that the ground floor has",3
"The place overall is really nice, nice beer garden and the pub has character. The staff however non engaging do not attempt any kind of convo other than what you want to drink. Seems to be the london way. Disappointing.",3
"An historic pub, with a classic selection of beers. Food was really tasty. Service was super friendly. They need to do a bit more work on pest control as we did see a few mice.",3
Have been here a couple of times and was really disappointed with the most recent time. Our food and drinks orders were both mucked up (which is no drama) but the way the staff handled it was v v rude. They laughed at us behind our backs and made snarky comments and did the bare minimum to remedy the issues. Such a shame because this is such a lovely place normally.,3
"A unique courtyard environment. Bordered by a National trust property. Food platters weren't great and the service can be slow at peak times, but the large outdoor seating area right next to London Bridge railway station makes this worth the stop.",3
"Very good food, especially burgers and fish & chips. The angry bartender was not impressive and we waited more than an hour for the food to get served.",3
Lovely spot if you fancy a bad pint and a bad attitude 👌🏼,3
"Food was reasonable and service was great, food was classic pub food style and the atmosphere is lively. Lacked something special that I was expecting from the""oldest ale house in London"".

Might come back however wouldn't go out of my way to return.",3
Sharing chicken platter was not enough for 2 people. Food took longer than 20 minutes to be served,3
"I found this place completely by surprise. I was in the area for something different.  As an admirer of old buildings, I was keen to go inside for the meal booked. The building was everything I expected - old, slow, uneven floors and stairs.  Lovely.
Service... that should NOT have reflected the slow and uneven aspect of the George. But it did. We had to FIND staff for the restaurant. Apparently, I was to download an app if I wanted to change mash on an item to chips, according to the member of staff who finally attended us.
The chips were delicious,  the salad- all the oil on a salad had sunk to make an oily bottom - and thanks to totally inflexible staff members, was all I as someone with a dairy allergy could eat as both vegan dishes were heavy on the chilli sauce, and all other dishes were heavy on the dairy. (Which is why I wanted no butter on sandwiches, no mash etc) but after a REAM of excuses why items could not be altered,  I ate chips and salad... again. so nice building. It's a shame about the attitude. Won't be back and WON'T be recommended. Sorry.",3
"Christmas is in full swing in London. We booked a table to eat and my advice would be to do the same if you want to sit down that is. Food was OK (burgers all round) and the chap that ensured our table was ready was on point and helpful. Loads of activity outside in the courtyard. Bar staff had a real job on serving 4-5 deep customers at the bar, but did so expertly. Food is ordered from the bar, so unfortunately you have to queue with everyone else to place your order. Good range of beers and largers. Good location for the Station and across the road from Borough Market.",3
"I went for a drink for a colleague's leaving party. Pleasant service, extremely busy and noisy! Too noisy for me to really enjoy the surroundings. I did not stay to eat therefore, no comments on the food.",3
"I've had a few neutral experiences before which is why I'm giving 3 stars, else I'd only give 2 stars. Service on my last visit was absolutely terrible. Do not go here if you plan on dining. Only 2 bar staff to take all drink orders and food orders. It was so loud there were multiple miscommunication with the staff (the girl was a bit rude tbh). Not ideal and wish I hadn't taken my family here.",3
The cheese first course was amazing. The ciabatta sandwhich was excellent. HOWEVER the burgers can only be gotten well done and they are like like hockey pucks. Beer was good,3
"So I will begin this review by saying that this is a lovely pub with very nice staff. HOWEVER, after the meal I had I felt the need to raise awareness on the quality of the roast provided.

I'll start with the Yorkshire pudding or should I say the burnt Yorkshire disk. I've never experienced food in just 2 dimensions. It was quite surprising how a piece of chicken could be so unbelievably dry, I felt the need to ask for a steak knife. I was initially excited for the cauliflower cheese inclusion into the roast, imagine my disappointment when I was given JUST ONE FLORETT! What a ridiculously unnecessary tease.

I don't really know what they did to the potatoes. It sort of was like they roasted them and then boiled them after. They were not good. The carrots were acceptable and the cabbage was actually the highlight of the meal. Imagine that. Hungover roast on new year's day and cabbage was the highlight.

Chicken 1/10
Cabbage 4/10
Yorkshire disk 1/10
Potatoes 2/10
Carrots 3/10
Gravy 4/10",3
Bit of a meh chain pub with standard London beer prices (which is about £7 a pint in 2023 which is ridiculous) and a menu which was limited by the kitchen running short of certain ingredients (it was anything chicken on the day I visited.) Service was slow but friendly.,3
"Great view of the shard, reasonable London prices but limited seating. Very much the basic pub experience of England.",3
"Come on on a full belly :p It's an excellent pub, great location, and staff. But i can't give a 5-star after having eaten their food. I had there what was probably the worst steak and ale pie I've ever tasted. The burgers my friends ordered also looked gross. All food seems just out of the microwave, but with real food prices. AVOID THE FOOD at all costs!",3
Cool place to hang out but slightly too hectic for me. Also quite expensive. I know it's a good location but other places in the same area aren't all that steep. Fun vibes though.,3
"First of all, I have always loved this pub. It is tucked away off Borough High Street and close to London Bridge and Borough Market.  However, on recent visits I have found the customer service a bit off.",3
"Chicken Kiev was so hard I could not cut it with a knife but had to hold it in my fingers to take a bite.
I was very overcooked .",3
"The pub itself is gorgeous. The food is mediocre, especially for the price (burger and chips of poor quality for £14). The man who served us was the worst part. What a miserable, unfriendly guy.",3
The service is a bit stretched but the place looks really cool! Food was also quite nice,3
"A charming pub in a beautiful old building. But why on earth do they keep doors and windows open in November? I was expecting to be sipping my drink in a warm atmosphere, but ended up wearing my coat the whole time.",3
"Visited 31/7/21. Five people. Unique and lovely National Trust pub. Greene King run. Beers and Ales were well kept but pricey, even for London. Lunch was excellent overall. However, the mash with my sons steak and kidney pudding was very poor, clearly reheated and completely bland. Surely better quality mash could be sourced.
Sorry to say that the male toilets in the pub were really mucky and tatty and not at all nice to use. My wife also  mentioned that the ladies weren't great either.
This is unacceptable, particularly during a pandemic when hygiene is paramount.
Always worth a visit though.",3
"The building itself is cool, but the service is poor (not enough bar staff) and the beer choice is pretty average.",3
"Very busy Sunday
This is a pub ....with food.
If you are looking for a restaurant to meet family on a Sunday. This isn't the place. If you want to meet your friends and have drinks and nibbles, this is the place for you.
Music way too loud if you want to sit outside, we asked to be moved. Also some random lady - who I presumed was part of the music 'act' -spinning around with a hula hoop. Very bizarre 🤣
Food was okay, nothing exciting, the steak sandwich was....erm...well we sent it back. Just a price of meat thrown in between two old slices.
Lots of food on the menu sold out or not available.
3 stars because the staff were lovely.",3
"Nice setting. We went for a meal, the food want bag, the service was better. It's ticked away of the main road and relatively quiet (we went on a Sunday evening) it's traditional pub fayre so you can't go wrong. Makes a nice change from the now ubiquitous offerings closer to nearby Borough Market.",3
"Booked a table, online, for lunch on July 24th for The George. Had a confirmation email straight away after booking and a reminder email a few days ago. Got there today, the day I booked my table for, at the time I booked for. They had no record of my booking. Luckily the place wasn’t busy and a table was found outside for us. The food was lovely. Only complaint was two separate homeless people going from table to table asking for money, while we were eating.",3
"I like the George.  The large courtyard is great in summer and the fire in the front room is cheerful in winter. They have a good beer selection and the staff are helpful. It gets very busy here, especially Friday evenings and Saturday afternoons and is popular with tourists. The food is fine without being great, and is filling,  if you are looking for good food there are lots of good options nearby.",3
"Not wheelchair friendly at all. There's a disabled toilet with the wheelchair icon on the door. The toilet is down some stairs, so it's NOT accessible to wheelchair users. Bit of a joke if you ask me.",3
"Always a great venue for history and beer. Today, two disappointing things. One, the staff seem to prefer chatting together rather than even looking at the customer they are serving.  Secondly, the Parliament Bar, my favourite, reeked of toilets today. Standards are slipping.",3
"had drinks here, covid safe, staff friendly  full of history , good to visit",3
"A return visit to this iconic venue after a disappointing sojourn last Oct. Management handled my previous complaints with what I can only describe as an exceptional aftercare service.
A special star to our server Theia who ensured that our every need was met.",3
"You would be surprised this pub has alot of history. If it's your first time in London, definitely an authentic pub feel. However can get a bit busy due to it's location. Drinks can take a while to be served.",3
"Really lovely pub, well worth a visit. However would only recommend for drinks, Greene King now runs it and the food is sadly pretty poor. 5/5 for drinks, 1/5 for food.",3
"We came here for a lunch on a Sunday. I'd tried to book on several occasions but they never picked up the phone, we decided to chance it anyway and were pleasantly surprised to find lots of tables free.

The drinks were mostly pretty good (one soft drink was a bit flat) and not excessively expensive given the area.

Service was also pretty good, with bar and waiting staff who were pretty quick.

All of this was let down by the food though, we had a philly cheese steak with no cheese, a sausage roll that was dry and a dessert that came with only half a spoon of ice cream. The food was cheap but you could tell.

In short:
Service = Good
Location = Amazing
Drinks = Good
Food = Bad",3
Bustling pub but only two small bars servicing more people than they can handle. 20+ minute wait for each and every round,3
"Nice old pub with huge outdoor yard filled with tables & benches but very crowded in the early evening. Had to queue 20 minutes for a drink on arrival and a couple of pushy people twice managed to force their way in when I stood back to let someone use the only visible card terminal on the bar. Chips were lovely though, crisp on the outside but soft & moist inside. Would go there again although it does attract a loud & pushy City clientele.",3
"Quaint, characterful pub but too few bar staff to cope with a very busy Saturday night. Queues were four deep at the bar at it took forever to get served. I would avoid on weekend nights.",3
"Lovely being able to sit outside on a very hot day.
Food average I had the Sunday roast which was nothing special and beef was a bit tough and tasteless.My partner, however, had the fish and chips which was excellent.
Tables outside not cleared very often and it all looked a little unclean and unwelcoming.",3
Great pub for a beer. Gets v busy and with a good atmosphere. The food is OK but nothing special.,3
"Lovely welcoming staff, great looking pub and great location.
Awful food. We paid £14 per head for a Sunday lunch, the food was cold and just really poor, 2 meals had to go back and the food still wasn’t hot!
I would revisit but for a drinks only",3
"Nice pub atmosphere, lots of space indoors and outdoors  but still a cozy historic pub. Good beer selection. Staff at the bar are reasonably good, wait staff are ok-ish. Food is poor. The menu promises way more than the food delivers(e.g. chips are oven chips, not triple cooked and they've never seen a fryer, fish goujons are supermarket fish fingers)",3
This large pub set back from Borough High St has a typical old London pub feel and it serves good drinks but for me it always too busy on a Thursday night. They do serve food but I have yet to try the restaurant. The seating area outside is also pleasant.,3
"Not very impressed. Location is ok, tucked in a yard off the main road. It was Christmas dinner so price I paid could be justified, but portions should have done that just as well. It was 3 course meal, soup was literally 5 spoonfuls, mains had 6 roast potatoes, 5 boiled Brussels sprouts, some carrot slices and a 2.5-3.00 square sized Wellington... Taste? OK, nothing Extra ordinary. I would rather avoid going there again, definitely not for Christmas dinner.",3
"Historic, spacious pub. Food is decent for the price and good range of beers on tap and in the fridge. You won't miss the  masive outdoor seating space which is  a huge plus but do look out for the balcony which is a nice touch.",3
"Sadly the food remains as mediocre as ever at this pub that has spent too many years reliant on uncritical tourist custom as it is in every guide book. They could not even reheat simple pasta dishes!
One plus point - they were offering free hot water bottles to ""group of six"" parties at outdoor tables in the courtyard.",3
"Went for work Xmas lunch, if it wasn't for that then my previous experiences there wouldn't have tempted me back as, like other reviewers, my previous experiences of the pub on summer evenings has seen it rammed to the gunwales.Definitely somewhere you go for the atmosphere rather than the food and drink!
Main course was much larger than expected with generous helping of meat and potatoes though the Yorkshire pudding was stone cold. Limited choice of desserts but this may have been because it was the fixed Xmas menu; either way, they were nothing special and screamed ""bought in from wholesaler"" rather than made on site.
Staff were pleasant and helpful and service was swift. The restaurant and bar were nice and quiet but I suspect this was due to it being the middle of a damp winter day.
Definitely worth a visit once in your life for the atmosphere, after that your mileage may vary.",3
"Fantastic atmosphere. Great yard and interiors. We went for dinner on a friday night. Beer was good. Food was average to poor. Lamb shank was perfectly good. Pork belly was not roasted to a crispy top, and was pretty awful. Roast beef was very mediocre too. However the apple crumble and sticky toffee pudding were both fantastic. Would definitely go back for a pint or two.",3
Tucked down a side street this place is a gem an old school pub that holds a lot of history. Reasonable prices for the area. The food was average but still very tasty with good menu choices. Good selection of craft beers and IPA.,3
"The place is fantastic for a drink, very cool building, defently worth going. But we had the Sunday roast one day, and I have to say it was the worst roast we have had so far in London, yorkshire pudding was like cardboard, the rest was meh",3
"This pub has a good outside space and a range of lagers, ales and wines.  However there tends to be only one bar open, even during peak summer time, so getting a drink is a chore.  It is not cheap - even by London standards - so more staff is not am unreasonable request.",3
"Fairly average pub but what makes it a delight is the huge courtyard seating area outside, which appears to be shared with a bar opposite. Handy if someone in your group prefers wine or cocktails.

Service was OK, staff seemed fairly disinterested and I had to interrupt a conversation between staff, complaining about a colleague being lazy(?), in order to ask that I be served.",3
"The is a truly history London pub, both Shakespeare and Dickens have drank here, unfortunately the inside has now be come a bit chain puby. With limited drink selection  and very average food.

however the court yard is a great place for a drink in the summer, best in the area",3
"Old pub with small bar areas barely keeping up with demand. However, the Greene King app can be put to use, to order from your table.",3
"Lovely pub but terrible food and service. Minuscule serving of poor quality sausages, microwaved until their ends are dry and chewy, with the meanest little disc of mashed potato I've ever seen, covered in overly strong, jelly like gravy.

I complained and got a hesitant agreement to bring some more potato which subsequently didn't arrive. The waitress refused to meet my eye the rest of the time we were there.

This was my birthday lunch out. Gutted. :(",3
"Lovely old pub in a good location. Had some mussels to eat, but unfortunately, nearly half were closed and inedible",3
"Nice pub, especially for the large outdoor area on a sunny day. However it is always understaffed and the food is possibly the worst in the area. Also the historical significance of the site is somewhat let down by the ugly office building that takes up two sides of the courtyard.",3
"Too big for its own good. Even though they have several bars you're going to have to wait a good, long while for a beer if you go after work. Our group ended up sticking with the person in the queue outside as our perch, and sending someone new into the queue each time the last had come back.",3
"No room inside....sat outside...bit chilly, however, good range of beers on tap. Good bar service.",3
Food is great but the service is poor,3
"I have been to The George Inn a few times, it is definitely a place to visit if you are sightseeing in London as you'll get to see an example of an old Inn which for visitors will be exciting. The courtyard and bbq is great and quite tucked away from most pubs in the area.

I have had a party here in the past and it wasn't great, not sure who's fault it was, but the food was booked and ordered but when it came out was missing a few dishes, portions and such. The Chef had pre cooked everything and were just left on the hot plate in the kitchen to be served up, so people ended up paying for half a plate. This was last year, so not sure if things have improved, just a warning if you are booking a party here.",3
"Always busy ... reasonable beer selection , but it's the outside  area you go for when it's warm. Toilets, well let's  just say they smell exactly as the name suggests, could really do with cleaning, pretty unpleasant.",3
"Disappointingly unremarkable given its centuries-long history. I suggest squeezing into the bar nearest to the High Street, as the rooms of the pub get gradually less characterful as you move further into the yard. Bunting hangs from the ceiling advertising Guinness and a plaque behind the bar tells me the bar staff are certified to pull a pint of Greene King IPA. This sets the tone. Few could get excited about the range of beers available. The yard is a fairly miserable place, although the blame falls squarely on the architect of the surrounding office complex.",3
Didn't have food.... wait was too long for everything.  Just had to leave...,3
"Visiting the George, a place of historical note in London Bridge, is not always a good experience it gets so overwhelmed with visitors and is  often not easy to enjoy any historical ambience. It is expensive and the quality and standard of service does not reflect the price you pay. It did not seem particularly clean or very well loved.",3
"Meh pub with OK beers even if architecturally interesting. It tends to be horrifically busy so finding a place to sit, or even stand is usually a struggle.  I haven't eaten here for a while but  the food was OK, last did I did - bog standard average pub fare but certainly nothing to write home about.",3
"A nice historical building, the food was nice and the staff were very nice, well worth a visit.",3
"Perfectly pleasant, busy touristy hub. Serving  pricy ubiquitous beers and wine and decent (also pricy) bog standard pre prepared pub grub.",3
Quite busy with a fairly boisterous clientele. Busy bar on a Saturday.,3
"Had a room upstairs small bar outside not open so had to order drinks on app very slow quicker to go down and get them
Place was very nice and in good location.",3
"Could be so much better. Nice location, historic pub in Central site. Overcrowded, overpriced, poor choice of ales and unhelpful, slightly surly young staff.

I don't rate it or recommend it but no doubt others will.",3
"Food was stone-cold (Club sandwich and fries) which was a shame. Otherwise it is a lovely pub: friendly staff, great beer and absolutely lovely in that rumpty-tumpty English pub way. I do like a Greene King, but pity about the food.",3
"Unique in its history. Nice outside courtyard if weather is clear, otherwise a bit poky for drinking inside. Drinks choice average. Few on cask, Estrella your continental lager & some terrible Greene King ""attempts"" at craft.",3
The bar is very small so there is often a long wait to get served... Longer than it takes to drink the beverage.,3
"Decent outdoor sitting and atmosphere. Killer queue times for a drink though (visited probably 5-10 times), probably worse more recently and at weekends.",3
Everyone's favourite meet up after work on Friday if it's cold as they have outdoor heater pubs and it clears out after 9 because everyone moves on kinda place. Good choice of beers too,3
"A fine pub to frequent after work. Food isn't bad but there isn't much going on with the beer choices.
Very large out side space!",3
"A tourist hot spot, this pub claims to be the oldest in London.
The courtyard provides a great spot to sit out and grab a drink. Definitely one to take out of town visitors to",3
"Service and atmosphere were fantastic, bar staff seemed very miserable, food was delicious however all aspects of the roast were cold and for the price portions weren't ideal. Toilet didn't have a toilet seat either, lovely location but not much else going on.",3
"Busy, broken toilet in the female's toilet and £11for 2 pints. The outside is beautiful but we've seen it now and unless we have visitors, I can't see us going back.",3
"We are so lucky to find this Inn. Its quite simple and beautiful. All views are nice. Its clean and relaxing. Staffs are awesome,they are easy to talk to. They know how they manage the visitors. Me and my family satisfied there services, its so great! :)",3
Leave it until the renovations are complete (ongoing April 2019). Interesting old pub. Food is standard pub fare - eat at Borough Market first. Still worth a visit.,3
"Good food in a rustic setting. Can get pretty packed on a sunny day, though. Lovely beer garden and some nice history here.",3
"Nice pub, with plenty of space, but a little pricey (it is Borough, after all).",3
"Love this place, but when trying to book a table for 7 people for dinner on a Saturday neither did I get the promised response within 24 hours on my enquiry (left email address and phone number ) nor did anyone pick up the phone when I tried calling. A shame as I would have loved to show this gem to my friends visiting. Now we shall have to go somewhere else. :(",3
This place is a stunning location. It's just not a great pub. And that's not a Covid thing. But glad they are still there.... Are you listening national trust?,3
"We were just looking for a lunchtime bite and had a half-decent ploughman's  (c. £14) in the courtyard. Quite a historic look and feel except for the modern building that's attached to it, courtesy of some university. Pidgeons were a nuisance but who can blame them.",3
"From the outside you see the History, popular little destination. Inside its okay nothing exciting, food was okay but think it trades on its History a bit too much.",3
National Trust owned building. Ok pub with great history as a coaching Inn. Marred by surrounding architecture. Gets very busy with posh city types and can get loud .,3
It is a remarkable building. Visiting here with the covid pointless mucking about made me think I was visiting a prison. Add to that crazy London beer prices - it makes visiting a definitive London pub just meh.,3
"Loverly old building, reasonable selection of ales. The butchers platter came with freshly made scotch eggs that were still warm and the eggs soft boiled.",3
Food was very average. Great old pub though but stick to the drinks,3
This is a cute place for anyone wanting to be in a super old Inn. The food was great & the beer is good too.,3
Nice venue but flat beer. We left after one pint,3
"Excellent setting but poorly delivered.

The food is very average.",3
"Great pub, a little small but the outside space allows people to enjoy a beer in comfort. Perhaps not so good in winter..",3
No Abbot ale and had to wait for ages only 1 serving at the time.,3
"Great watching the world cup on the outside screen, amazing history - Shakespeare's Local by Pete Brown is all about it. V busy for the football and the ale selection isn't great",3
"Confusing. We did not realize that food is ordered at the bar, then brought to the table.",3
Its fine. Comfortable and clean. Good draft beer selection and colourful bunch of locals but what happened to the food???,3
"It's a nice pub, busy, touristy, not much going for it apart from its history.  Staff are friendly enough but clientele a bit up themselves.",3
"Very nice interior, very old and traditional, but hugely expensive for a traditional pub. Also an area where pickpockets operate easily.",3
Indoors there are many different rooms and also there is outdoors space. Great history and beers but always too busy,3
"Over priced food, no more than adequately cooked and small portions , egg cup of sauce and salad is a load of lettuce !...",3
A bit shabby and toilets were filthy when it was busy on Saturday. Great quick service though given how busy they were.,3
Hole in the wall awesome bar but goes till 1 so can be annoying. Water pressure not so great but good breakfast and an awesome little town,3
There's a great selection of beers but they are all at a premium price.,3
Good place to watch football out doors but please raise the screen by 2 meters and you have an unbelievable place also no Sunday politics please England songs would go down a storm,3
"Great staff, not much social distancing. Good outdoor beer garden.",3
"Very nice outdoor area, and would be great in summer.

It felt like it would be a bit cramped in the pub itself, however given it was a weeknight, this wasn't an issue.",3
"Very busy with American tourists and only one person working the bar, felt very sorry for them!",3
Busy pub with plenty of outside seating. You have to go there at least once. No frills.,3
Somewhere different. Historical info all over. Food basic.,3
Pretty good fish and chips. Watch what you order or you'll end up with a side of fried smelt.,3
"Interesting historic tavern near Borough Market, good range of beers on tap if overpriced.",3
Nice place lovely setting. A little more expensive than some others. Food is good.,3
"Nice old pub with a big beergarden outdoors and a good variety of beers,which were a bit expensive though",3
Not bad pub with good choices of beer. Understaffed 10 mins to get served,3
Only one bar open on a Friday so queuing to get served was about 4 deep.,3
"Interesting venue, but getting increasingly tatty. Disinterested staff and a but grubby, but a solid pint and worth a visit just see the unusual building.",3
"Enjoyed the fish and chips,  however the music was extremely loud which was pretty unsettling to eat with.",3
Just a lovely warm glass of mulled wine to warm us up  but great setting.,3
"This is a real, old London pub. Good atmosphere, nice selection of alrs, and beers.",3
Great most times. Sometimes not so. Depends on the level of miserableness behind the bar. She knows she can be...,3
"Enjoy a great pint in historic setting, but for god's sake don't eat the food!",3
"Well organised with social distancing at lunch time. Staff helpful, food nice.",3
Lovely old pub but expensive for drinks even by London standards,3
"Nice place, watch out you don't get short changed though.",3
Lots of history but very crowded. Serves Greene King IPA.  Go somewhere else if you want to chill out and relax,3
ok but not great.  no sandwiches as toaster not working.  went on to a much nicer pub round the corner,3
Great pub even on beautiful but cold London day.,3
"Nice food, very slow to come from the kitchen. Best for drinks.",3
Good location in little yard off Borough High St. Friendly and good beers but pricey,3
Quaint historic pub - Really for the tourist - Best to visit at quiet times.,3
Overcrowded on a sunny day. Absolutely manic. Good nachos if you want food,3
"Seemed pretty touristy, but was still fine.",3
"Very atmospheric. Dear drinks, cheap grub",3
"Historic Inn maybe, and nice house ale, but the atmosphere was not really right.",3
"Average pub, beer ok, good outside seating",3
Long time to que and beer selection a bit average. The outdoor section is ok though....,3
Great atmosphere here and great staff. Food is mediocre.,3
We had a reservation to watch a game because they advertised but when we arrived there wasn't even a Tv,3
Nice but it’s £7 a pint,3
Plus points-- William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens used to drink here. Minus points-- they don't anymore.,3
"Had the pork tenderloin. Nothing special, came out at a reasonable time, hot and tasty.",3
Old historic building. Great fish and chips. Toilets appalling on the day,3
"A bit messy and never enough people manning the bar, but the patio with outdoor seating is spacious",3
"Cosy place if you can get inside, although no wheelchair access",3
Nice old pub but too touristy which can mean a long wait.,3
Great place for al fresco meal and drink,3
"Historical pub. Crowded at rush hour, stand outside for space. A tourist trap during the day time.",3
Quite loud and busy but it's a cool looking pub.,3
Great haunt for the old and young. Good staple British fayre and a great post (Guys) hospital pit stop!,3
Historical. But expensive. 5.60 a pint of lager and the next one was 6.00. why?,3
Very busy but otherwise very good,3
Bar busy. Drinks very expensive,3
Nice pub but way too crowded!,3
"Very busy, so service was poor and the food delivery was haphazard",3
Great old London pub. Prices decidedly 21st century.,3
nice atmosphere but food greasy.,3
Ancient ambiance and worth a visit.. Food ok only though...,3
Interesting interior but beers a bit predicable and short measures.,3
Very expensive lunch for what it is but nice to sit outside on a warm day,3
Nice place to drink as have a choice to also drink outside,3
Didn't have two of the drinks I wanted and no sandwiches or toasted sandwiches available. Disappointing,3
"staff dont answer the phone.

food was very quick to come out.",3
It's a pub. Serves beer. Nice courtyard.,3
"Large outdoor place, could be utilised much better on cold days.",3
£6.10 for a pint nice place not nice prices,3
Nice pub with a spacious outside area.,3
"Could be, should be so much better.  Lovely architecture and history.",3
It's a pub. With tables and seats. Near borough market.,3
"Worth a visit for historical reasons, national trust owned.",3
It's just ok. Could be more. Much better around the corner. Survives on its history.,3
Pints were flat but good atmosphere,3
Nice ales on tap. Fine for a beer after work,3
Typical and cosy pub in an alley off Borough High Street,3
Good beer,3
Too busy. Left without a drink. Early Friday afternoon.,3
A bit disappointed with the quality of the food but venue was good,3
Good array of clothing for the little ones,3
Lovely location . Food ok . A bit overpriced.,3
The lunch was gòod but the ladies toilets were filthy,3
Good. Crowded. Nice people. Pretty building.,3
Only galleried Inn left in London so worth a visit!,3
"Great history, but after that it's not a great spot",3
Service was good. The food just ok.,3
"Nice staff and atmosphere, bit pricey",3
"Full of balding Geezers, with tattoos of their dogs on their legs.",3
"A tourists pub, usually with a long wait to be served.",3
"Historical gem, tainted by association with vulture capitalists Greene King.",3
Nice. Crowded in a good way. Not comfy,3
Quaint but too small and loos a bit run down,3
Expensive beer. But historically interesting.,3
Nice pub good food,3
Great pub food disappointing,3

"This is a beautiful historical pub with a nice spacious courtyard that is ideal for sunny days. The atmosphere was good. The service from bartenders was fairly efficient but unfriendly and impolite. I was quite taken aback by the tone of the bartender. If there was good reason for it, I'd understand it a bit more, but there wasn't. I just feel that the atmosphere should be relaxed and comfortable, but it just makes it unpleasant. This seems to happen often in London in general, however.",3
"Nice but dirty place. Every table was sticky and full of glasses who haven't been picked up, there was also a lot of trash on the floor. But they had really nice music and pretty decorations!! You only have service if you buy food, drinks are self-service.
Overall okayish pub, but more touristic kind of place. Will sadly not be visiting again.",3
"On a tourist street and the bar was really crowded. You seat yourself and order at the bar make sure you know your table number when you go to the bar. The fish was good but the fries were not that great. A decent experience.
I would not return",3
"The most mediocre Sunday roast have ever tried. Left half of beef as it wasn’t particularly edible. High prices, too",3
"Staff were nice.
Waiting time was fine.
Roast dinners were inconsistent.
Stuffing was rock solid like concrete! Chicken was dry but edible.",3
Think this pub has recently been refurbished. Lovely inside and good atmosphere. Bit pricey for a pint though,3
"Interestingly laid out pub with an even more interesting history. Apparently the place still has an unrevoked licence granted by Charles 1st no less, to be a brothel.
I was there for a more conventional pint of beer - the pub being on the Cask Marque Ale Trail.
As I was one of the first customers in, non of the ales on offer had been drawn off and the staff (all foreigners) had no idea what was required.
Settled for a bottled beer and rated the pub accordingly.",3
"No tea as machine to heat the water is broken, as always.  A kettle would solve this problem. I didn't have any alternative as I only have tea. I wouldn't have stayed if I hadn't been with a large group. Very noisy and difficult to hear any conversation without others having to move very close.",3
"Might be the crowd, but tables only getting cleaned half, food being tasteluster. Overall experience not up to par with previous encounters.",3
"I went there with my wife, the food is good, and the place is nice and has a good atmosphere but the guy who took our order (Miles according to our ticket) had a lousy attitude, was very rude and umpleasant, nothing like his coworker (Claudia) who was very charming and helpful.

We highly recommend the chicken tikka and the chocolate fudge cake.

Would be back someday buy you have to pick your staff better, that simple thing made us regret entering there for a while.",3
"Nice selection of beer. The food was alright but not outstanding.

Unfortunately it gets incredibly cold everytime someone comes through the door in winter. Maybe put up a curtain to prevent the wind from blowing in everytime the door opens.

You have to order your food at the bar, if you sit in the upper area. The steak and ale pie tasted good, the potato mash on the side was nice as well but the seasonal vegetables were overcooked and tasted super boring. I asked for more gravy but they never brought it.",3
"Lovely place right  close to Trafalgar square. For the price i would say tye meal size is a bit on the small size, but good quality nonetheless.

Good range of craft beers on tap.",3
"Good location next to Trafalgar Square Greene king chain, so ordered from the app. Food was good had meat pie. The only downside was there was no children's menu and we where with our grandchildren.",3
Disappointing. Greene King need to be trying harder. This is in the plum spot in London and it felt like everything is taken for granted.    Only 2 staff on the bar taking all food and drink orders meant large queues and a long wait. My food was OK but my wife's roast dinner was poor. To be fair the prices were reasonable and table service was good but all of the cask ales were off and the toilets smelled bad and felt grotty.,3
"Service behind the bar was rude. You have to find a table, then send a representative to the bar to order and give them the table number. The line for the bar is long, unorganized and it's very loud. The bartender entered my table number wrong, the tap ran out of the cider I ordered, so he sent me to my table with the promise to bring it to me when he replaced the keg..... 35 m later, no drink, no food, no waitress to help. Finally found a waitress about 45 minutes in and she found my food order, had to go get my drink herself and she acted irritated the entire time.

I hope they just had a very bad day and it's not like that all the time. But, I don't think I will try again.",3
"Food was just ok, the apple pie drink was the best",3
"We went in on Saturday night, managed to get a table. We ordered food and drinks online. The drinks took a very long time to come so I had to go to the bar and ask where they were. This issue was soon sorted out. The food arrived not long after. I had pie and mash, it was very tasty.

The only negative I have really is the young girl with glasses clearing the tables was quite off with us when we spoke to her. She clearly didn't want to be at work and had no customer service skills at all.

We would go back next time we are in London.",3
"The location is great, however the food could see some improvement. We’ve ordered the traditional fish&chips dish which was very oily. I get that they are busy as we are approaching the new year’s but it’s still my money and it wasn’t cheap.",3
"Food was amazing
But the staff was rude to foreigners...",3
"Stopped in on a whim, food was mediocre at best. Guinness pint was fresh, if you're stopping in for a drink that's about all I would suggest. I had the fish and chips. I've had much better.",3
Just don’t order steak sandwiches,3
"Good location just off Trafalgar Square. Today draft beers are all off, reason unknown so 2 small bottled beers are £10.60. A bit too pricey so no rush to return here.",3
"Wifes meal was wrong the first time, then the correct meal had the wrong toppings and sides. My meal had the wrong sides. No wonder they male you pay for the food first.

Stupid ordering system. Was unfamiliar with a system like it so be sure to bring your wallet to the bar when you order your food.

Food was good not amazing. Atmosphere and seating was nice.",3
"Five of us went in for tea on a Saturday, wasn't too busy, ordered our food all together but two meals arrived, then five minutes later another two, and when those meals were almost finished, the fifth meal turned up. If a number if meals are for the same table it's best they all arrive together.  Besides that, atmosphere was good and food really nice.",3
"Nice pub, very central. Went on London Marathon day, so that should be taken into account. Drinks service was horrendous using the QR code. 40 minutes for a pint of Guinness. Bar service should be resumed.",3
Very large pub (big downstairs area) with Sky Sports on big screens. Surprisingly unbusy considering the time that we visited (afternoon on a Sunday). Pretty much standard Green King but it was good as we got plenty of space. The only thing is that the staff weren't very welcoming but I imagine that that is to do with the location and constant barrage of tourists.,3
"For a Saturday night at 2130 it was very quiet, a little too quiet. So we only stayed for a couple of drinks and left.",3
"Had a few drinks here with colleagues to mark my retirement. Chosen because usually reasonably quiet, which isn't usual for many pubs in this area. Was OK but service was really slow. Need more bar staff, even if quiet!!",3
"Nice pub not too far from Trafalgar Square with normal Greene King prices, which was welcome in the capital.",3
"We dropped in here for a quick drink and a rest from the heat. We went straight to the toilets as the tables were all quite full, it was very busy. Toilets were disgusting and locks broken etc. We went back upstairs as the downstairs area was closed. Managed to find a table and get a drink. Didn't eat here so can't comment, food looked ok.",3
"Meal was cold and pumps were not working so we couldn't get a decent drink, however the atmosphere was great and it is a nice place to eat and drink if everything was working",3
"Bizarrely, big sections of the pub were closed off with reserved signs, even though the reservations weren't for another five hours, so was difficult to get a table. Eventually ate. Food was pretty standard, but no complaints. Service was good.",3
"Good pub. The food is not great, and the service was not great either. A good place for a pint though.",3
"Food lovely, service reasonable, toilets absolutely disgusting, how they think it's OK to open like that is beyond me.wont go again. One toilet full to the brim one half ripped off",3
"Kind of a tourist pub right off Trafalgar square. It was pretty empty for early Sunday night but there was a rowdy group in the downstairs room. There was a major demonstration in front of the Brazilian embassy earlier in the day and it carried over to the pub albeit not as loud. Meanwhile,  there was no table service and no one behind the bar happened to mention it when we sat down. After some time I figured it out and went to the bar to get drinks. After a more than ten minute wait while the bar keep attempted to keep the peace between two groups from the demonstration, I finally got my drinks. Gave it three stars only because the beer selection was good.",3
"The food  was average, the place is nice. The camembert was really good but please explain me why serving it with carrots and cucumber ? I'm french I almost felt insulted x)",3
"Food was not great, toastie was almost burnt and IPA was flat. Service from bartender and wait staff was good though.",3
"OK, just your standard chain. Had a decent number of taps but was very very busy.",3
"Not too busy, quiet with typical gastropub menu. Good service even though they were short staffed.",3
"Good location, dodgy pints of Guinness",3
"""Vile food"" is carved into the woodwork near the toilets.  We didn't try the food.  It's another Greene King pub.  Seemed to be run by three young Eastern Europeans.  Smelled funny and not very clean.  Not a standout.",3
Decent traditional pub but they need to clean the tables and the toilets more frequently,3
Not bad!!! Just not for me!!,3
"The service at the bar is very slow you need more people behind the bar.
Also the waiting staff speaking the queen's English would be a massive help",3
Place was empty unfortunately as its a big pub. Used to use it in 1979 when based in Whitehall with RN. Dont remember it being this big. Good drinks selection no food though.,3
"Lovely London pub. Reasonable choice of food, just a shame they stop serving meals around 8pm and don't mention it.",3
An ok center of London pub for a quick wine and snack. Well located and staff friendly. Table a bit sticky though did enjoy the food.,3
"A decent pub in Central London. Traditional atmosphere, good quality food. May be a bit pricy for the service they offer, but it's worth a visit if you are a fan of ""no frills"" service.",3
"Good beer and staff, however was soured with my friend's chair breaking underneath him. All they did was fill accident report book and give him a replacement chair",3
"Not bad at all, typical London pub with decent pub grub and a variety ales and spirits. Good for a few beers and a chat with friends.",3
"The food is really good. However, I find the service quite unfriendly. Also the price is quite high, but it's expected since it's near trafalgar Square.",3
"Expensive!! £7 for a single gin and lemonade, but nice atmosphere and good food ☺️",3
"Nice atmosphere, decent but unexciting food, and little to no service... So good for drinks, but choose the neighbouring pub for food and better service instead.",3
Food was ok. Came very quickly. Very busy as you expect for a London pub. Easy for tourists but not much character.,3
"Not for me, food was too greasy. Service was a bit slow.",3
"It's OK for able bodied visitors, Wheelchair users beware, the lift was extremely slow!, at least 5 mins to get two feet up!, after using it a fellow wheelchair user in a motorised, could not get it to lift, the staff couldn't help,and the user had to stay in the entrance!,  the place is nice, but expensive for London",3
Had some problems with shortages of drinks when we visited but a nice place right on the edge of trafalgar Square,3
Great pub but toilets let it down,3
"No ales, 13 quid for a pint and half plus soft drink. No kids menu. Not very good.",3
"A bit messy on the tables and around. Nice waitress at the bar, who gave me beer to tadte before ordering it. Food was ok.",3
Absolutely mediocre Whitehall pub that does the job. Would have scored higher if they didn't charge me for the cordial in my lager and lime.,3
Nice pub in the city centre. Not far from the Big Ben and Trafalgar's square. Quite crowded. Food on average.,3
At the top of Whitehall near Trafalgar Square.  Typical chain pub and service was slow. Waited over 30 minutes for just toasted cheese sandwiches at lunch,3
Friendly pub in the centre of London. Good range of beer.  Didn't try food but looked good and reasonable.,3
"Food not so great , mood awsome  😃",3
Convenient location. Good atmosphere and beer selection. Opt for something other than the burger.,3
"Here is easy to go place for single person and a group of persons.
There are many choices for draft beers. There are a variety of foods.",3
"Standard pub with standard drinks, good service. Can be very busy due to the location by whitehall and trafalgar square.",3
A nice pub with good atmosphere. The fish and chips were great (and big)!,3
"Nice pub, Friendly Staff , it's ok",3
It's fine as a meeting place but no real atmosphere and loads of tourists,3
For a Saturday was really busy more staff needed as was waiting to long to get served,3
Nice traditional boozer. London prices though!,3
Service a bit slow compared to previous visits,3
"Decent meat pie, but the pastry was hard/stale, the vegetables were pretty bland.",3
"Pretty standard Greene king pub. Cavernous interior, easy to find seats.",3
"Beer is ok, the stuff not so pleasant.",3
"Pretty pricey, go across the road and get the same food for a fraction of the price.",3

"Pub looks tired but lives on unchanged in tribute to past patrons with old photos etc on the wall and old pub feature lights, of long since stopped beers, above the bar.  No idea what the trough is at the bottom of the bar - as you can see in the photo.  Any ideas?",3
"Nice pub with a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Pretty quiet compared to the surrounding area which is good for a chilled out vegetarian or vegan lunch. I like the fact it is vegetarian, and also serves vegan beers and ciders, however unfortunately the food wasn't much to write home about. The tofish and chips was pretty average, and it was also relatively expensive at £11.95. In retrospect I wouldn't pay more than around £8 for what it was. I'd say worth going for the drinks, not the food.",3
"Nice, straight but gay friendly and sometimes better than gay bars. Dated decor (as if it matters much!) All that is needed is good beer and a smile!
Hadn't had food there so.cant say about it.
A German beer conoser of mine highly recommends their selection of beers.",3
"Efficient bar staff, decent central London prices £5.50-£6.00 per pint.

EDIT: Visited again but this time my mates bag containing his laptop got stolen (Fri 24/11/23). A member of the bar staff said they were going to review the CCTV footage when they had some free time and call my mate back but never did. Hence the drop to 3*, still a decent pub though but remember to stay vigilant at all times!",3
"We had the vegan fish & chips and tasted fairly well, even though the fish was simply a large block of tofu with some algae. It could have been more elaborate. They were only able to accept cash.",3
Nice place with a good atmosphere and good beer. Average pint price for London of around £6.50/7,3
"Soho pub, drinks and crowds as expected.

The place gets super busy and the staff remind you to remember what you want to order before you get to them, one might expect better service - but hey you’re in soho central.

The selection of beers and alcohol is nice and all kept in decent condition.

Gonna give it a 3 ⭐️ just because I don’t appreciate being told to keep my drink order in mind before I get to the staff.",3
"Would've given 5 stars as the interior is lovely and the atmosphere is great, but the woman serving us that night was extremely snappy and rude. She accused my friend of staring at her (he was literally looking down his glass as he drank).",3
Lovely boozer. I love the carpet❤️ Prices are extremely high.,3
"Nice old fashioned pub with a piano and some good beers on tap.
Part of the Fullers group which occasionally runs free pint promos but they seem to have an issue with these/don't accept them, for example the latest Amstel promo. However, other Fullers pubs in the area don't seem to have a problem.",3
Still largely unchanged since the days Jeffrey Bernard propped up the bar,3
"Quirky, small & English heritage tea shop located above the pub. You have to walk through the counter area to get there though lol 😁.  Good selection of teas with great historical stories. Tables a review a bit wonky & staff although kind got our order incorrect, so just make sure the staff are aware. Quite nice vibe and they serve mini cakes as well on the Sunday, although some guests are a bit intrusive withheld conversations, a gentleman seated to the rear side of me seemingly was having a conversation that occasionally spilled over in the direction of my guest, I do not know what that was about. Generally, a mature clientele, families, friends & couples. Worth a short visit.",3
"A shadow of its former self. Fuller's have tried to respect history and not renovate the place. I think that's admirable and understandable and they also have lovely staff. However, the fact remains it is still a very shabby place that needs a new floor and better toilets as a minimum.",3
Weirdly dingy and not in a charming way so moved upstairs to the very sweet tea room to eat. Ordered to tofish and chips and it wasn't as great as expected; the batter and seaweed was nice but the tofu itself was bland. An item was missed off our order and only one member of staff smiled at us once. Might be tempted to go back for afternoon tea but not again for the main menu.,3
I came to the pub today and I had pie and mash and while I enjoyed the food I couldn't get over how small the mash potion was and that was the only vegetable with the pie.  I just think at that price the pub could spare to add some peas and a few carrots or a bit extra.  I shouldn't leave a pub feeling still hungry after  just having a meal.,3
"I had the tofush and chips which was very nice; the 'fish' is wrapped in seaweed and then battered so it tastes very 'real'. It came with homemade vegan tartar sauce which again tasted very authentic and was delicious.

We ordered the superfood salad to share, but were disappointed as it was mostly baby spinach leaves instead of actual substance (a few pieces each of broccoli, tofu and avocado, which we had hoped would be the bulk of the meal); if either of us had ordered it as our main meal we would have been very disappointed, especially for almost £12.

We also ordered the five bean burger but were brought the mushroom burger; the waitress didn't write anything down when I gave the order which is fine if it works but it evidently didn't. It was lucky that my friend isn't vegan because the mushroom burger comes topped with cheese.

The service was bad - we were there early and it wasn't busy but they didn't seem to care whether we enjoyed the food or not. It sort of felt as though they were trying to go for an edgy Shoreditch pub vibe where they almost ignore the customers, but for an old vegetarian pub in Soho it just didn't suit them and it came across as bad service. The food was very nice - proper pub chips, great fish - but again, £12 for fish and chips is expensive. I wouldn't go back.",3
"This claims to be the only vegetarian and vegan pub in London, though we didn't eat here so can't comment. A round cost £14 (for a pint, spiced rum and coke and a pint of lemoade with orange juice). The (female) toilets had some interesting graffiti on the walls (lots of feminist comments and slogans). They have sing alongs on Wednesday and Saturday evenings.",3
"If you are looking for glamour. Forget it. If you've lost your soul maybe you'll find it here. A proper boozer with a piano.  Perfect for those lonely nights when you need to reflect on life around strangers, or maybe you make a friend.",3
Cold. No heating. Even men had their overcoats on.,3
"In the pub (not in the secret tearoom), we Could Feel exactly like david and jack at the slaughtered lamb.
John Landis could film American Werewolf in London here.
Deep silence and cold.  We can hear ourselves chew.

Decent faux fish and chips. Brilliant tartar sauce.

Please, a bit if music.",3
"Not bad, older style pub, better than these new style bars! Decent collection of beer, spirits and snacks on offer!",3
Best night is Monday when a fantastic choir pop in after rehearsals and have an impromptu sing a long around the piano- sometimes the other punters join in. The toilets need attending to and sometimes the tonic in tap doesn't taste right.,3
"Vegan pub. :) Loving it and went back 2x in one month for the upstairs.
Update: Went for a drink and was overcharged by bar staff. Also, bad service and not great beer selection. Won't go back.",3
"A great Soho landmark. It looks like the developers have moved in, let's hope they don't ruin it. I think they will. ☹️
They haven't, the character has been kept, still the same old pub.😀",3
"Tofish and chips is a great idea for a dish, but the tofu block they use was very big compared to the breading which made the taste a bit bland. Cat is very cute though.",3
"Pub OK, beer is dear bit it's london. Toilets need attention to them they are bad",3
Not a big fan of their signature dish. It was mostly a tofu block wrapped in seitan. Their portion size was good.,3
Traditional looking English pub but all food is vegan.. probably should have researched this before stopping in for a pint and some bar snacks!,3
"Nice tofish and chips (vegan fish and chips) but not the best - not that fishy. Still, I hope they don't close the place down, as seems to be on the cards.",3
"Vegan pub, the owner was a bit rude to my friend and the beer was expensive even for Soho (I ordered a pint of leffe and it was £7.20) but cosy atmosphere and was very fun for watching the England game",3
"Handy little drinking spot, with sing along piano playing in the evening, a bit dingy though and in need of a refurb. Secret tea room on the top floor.",3
"it's a pub, it used to be great, but then so did Soho...now, like the entire are its a pale imitation of it's former self",3
"This place is a walk back in time with a definite retro feel. However, the state of the chairs were beyond acceptable and need replacing.",3
I know it's famous and all that but the place is just too packed. We'll it has been the last couple of times I've been. A victim of its m success,3
It's a rather nice pub with a lot of atmosphere. It would rate higher than this but it's often so packed it's nearly impossible to get in and move around.,3
"Beware, not serving food anymore. Could someone remove the “now serving vegetarian comfort food” text in the details on Google?",3
Most disgusting filthiest toilet I've ever seen in a bar or a restaurant in my life you really need to sort it out other than that perfect,3
"good traditional pub , great for people watching,  quite pricy though",3
"Handy for a quick drink before the theatre, or to avoid the crowds. Nice staff.",3
"Good Soho pub, but not as good as it once was. Definitely less ""characters"" than there once was.",3
"Standard pub and very busy, but at least you can get real ales somewhere in the area, even if it is a very small selection.",3
"It's a rather traditionally sticky and somewhat smelly pub, nothing special",3
"Disappointing really, after all the years of reading Private Eye. It's just an OK pub with a famous name.",3
"OK pub, but gets crowded very easily. Staff friendly",3
Pretty unremarkable but pleasant enough soho pub.,3
Good for a  get out  but beer prices took much,3
"Nice pub but small, short kind of licuours",3
"All the pics of famous stars, and some that I didn't know have all gone. .",3
"I just learned that it's a vegetarian pub, and my kids were not happy!",3
Nice but Always packed. It makes it challenging to get food,3

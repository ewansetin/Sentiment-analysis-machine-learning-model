"Bad experience, I lost an expensive belt while going through the control.
When I was passing the control, the border agent told me and the people behind me to leave all small liquids,laptops inside the bags (I thought there was some improvement to the scanning machine). Anyways, we did this, and the 10 of us that did this got our luggage flagged so they had to be rescanned (On top of that there was a queue building up as it was early in the morning). There was a young guy (airport staff) helping in the scanning section (dark skin, 18-23 years old, looking like a chav) wno was carrying the trays and putting them through the scanner again. When he saw my tray, I saw him taking an interest and touching some stuff around in the distance, I couldn't really see as he passed by a column and was covered. When my stuff came out, I was in a hurry as my flight was boarding, and got all my stuff from the tray and did not notice that my expensive belt (Paul Shark Brand, over 300 euros) was gone. I only realised when I made it to the plane. I believe the chav dude took my belt out and kept it for himself. Disgusted. The airport's help is appalling, I immediately sent an email and asked them to check lost property if my belt was there but nothing. I told them the exact time and hour I went through the control and asked them to check CCTV cameras as I believed one of his employees stole my belt but they totally ignored my email. Unhappy and dissatisfied and will file a complaint report.",1
"Possibly the worst airport in the UK and I have flown from Manchester and Luton.
We waited for nearly half an hour after landing for the one and only transfer bus. Once in the building the service handler failed to open the door to allow people through into the terminal itself. There were a great many people and an escalator bringing us all up to the unopened door, therefore causing a crush at the top with people unable to protect themselves from falling. It was chaos.

This airport is literally in the middle of nowhere. Airport taxis charge £33 for a taxi to Leeds Railway station! The alternative is 50 mins by bus . There is nothing to recommend it. Truly appalling. Fly from anywhere other than this place is my very strong advice.",1
"I want to use LBA & be proud of it welcoming visitors to our beautiful county but this airport is an embarrassment.
We arrived back from Alicante & on leaving the transfer bus were left outside the arrivals area without shelter in a hailstorm. Once inside the arrivals we got on the escalator, as we reached the top the area was packed with passengers & bags so we couldn't get off.
There were people behind us with nowhere to go & many were elderly. It was a scary situation not helped by staff members shouting hit the button but no one knowing where this button was. It was a miracle nobody was injured.
The queue to get through immigration was a long one taking nearly  40 minutes. There are no toilet facilities until after passport control & these are small & inadequate.
I think management at LBA should take a look at Alicante airport & use that as a template. It is well organised, spacious, has quality facilities & the staff are professional & motivated. Prerequisites for an airport these days but which sadly seem to be lacking at Leeds Bradford.
The whole experience at LBA was challenging & not enjoyable. This was mid April so I dread to think what it will be like in July & August. I for one will not be going to find out, sadly I'll go via Manchester until Doncaster is operational once again.",1
"Exciting Journeys Do Not Start Here.

Appalling management of security. Over 50 minutes wait with inaccurate wait times displayed, stating 25 mins. Be warned!! The whole thing is arranged around selling fast track. Which isn't faster!! The idea of your lovely holiday starting with a soul destroying queue is a fine example of the contempt which we are held in. I would loved to have spent some money airside on food and drink but only 1 of 4 lanes was open so didn't have time. I have been to many airports and this is by far one of the worst security processes I've and my traveling compansions have experienced. Just awful. No staff about and unesscary slow processes, broken machinery on one lane but staff didn't have the mental capacity to open another lane instead just stood about. They shouted at people without cause, rude and poorly organised. Worryingly the conditions in the security area presented a significant risk as staff were not being diliengent enough nor able to manage the public effectively. The only toliet was out if order. The gates area was messy and dirty the staff were rude and the many stores with tills closed... 'because they are'. Very poor service. The whole security breakdown occurred at a crucial time due to poor maintenance of equipment and poor planning. The whole things is a sign of poor management and leadership.

If you want to start your holiday in a hot, uncomfortabke queue, be late for your flight, be shouted out, be stressed then book at LBA. If not, then book at Manchester Airport which you manage to get through in under 15 mins.",1
"Shambles of a place. They no
idea how to run an airport. Waited on plane 1/2 hr just to get to arrivals when we could have walked in 2 minutes. Then another 1/2hr que for passport control. You lot are so behind everyone else. Get a grip",1
"They create a problem by delaying security checks, wich crates a que all the way to the entrance door.
And after they try to sell you a fast track ticket on their website for £9. Cheeky management. Will try to avoid the airport when possible.",1
Absolute carnage. Two people on security. The queues were enormous. One staff member checking boarding passes for an entire flight. Left standing in what looks like a portacabin. It’s a disgrace. Airport management should be ashamed. Airline should be ashamed. Employ more staff and stop lining the wallets of the already wealthy executives.,1
"Absolute joke of a airport.
May call itself international but it isn't.
Dirty floors and lack of comfortable seating.
Going through security was an experience not to be repeated.
Absolute chaos . I wouldn't be surprised if people passed through with items not permitted.
No one appeared to be in charge and staff were all over the place like headless chickens.
On arrival back at LBA we were bussed to the terminal where surprise surprise the escalator up towards passport control was not working.
I cannot remember a time when it was operational and neither could some fellow passengers. Why?
I use this airport purely for convenience.
This does not mean however that it is acceptable for it to be so disorganized and dirty every time I travel.
Someone needs to be held to account for this sorry state of affairs and pull their finger out.",1
"Arrived today at Leeds Bradford Airport.  This has to be one of the most depressing airports in the UK, and the UK has the worst airports of any developed country I have visited in the past 20 years.

20 minutes for a bus to take passengers from the plane, a car park that is a building site, a worn out terminal, £6 car park charge to collect a passenger.  A poor bus service - every 1 hour 20 minutes to Harrogate, the nearest town.  No realistic train connection.  No near motorway even though Leeds has motorways running north, south, east and west.  I cannot think of anything positive to say.",1
"Absolutely the worst experience about this airport. It’s a pity that Doncaster-Sheffield (which was waaaay better than LBA) has been shut down and WizzAir moved their network to Leeds. No speaker and announcements about gates, delays etc. Absolutely no sound at all at this „airport”. Counters covered behind metal doors. Very rude employees. I missed flight because absolutely nobody informed about gate number (flight was delayed and gate was secretly displayed on screen AFTER scheduled departure time). It’s ridiculous how bad they’re treating people there. And one security lane is also a joke. If someone has a choice to fly from different airport, I would recommend to do this, even if it’s a bit further. One word can describe this place: disaster.",1
"disgusting, I used just 2 minutes or less the pick up of that small car park but i paid £6 for it. they designed the pick up point inside one of their small car park so visitors must pass the barrier into the car park to the pick up point and of course in exit point there are barrier to charge them. the person on the phone told me that it is what it is!!! well robbery everywhere by every one who say or manage these robberies.
when you go to other countries, all the shopping centres or airports are free but ""best country in the word"" is charging even more than they can in anyway and they can be rude to you too. just because they can.",1
"I must be one of many people who are ashamed of our local airport. The toilets are disgusting and smell awful. In the ladies toilet in the baggage reclaim hall the bins were overflowing with used sanitary products. The walkway out to the planes looks like it’s never been cleaned - thick with cobwebs and very dirty. It is freezing cold in the winter and the departure gates at the far end, where you are made to wait outside before boarding, is a joke with the toilets seemingly out of order on a permanent basis. Even the Yorkshire longe was one of the worst lounges I have ever been in. Stained seating, dirty tables and with no dedicated toilets. You desperately need to improve. I feel I need to apologise to friends and relatives who visit us via this facility.",1
"Absolutely dreadful airport, this is an organisation that has no means of contact so they think they are above the law. They have no interest in speaking to the public about their services and allow parking thugs to operate all car parks. When I travelled abroad I managed to take 2 pairs of scissors and a cheese knife in my hand luggage unchallenged, nobody at security asked me to remove my shoes either, it was a shambles. A disaster waiting to happen.",1
"one way parking system, no
advanced indication that you can not turn away or around once you entered one way system, without incurring hefty fees or fines. I was taught a lesson.
and so will every unsuspecting customer or visitor.well done.
recommend getting a taxi or bus.or get a train to Manchester and avoid LBA.",1
"Awful made to stand on a bus in cramped conditions which with the current medical condition I have caused severe pain. This could have been resolved by just letting me off the bus to walk or sit for a short while. Whilst it is appreciated that the problem was not of the making of the staff present it was purely down to poor planning and a poorly provisioned so called International Airport.

First and hopefully last time there.",1
"Was told by LBA staff that our flight was full, so we couldn't have hand luggage. Had to unload half of our stuff into a bag provided them and check in our now half empty handbaggage. All in the name of saving space. Got on the half booked plane to see we were only one of a few that had to do this. Tons of room in overhead lockers. 4 hours in Amsterdam with no toiletries or power cables for laptop etc. Why did they lie to us?",1
"An airport to avoid. Dramatically bad logistics and infrastructure, dirty, understaffed, make zero effort to treat passengers in a humane way. In case of issues passengers are kept on their toes with updates saying ""the next update will happen in 30 minutes"" (sometimes 60). This repeats for many hours with no real info. One representative told me that she can't tell when the bus transfer to another airport will arrive - ""this can be 30 minutes or 4 hours"" so we wait forever at a door instead of just relaxing for hours getting a full meal at a restaurant. And once they give updates they are probably made by random update generator because they are completely unrealistic and I mean physically impossible which is apparent at first glance. Evil people.",1
"The worst airport ever!!
I've been just dropping off my wife today and guess what - I had to pay 6 pounds fee for dropping off option, which should be free. It took me 2 minutes to enter the gates, let my wife go and get to the exit gate. It's a robbery.
Moreover after speaking with my wife she said it's a very stresful flight, as they're massive ques everywhere and she was so scared that she would not be able to do everything on time. We arrived few minutes after 4 o'clock and the flight is 7:10pm, so u could imagine how time consuming and bad organised this airport is.

Shame. Will defnietly avoid in the future.",1
Dropping my elderly mother off and got charged £6 for 4 minutes of parking at the drop off area. My mother is a proud woman who does not want a disability badge but the free parking is a significant walk away especially on a winters evening. I don't mind paying but £6 is taking advantage of the situation.,1
"Car rental is a long way to walk in the dark with limited lighting and no signposts. Security area too small and crowded. The walk through the shops is bad if you have claustrophobia due to low ceiling, narrow walkways, over ambundance of shops with glaring lights, music, perfume. No decent seating areas that are quiet. All the food places were appaling (price, food option/quality, service, atmosphere). Makes no attempt to make flying less stressful. The airport needs a major revamp, modernisation to bring it into the 21 century rather than cheap build add ons cramming more into small space. Only good point being a smaller airport less likely to suffer delays.",1
"Flew from LBA on 14th February 2024.
Major problems at security at around 7am due to faulty equipment and extremely poor staff.
Communication between security staff and passengers was non existent.
Took 55 minutes to process 2 items of hand luggage.
Appalling service.",1
"“If only I could give this place no stars. What a dump. It’s been a few years since we flew from here but I doubt they have cleaned the toilets in that time, they are truly vile. In fact the whole experience was horrible, heaven knows how much cash this place generates, but you can be sure none of it is being reinvested, it’s dirty.
Whoever is in charge needs to go and have a look at Newcastle or Teesside airports, that’s how to do it, genuinely whoever is in charge should be ashamed of themselves.",1
"Awful, nothing about it is good, sucks so bad. Like a windy wet fart. Has to be worst airport in Europe for a number of reasons, it just isn't built for purpose at all.",1
"Disgusting signage regarding all parking options available. An attempt to ensure fines will be handed out to confused travellers for extra revenue? It's absolutely despicable. Poor narrow access roads makes parking more difficult too. On leaving, one way systems operate at points where they are not necessary or practical. BEWARE, stop on a red line and there's a fine coming your way! LBIA need to totally review their traffic and parking management syste!",1
"The worst experience I have ever had at an airport - ever! Please read this and take note. This airport is an absolute ripoff. I dropped my wife off this morning, flying to the USA via Dublin - only the road forks immediately outside the terminal. Which way do you go, you may be asking yourself? Well……..0-10 minutes immediately outside the airport is going to cost you SIX POUNDS! Are you kidding me? Like so many others have posted, I inadvertently ended up in a bus only lane………so reversed up to select a different lane and drop my wife off at departures. There are cameras everywhere to catch your Registration Plate……so you are paying ££££ whichever way you go. Distasteful signs warn of ‘stopping’ anywhere on the roadway, for fear of a massive fine in the mail. This airport is WORSE than Heathrow. Do yourself a favor, avoid this airport like the plague. Huge ripoff, money making scam. Should be illegal. I hope this airport gets shut down. Leeds-Bradford Airport Management YOU NEED TO DO BETTER. THIS IS SHAMEFUL.",1
"I've used this airport at least 50 times over the last ten years. It just gets worse.
It's now basically Wetherspoon's with a runway, departures is full of drunks at 7AM. Very unpleasant if you're traveling with kids. Arrivals is no better, I am typing this to pass the time at the baggage carousels where I've been for over an hour without any explanation.
Go to Newcastle Airport if you can.",1
"The dirtiest airport in the world, not only it is filthy but the security staff also target only certain people/colours. Only certain people get stopped on a regular basis even when wearing trainers. Even when you have not triggered any walkthrough alarm, still another scanner is applicable to certain colours. The owner needs to review the dirty tricks of the private firm hired for security. Airline staff are polite and cooperative, however the airport itself not clean and the security staff at check in points are clearly dirty.",1
Flying from this airport 4th time this year and my perfume bootle was 100ml since today was everything ok but unfortunately one young lady can’t recognise 100ml bootle and a bit less than half of bootle is used since Jan this year. So far was good but £120 perfume gone coz someone can’t recognise simple thing like 50ml of liquid in 100ml bootle🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻,1
"We were really excited to go for our day trip to Dublin. Our Ryanair flight was at 6:35 we got to the airport for 3am, myself, my partner & my son who is 4. We were queing out of the door just to pass through security. 2.5 hours later queing. We went to our gate & they let people in. It was absolutely boiling in the room we were all waiting. We were waiting & waiting until I approached the lady checking us in through the gate. She said we will be able to board in 1 second. 20 minutes later a lady came through & said due to staffing issues this is why we were late boarding, so they let the jet 2 passengers on before us even though their flight was at 7am. Literally leaving the Ryanair fliers high & dry because @jet2 take priority
The same lady then told us we were delayed because the tyre was flat & they needed to repair it. The lady telling us this also said ""they decided to do this at the last minute"" anyway after nearly an hour being delayed & waiting to board the flight. We finally got on. The Ryanair captain apologised & said the delay was down to staffing issues. They were lying & trying to cover their tracks. On the way home from Dublin no issues, but we get to Leeds Bradford airport & we were sat waiting on the plane for 20 minutes for the ladders to come to let everyone off the plane, again Ryanair again left high & dry. The bus & everything else was there just not the ladders. Absolutely horrific experience @leedsbradfordairport noone knows what's going on & what to do in the ""staffing issues"" If you treat all your airlines/staff the same, maybe you wouldnt get so many bad reviews & have people leaving also you have. Absolute Shambles!",1
"First time in many years we flew into LBA and it was a total shambles, Poor overall experience due to delay on the runway waiting for a driver to turn up to lead the plane to space, normal ques at passport control but they did have every stAtion manned and a complete disaster in delivering passenger cases.

Over 2 hours (nearly as long as our flight 🤬)from landing to getting cases which were left on the runway and then loaded on the wrong belts and not one member of staff around to take control.

This is what happens when you sack people instead of looking after your staff.",1
Travelled from Leeds Bradford today. What a shambles it is. Not enough staff. Queues were a mile long. People not getting to their planes on time. Weren't very helpful to people with disabilities like Manchester Airport are. My plane left 30 mins late having to wait for everyone to board. I don't think I will travel from Leeds again. Manchester Airport all the way,1
"@LBA this would have been a 5star review as I'm very impressed with the new facilities but it's a shame despite all your effort and investment to improve LBA and the travel experience that you choose to partner with the Nova Taxis (trading as Arrow Taxis).

They are an absolutely useless taxi company, LBA should get rid of these then as soon as possible. They can't provide a proper receipt when you book at the booking office and they delete your account after all pre-booked journeys so again you can't get a proper receipt. They are using the name Arrow Taxi but they are actually Nova Taxi Nottingham so not to be confused with other Taxi companies called Arrow Taxis",1
Long stay cat park is horrible gave us a late fee of £255 (even though we weren't late) and there was no number to call. Also the original payment for staying was £132 which we PAID so in conclusion it's cheaper to just take a taxi there and not leave your car there.,1
"bad location, bad access, expensive parking, parking mafia, you pay for parking at the airport, someone drive your car, when you come back the car is at the opposite end of Leeds, 15 miles from the airport.  Bangladesh airport is better",1
"What an absolute shambles. Waited for buses to arrive so we could leave the plane, driven around in circles back to the same location. Waiting for immigration clearance at 07:30 and they basically couldn't run a bath let alone an airport. Is it time to close LBA?",1
"This is one of the worst airports I have  visited it’s dirty, on other airports cleaners are constantly going round the outside corridors have weeds and rubbish.
The airport lounge is also bad cold food and no one clears up.
Once the new facilities are available I may return. The only thing is unless the management changes it will get to the same state.
Not really worth the 1 star",1
"Appalling security service! They never open more than 2  gates, and the waiting times are ridiculous. Very stressful and negative experience! I almost lost my flight because of them even though I was there 2 hours before departure time. They just don't care!",1
My flight got delyed 15 hours yesterday on the screen it said delayed 30 min then 30min then 30min again and again my flight was ment to be at 6.00 in the moring then my flight was at 9.00 at night and we had to change airports to Manchester it was a horrible experience,1
"Air port is in bits and in need of a drastic refurbishment to bring it back up to date, it can't cope with the volume of foot traffic for size of the airport when there are delays. Not to talk about the incompetent maintenance staff who can't keep the aircrafts in safe flight conditions when Severe weather warnings for the last 3 weeks.",1
"Beware! It costs £6 to simply get dropped off /picked up outside the airport. Money grabbing, corrupt behavior from this and all U.K airports.  Disgusting!",1
£6 for 5 min to pick up from airport is a complete rip off. The free area is too far away to drag luggage to especially when it's pissing it down. They couldn't put the free drop off area in a more inconvenient part of the complex without digging a moat round it and filling it with sharks. Greed simple as.,1
"FR2482 the worst experience in the UK so far. They left us standing in ice cold wind and rain for 20+ minutes at 5.25am in November !!!! before letting us board the plane. No apologies, no anything! Awful awful",1
"Awful airport.  Staff miserable and rude and the whole place is filthy. I cringe whenever I set foot inside. The prices are extortionate and the parking charges are an absolute rip off.  GREED, GREED AND YET MORE CORPORATE GREED. The Directors should be embarrassed by having this as their legacy!  ...",1
"It's all about the money it seems. Drop off charges shouldn't be allowed. The price of food and drink is obnoxious. 1.79 for a packet of crisps. Just because it's an airport shouldn't mean everything becomes expensive and we shouldn't have to accept it. The food and drink places are expensive too and the quality is very ""meh"" and not reflective of the cost. Sadly it's a captive audience.",1
"Cramped, claustrophobic and poorly run would be my summary. Took 80 minutes to get luggage after an hour flight from Amsterdam during which time nobody provided any updates to the people in the baggage hall who were essentially held hostage, resulting in a £20 parking fees to those picking me up. Want proof? Look at the time of landing in the picture and the current time and in the background the roller shutter door is just starting to raise. There were no other in bound flights waiting for their luggage the entire time. What a rip off! The low ceilings and poor air movement make it stuffy and claustrophobic. There's a general grime to the whole place that gives the impression that it's not well up kept or maintained. Feels more like a 70's bus station. Employees have a ""not my department"" attitude. For many, this is a first impression of Yorkshire and I don't think it's a fair or representative one. Management should be ashamed.",1
"An absolute disaster of an airport. Been flying out of here for years and never seen it so bad. Passengers all crammed into a massive security queue, two and a half hours long, no public announcements either. Jet2 staff were occasionally calling out flights (I counted 3 flights) to allow some passengers to cut into Fast Track. Ryanair passengers were left high and dry, and were seemingly told by airport staff to skip the queue, causing fighting among passengers. Missed a flight after arriving 3 hours in advance due to this mismanagement and over-scheduling nonsense.",1
"Vile airport, the bar is an absolute filthy disgusting rip off, wouldnt given my dog the food from there! Staff are rude, wont clear tables or even try to wipe them.. never flying from this cesspool again!!",1
"I had a truly appalling experience with Wajid, the security employer at Wizz Air Leeds Airport he got angry that I was paying attention to how he was talking to an elderly person(his words to the elderly person''you are in England and you don't know how to speak English, it seems incredible to me'' , he refused to take my luggage and pulled me out of queue, categorically refusing to serve me anymore . Not only did he refuse to take my baggage, but his behavior towards an elderly person was abhorrent and blatantly racist. His dismissive attitude and disrespectful demeanor were utterly unacceptable. I strongly advise against any interaction with Wajid or his establishment.",1
"I'm sorry to say this about my 'local' airport but my recent visit was not enjoyable at all. The airport is absolutely filthy, circulation spaces, toilet facilities and security were all in need of a deep clean. There seemed to be no fresh air being circulated, it was hot (on a relatively cool day outside) stuffy, stifling and smelled stale. Security staff were rude and one member of staff was bordering on aggressive, the way he spoke to people in the queue was appalling. Leeds Bradford Airport Management must try harder, bearing in mind the extortionate prices charged for parking, drop off, food and drinks, customers deserve better. This is not a good experience and an unpleasant way to start or end a holiday or business trip.",1
"I was at this Bradford airport for the first time, I stopped by car 5 seconds before entering to make sure I could go.  VCS took me to court, then to debt collection and I have to pay £270. This is nothing more than a hunt for drivers' money.
Stealing drivers.  And the stupid CCBC court approves everything.",1
I don’t feel comfortable flying from here when the check in staff don’t understand how airports operate. Although my experience was average this little Britain airport need to understand international airport operations.,1
"Awful airport now. Used to be quite pleasant, but is an awful experience now.

Far too many people rammed in to a small area, meaning there is nowhere near enough seating or areas to eat or drink. Always red hot too.

The past 3 times, we’ve been stuck sitting on the plane for over an hour due to not enough busses to ferry us off. This ain’t the airlines fault, but the airports poor management.

The past 2 times, we have been waiting over an hour for our luggage to appear on the conveyor belt. Poor service from Swissport, but the airport management should be addressing this, and they don’t seem to be.

I’ll certainly be looking to fly from Newcastle or Manchester from now on.",1
Absolute nightmare when flights are cancelled. I know its not their fault but they need staff there to tell passengers what to do. Swissport staff were invisible and when we did find them we were invisible.,1
I became somewhat disorientated (it occasionally happens at 82 years of age!) by the poor signage at LBA and so I briefly stopped to see which lane I should be in. The recorded time for stopping was 15 seconds. It was dark and neither my wife nor I were aware of any 'no stopping' notices. I appealed the decision to fine me for this 'gross error' on my part but to no avail. When I asked what LBA thought of this they stated that 15 seconds was a prolonged stopping time!,1
"Shock. Small grubby, especially the toilets. Nowhere to sit whe a couple of flight are due out. On arrival no toilets until you clear customs. All other airports I've used have these facilities. Took over 25 mins to clear passport control. If we had had small children with us needing toilets then this would have been horrendous. This airport is not fit for purpose as it is for large volumes of travelers. Needs flattening an starting again. No. Point them applying for any extension to flight until these issues have been addressed. 1 star is being generous.",1
"Flew out from this airport on many occasions and rarely had an issue getting away. Getting back however, is a very different matter.  You can expect upwards of 1.5 to 2 hours in a queue to get through passport control.  If you have a non EU or UK passport you would be through relatively quickly but if you have a UK passport you can expect lengthy queues and contempt from the border force",1
"A very small airport with very little to do. Unfortunately our flight was delayed by 12 hours, leaving us sat for 14 hours, with the shops running out of some food items. Their saving grace was the kind, friendly staff at both of the bars; they were talkative and reassuring.
Upon return, the airport were incredibly unorganised. We sat on the plane for 15 minutes, waiting for the steps to be attached. Once through security, we went to fetch our bags. They'd unloaded a different flight, who hadn't yet passed through security) onto the conveyorbelt for our flight. They then had 2 flights gathering round another belt. It was utter chaos. Will not be returning.",1
"The airport is great. But what isn't is the taxi service outside.
I got a taxi to the airport using my usual taxi company on Saturday morning £21.00.
Got a taxi home tonight using the only taxi company available outside. Arrow cars £39.38p.
Total rip off. Someone is doing something wrong.",1
"Awful, there was an accident and people had to wait over 3 h to leave the airport (which is OK), what is not OK is rude staff. Shouting at passengers, rude, not helpful (well they were very important showing power when they could). Woman shouting to leave the airport and wait outside... Just wow during huragan. What got me there were so many children crying.. One autistic boy staff treaded him awful. In the future I will make sure to avoid this airport, staff there is revolting. I gave you one star only because I had to. Man shouting at woman and kids *wow*",1
Possibly the worst airport in the UK! There is always something wrong causing delays or cancellations where taking off or arriving at the airport. They do not care about passengers at all. More than happy to keep you trapped on planes on the tarmac for hours on end while their inadequate processes are “put into action”. Set of 🤡🤡🤡 running the show,1
"Absolutely shambolic, massive queues,. a serious problem, this was the same in April and June, picture was taken at 5am. What a shame, as in the past it was a nice airport. The management needs to be more efficient and focus on customer requirements. Will not travel from here in the future.",1
Awful experience making our way up the escalator to Boarder Control at the top of the escalator  and the staircase the landing area became crammed. This resulted in people falling  into each other due to the escalator still running. I had to call down from the top for someone to press the stop button to avoid  an accident happening. This needs resolving before a serious  accident happens.,1
"Only one plane in and waiting for bags almost 30 minutes, ridiculous. Bad service as always",1
"Complete idiots running this show... had my lost bag for 4 days and could not get it out for delivery. I went to the airport  to pick it up and they said they think it was out for delivery. I said confirm it, they could not.  So they checked and found it still at the airport , they would have made me go home and back again.  They would not accept their error.  Supervisors  are extremely rude and clueless in the operations. There will be lots luggage stacked here and not moving to frustrated passengers.",1
"Please, sort the ladies w.c.'s in the arrival/suitcase collection area, they were absolutely disgusting last night, Sunday 11th Feb 2024.  Fuerteventura airport immaculate.",1
"Google should have a 0 star option, because 1 star is way to deserving of this sorry excuse of an airport. A week ago, we almost missed our flight due to a ridiculous security queue. When we returned 1 week later, we are stuck in another queue to enter the country. Even in this peak period, only 1 counter is open. It ridiculous how inefficient this airport is. If you have a flight here, I would recommend coming 4 hours in advance because you will most certainly be stuck in a queue for hours due to their sorry facilities. They are unequipped for a post pandemic and brexit travel situation. Avoid if you can, you're probably better off taking a train to London or something and taking a flight from there.",1
"Worst airport I ever flew from and I travel abroad frequently. Not fit for its purpose. Please see attached picture of the queue to security check. It started at the end of a car park. This kind of queues are a daily occurrence now so set off a day early! Planes regularly delayed. Airport is dated, often you need to climb a lot of stairs. Parking ridiculously expensive, like everywhere in the UK.  British should learn something from other international airports which are modern, have more facilities, helpful staff, special queues for families travelling with children. Shame on you!",1
"£6.00 to drop off 2 passengers, in and out of the car park in 3 minutes. What an absolute rip off by greedy LBA . Avoid .",1
"This airport is such a sad and depressing place to start your journey or holiday, most other airports make LBA look very dated and cramped, it’s in desperate need of replacement, poor facilities and overcrowding, with hardly any natural daylight and a nonexistent ventilation system it’s not a nice place to spend time waiting for your flight. The prices for food and drink are extortionate and offer very limited choice. On our return a week later the feeling was no better, the terminal arrival entrance was just as tired and depressing, a warm welcome to Yorkshire - I think not! The arrivals escalator seems to be either permanently switched off or broken. Come on LBA get yourself sorted and provide an airport worthy of Yorkshire.",1
"Absolutely abhorrent!!

Forced to stand in the pouring rain on the wettest day of the year waiting for a plane that hadn't even arrived yet

Update: Flight has now been delayed and we have been told to return to the airport where we have waited for over 2 hours with no update to our current schedule
Worst travelling days of my life",1
"The worst airport I've ever been to. Delays all the time. Staff don't seem to know anything or move quickly. Ground staff seem surprised when planes land.

Just waited 2 hours to get off plane and through security. Kids crying everywhere and no priority queue for families. Everywhere else I go they help get kids through.

My wife picked me up and had to pay £54 in parking charges due to the delay. Not fit for purpose.",1
"The actual airport itself has improved a bit but hoping this will help people who don’t want to get ripped off by the taxis there.

We got an Uber for our outgoing flight and the driver told us £5 of our fare would be to pay the drop off fee. The whole fare cost £16.

After our incoming flight arrived, I went to book a taxi with the airport’s partner company Arrow cars. The quote was £28 even though I presume they don’t have to pay the fee. We walked 5 minutes to just outside the No-stopping zone and got an Uber for £11.

Never seen an airport with so many drop off restrictions!",1
"Unquestionably the worst airport experience I have had. A busy June day simply overwhelmed the airport. Check in and security were good, but past that the airport is just too small for the volume of passengers. Not only were there massive queues to get anything, there was nowhere left to sit and not even any space left to sit on the floor near a wall. The staff there were doing the best they could, but it must be a tough place to work some days. Significant investment and expansion needed.",1
"It’s local to me, but has to be one of the worst airports in the country. It’s dated, dirty and swings from being pleasantly calm — very occasionally — to rammed with so many people they literally don’t fit in the terminal. The security staff are a joke. They have no idea what they are doing. They have one guy waving everyone through the metal detector which alarms every time and tells them to keep moving anyway and another guy who is checking through hand luggage trying to argue with me that a solid deodorant stick is classed as a liquid or gel… I travel all over the world with the same stuff in my hand luggage and airport security has never tried to tell me a solid is a liquid before.",1
"Awful experience. Went to pick my partner up from an early flight. Had never been here before but googled the 'Free car park pick up' and it took me straight through the main drop off on Google maps. I then stopped for less than a minute to let my partner get in the car and drove out having paid £6 for the pleasure of being in there less than a minute. 3 weeks later i received a fine from the company the airport works with who have cameras everywhere. £100 fine for stopping less than a minute to let my partner get in the car, no signage anywhere to say this isn't allowed or what the payments are in the drop off area. You go in blind. No cars behind me or in front of me so i wasn't holding anyone up. The company the airport work with is well known for being con-artists, VEHICLE CONTROL SERVICES LTD. If you google them you will see. Very disappointed and will not be using this airport again. Liverpool or Manchester are much better. Drop off at Manchester is £5 and it's a bigger city??",1
Just at the airport at 6pm on a weekday. The bars are a disgrace. Tables covered in glasses and hardly a table free that isn’t already used and filthy. What an awful place to start a journey. Hardly any staff to do the clearing and those that are working seem to prefer standing chatting than actually getting on with making this a more pleasant place. And don’t get me started on the appalling prices for this privilege. And no internet connection either.,1
"Security queue on the way out, awful.

Tiny airport inside with limited options.

Way home, landed, then no shuttle bus for 30 minutes, sat waiting on the plane.",1
Was picking my daughter and friend up at 10.20pm took the wrong turning and wasn’t able to turn around and had to go into pick up drop off but actually wanted the free for one hour car park i stopped to read the sign in car park then drove straight out and was charged 6.50 for been in there a minute and half I think it’s disgusting,1
"This has to be the worst airport in England
Thousands of people No were to sit air conditioning not working to unbelievable
Time to find a better airport I would rather drive 2 hour than fly from Leeds and Bradford it’s a safety hazard about to happen",1
"Really rubbish parking and expensive, I have complained to the airport about their parking management company (VCS of course) but they've just ignored my complaint. I will be complaining to my MP as well as someone needs to do something about these rip offs",1
"One of the worst airports in the world.
Pretty grim but Passport control and security is so far behind other European countries.",1
"Without doubt in the running for the worst UK airport, from the poor over priced food in restaurants to the lack of space and seating. Special mention to the downstairs bar which during a 1 hour delay and sat waiting they managed to not clean one table. At arrival it takes over 2 hours to disembark, clear the border and collect bags. Amazing how one airport can get every step of the way wrong.",1
"My wife drove through the drop off zone to let me out and for a final hug to her and our kids. Took all in all 3 min! Airport charged 6£, although sign said 10 min are for free. Nobody there, nobody to talk to. Commercial scam!",1
"Awful airport, when arriving from krakow we were stuck on the plane for about an hour. Apparently the ground team “had forgot about us” nothing was organised and hopefully I will never return.",1
"I recently used the parking services at Leeds Bradford Airport on 18/06/23 and was extremely disappointed with the exorbitant charges I incurred. The advertised hourly rate was £13, but to my dismay, I was charged £28 for my parking duration.

This significant price difference came as a shock and left me feeling deceived as a customer. I expected transparency and fair pricing, but this experience has left me questioning the integrity of their parking services.

To make matters worse, when I tried to address this issue by contacting the phone number provided on the receipt, I encountered severe frustration. I made over 100 attempts to reach them, but no one answered the phone. This lack of responsiveness only added to my growing dissatisfaction.

As a frequent traveler, I value prompt and efficient customer service when facing such concerns. Unfortunately, the unresponsiveness of Leeds Bradford Airport’s customer service team has left me feeling unheard and undervalued.

I hope that Leeds Bradford Airport takes this feedback seriously, not only regarding their exorbitant charges but also their customer service practices. Improving communication channels and addressing customers’ concerns promptly is vital for establishing trust and maintaining a positive customer experience.",1
Here now. Flight landed 1hr 20 minutes ago. Still no sign of any suitcases. Have been waiting an hour in baggage collection. Sort it out! Be quicker to drive back from Manchester then wait here this long.,1
Horrible checking experience. One person turned late to check in for KLM 10.10 flight. Checking 8 05 but one there for about 15 mins with long q for a full plane. Second person eventually turned even later. At checking we were told our small carryon not possible must go in hold. So we had to rearrange it and use a bag they gave us. Doing this of course delayed everybody behind us. When we boarded lots of carryons were seen to be going on the plane. Including one that was too big to go in overhead locker and was taken away to be put in the hold. We are in our 70s and felt discriminated against and very badly treated. LBA Leeds blinking Awful.,1
"I have never had such a bad experience at an airport like Leeds Bradford!  It is very dirty and chaotic.  On arrival we had to go to a very small baggage carousel where luggage from three flights had to be collected.  On the return flight to Schiphol, it turned out that there were far too few seats.  Then only two desks were opened for check-in.  The other desks remained closed.  It was very slow and the staff clearly thought that was very funny.  At security I had to take off my slippers, very inconvenient with gout.  I was also not allowed to bring a bottle of water and my bag was checked for drugs, unbelievable.  After I had handed in my shoulder bag I had to go back to the back of the queue.  The staff is super unfriendly and unprofessional.  Even after me and a colleague went to eat something, we suddenly had to go to another room because they wanted to clean.  There was no indication in the lounge from which gate we would fly.  It was very stuffy.  In the end I saw in the app which gate it was, while there was still nothing to see on the board.  Even the pilot I met knew nothing.  The flight was also delayed an hour.  In short, a very poorly functioning airport.",1
"Security was terrible slow. Only 1 of 4 scanners open. They don't have the modern scanners you have in other airports like T2 in Dublin. So, you need to take electronics and liquids out.",1
"The experience at Leeds Bradford does not make an enjoyable start and finish to the holiday. The drop off costs £6 or being dropped off a fair walk from the airport through scruffy carparks with unclear signage or advice on how far the wall is. As we were boarding, we had to walk along a wet mucky walkway to get to our plane and we were ok as fit and well but elderly and limping passengers looked like it was a lot of unnecessary effort...cmat imagine what this would be like on a really cold day for them. On arriving back to Leeds it was a fast turn around for baggage so we decided to use the Arrow taxi service who are the only ones allowed to use the main entrance to the airport...must have some contract with them. We tried to book Arrow cars and what would have been £18 fare with Uber was going to be £38 with exact same journey with Arrow. We then walked back along the scruffy unmarked long trail to the short stay 1 hour free pick up parking area which was chaos. We've had much better starts and ends to holidays at other airports which is such a shame as Leeds Bradford is our closest.",1
"Having travelled to 5 continents, LBA has distinguished itself as the worst airport I’ve ever been to. Essentially it operates at a capacity 5x higher than what it can deliver including waiting on the tarmac for 45 min for a bus to transport us from plane to the terminal.",1
"In my personal opinion Airport staff is very very rude and unprofessional, especially people at Ryanair's booth. Place is very crowded, so hundreds of passengers waiting for their planes have to stand, as there's not enough sitting spots on the airport. Will avoid this airport whenever it's possible. Parking is very expensive.",1
"Far too small for an International Airport. Going out, no air conditioning and packed to the rafters uncomfortable. Poor communication on flights and gates. Coming back, left on the runway for 45 minutes for a bus to take us walking distance to the terminal and chaos in the bagage reclaim area, several flights on one reclaim finally split into the other spare. The Operations Management and Executives need to either leave I’d full their fingers out, an extremely poor experience.",1
"The worst airport in the country, no doubt about it.
The staff at check in are polite and efficient and that’s where the good ends.
Security are utterly useless, zero efficiency and the place stinks.
Don’t bother ordering food or drink at the bar as you’ll miss your flight if you wait for them, 50 mins for some microwaved food then no response as to when the drinks will arrive… just a shrug of the shoulders.",1
"We arrived from Cyprus last night at 21.10 and from arriving to leaving the airport it took 1.30 minutes to get through customs and collect our luggage, this is not unusual at this airport, if they continue to treat customers like this many will look for alternative routes. Jet 2 staff are always excellent going over and above there duty helping to try and speed up the boarder force queues which is not there job. 6 flights arrived after ours so I would hate to think how long they had to wait to exit  the airport. It’s not only landing that’s a problem the whole experience is horrendous over priced food and drink served in dirty cramped conditions, I have waited 3 hours earlier this year to get though the airport. I will using Manchester & Liverpool when ever possible in the future.",1
"Just the worst airport you can fly in and out from. Long cues for security. No staff to bus passengers off the plane. Long waits in all areas. The airport is filthy dirty and needs a clean. No real places to sit when waiting for your flight. Out buildings are used as gates like something from the 60s.

Its hands down the worst UK airport I've flew from.",1
"What was once an excellent airport has declined over recent years. Car parks are extortionate, now £67 long stay cheapest for a week and at least 15 minute walk to terminal or wait forever for non existent bus. Better still use sentinel for £54 and 3 minute transfer. Airport lounge is always rammed by on the beach holiday makers who are given free access as part of their package, so impossible to book a place or use for business purposes. Airport itself has given up seating space, sacrificing travellers comfort, to more retailers and bars. It’s like Leeds city centre on a Saturday night. People now sit on floors at busy times. Thank goodness jet2 make check in a travel a better experience.",1
"****Winner 2024 “Worst Airport” award****

Congratulations LBA, for yet again, claiming this award for the third year in a row! Even with expectations already in the gutter, you still manage to find a way to make the entire experience terrible!

Once you have parked your car in the overpriced, “on-site” car park and wheeled your case the 900m across a building site, rocky terrain avoiding the broken traffic cones, having destroyed your luggage-wheels (because trolleys, or heaven-forbid, a smooth surface would be far too convenient), you finally arrive at the terminal building, where not one, but two automatic doors are out of order (the same two that have been out of order since 2019…..quite the achievement). The next task is the baggage check-in challenge! Once you have used one of the 2 automated baggage label scales (this time, a record 6 were “out of use”) and affixed your tag, you can then drop your bag with the one Swissport employee on shift! But wait, if you’re lucky enough to have oversized baggage (in my instance, golf clubs), then you are faced with the “oversized baggage” corridor of uncertainty! Here, you will be directed down a dark corridor with an unlocked cleaning cupboard (a dream for those wishing to leave “suspicious items”), a cleaning trolley and more notices pinned to the wall than a missing-person search, to then be faced with the shutter of doom! You will wait, for 25 minutes while countless airport staff walk past, shrug their shoulders and say “not my job”…..while you wait, nervously wondering if you will indeed make the flight that you diligently arrived two-hours in advance of, you must find the one person in the airport that actually seems to have courtesy and common-sense! You will finally hand over your items to the person in oversized baggage, who will of course offer no apology or explanation for your lengthy wait and pray that they make it on to your flight….I’m just so pleased I paid extra for that oversized bag now!!

The next obstacle is security….I hit the jackpot as lucky me, they were testing the new 3D scanners! Now in theory, this should have been a breeze, but this is LBA, they are fighting for “worst airport” award remember! Now you would think that as the new scanners were in ‘beta’ phase, they would at least open one of the other 3 lanes available to keep the flow of passengers moving, but where’s the fun in that?!?! Let’s let 300 people queue for the only scanning line open, with each bag having to go through twice to add to the fun! Of course when it is washed down with the free comedy entertainment provided by security staff (that actually makes you cringe in embarrassment), coupled with the seemingly “first time fliers” who still insist that “last time I was able to take this 2 litre bottle of vodka through”, a real treat awaits!

Once through, you can expect to find overpriced alcohol, poor seating and toilets that were in fact last cleaned in 1997.

As you board your plane through a converted bus-shelter and have managed to escape LBA, you can spend your flight working out why you didn’t spend the extra time driving to Manchester, Newcastle or East-Midlands, but then realise that you will soon have to, because hopefully the CAA closes LBA for good!",1
"We live in Sunderland and flew from here in aug 2023, never again!. The staff are very rude, the passengers, assuming from Leeds?.. are very selfish… my daughter in law was delayed 6 hours and had to feed my 8 week old grandson on the floor…not 1 person offered her a seat!. Selfish nasty ppl!. Will never use this airport again for the sake of saving any amount of money!.",1
"Really poor experience. Little to no waiting areas and with multiple delayed flights there were a crowd of people with no where to stand. Entire airport feels dirty and dingy. Men's bathroom had only two stalls for use despite being extremely busy.

Flight was delayed, which happens, but no announcements were made. Gate was changed, again with no announcements being made.  Our gate had no signs telling us if that was our gate or not leaving all passengers unsure of where they were meant to be.

Finally boarded 30 minutes after the delayed time  and despite having a front and back exit they only used the front exit meaning it took twice as long to get all passengers on the plane. Will actively avoid and pay extra to go to other airports",1
"I will never be using this airport again. Fined £60 for pausing to read the signs to figure out which car park to use. Paid £6 on the day for the privilege of picking up my friend. No other vehicles around, the whole thing took 5 minutes - all because I couldn't find the free parking.",1
"Over an hour to get through passport control, huge queues.
£6 extra charge for the taxi to drive through the short stay car park for less than 2 minutes.
Going to avoid in future.",1
"Absolutely awful airport - literally the worst I have been to - particularly if you’re using gate 9 or 10. Drive to Manchester - you’ll be glad you did. You know those guys that do the hobby steam train thing? Well, Leeds Bradford is as amateur as that but without the charm.",1
If you ever wish to visit Hell try this airport.   Air conditioning system was not on.  Various fans scattered around that churned the fetid air and did not help at all.    Overcrowded with insufficient seating. Four flights delayed meant all those extra people.  People in every clear spot on steps on floors.    No organisation once we got to the gate no differential made between those that paid extra for priority and everyone else we were crammed into a closed room that contained four chairs.    When I pointed out that people were upset by the lack of organisation I was told by member of service air that it wasn’t his responsibility or his job.   Will never fly to this airport again! Minus stars do not recommend,1
LBA airport just chaos no explanation why we are on a bus to Manchester. God knows what time we will  get into the air as all Manchester flight are showing delayed. Will not go from LBA again.,1
"Staff are lovely but their security system and bag scanning system is terrible. Only one scanner open, massive queues and absolute chaos for people trying to get through to catch a flight. The staff working there didn't seem to know how to cope with what was going on. There were bags piling up to be checked and one security guy was just emptying whole suitcases out into trays to be rescanned. Leaving people trying to repack suitcases at the end of the scanner. The place was chaotic and one security guy said to a group of people... ""you think this is bad, you should see what it was like at 7am this morning"". Implying it's usually worse. It would completely put me off flying back through Leeds airport again.",1
"It is so bad that we prefer to take an indirect flight to our destination from Manchester, rather than a direct flight from Leeds. Need I say more? Greedy, inconvenient access and awkward layout.
To add insult to injury, the airport staff is useless. Security have no brains and tons of arrogance. Seems that no one wants to work at this airport as they are constantly advertising for staff and half of them were in training. Worse still, the supervisors giving the training were clueless. Taken to the whole body search private room to be given a swab on my medical device. And apparently my shoes were still a security risk after being scanned so I was made to walk barefoot across the dirty floor to the private room for swabbing. Zero courtesy, zero common sense and full of arrogance. Prime example of a dumb a** given power beyond their cognitive abilities",1
"Dropped a friend off this morning at 04:45 hrs, was there approx 1m30s. Thought I had followed for the free parking drop off but no. Cost me £5:00.
I know the airport has to make money but £5:00 ! Is this clear signage I ask ?",1
"“Fast track” waste of money and time. Security also very unfriendly and uncaring to those travelling with children. Firstly, those in the non-fast track got through faster. Security were really unhelpful too, my 3yr old carries her blanket as a comfort item, she doesn’t understand why it has to be removed from her person which resulted in her crying and screaming. This is true of every experience I’ve had from travelling from LBA and I have not experienced similar problems flying from Manchester.",1
"The place is falling apart. Roof leaks in various places. Toilets stink. We went in a restaurant/bar and pretty much all the chairs we're ripped or stained allover, and the drinks we're expensive for the privilege of sitting on them. Damage marks on walls. Going through to departures was a nightmare, just chaos everywhere. People sitting on the floors which I wouldn't recommend as they we're filthy. The whole airport needs a refurbishment. I will not travel from there again.",1
"This has got to be the scruffiest dirtiest airport in the UK. Have they got rid of all their maintenance and cleaning staff???
Although... it has been for some time, at least 4 years the escalator where arrivals go up to security from the tarmac, hasn't worked. The toilets in arrivals when waiting for luggage are disgusting ( even worse than the toilets in departures past the saltaire bar going to gate 6).

Security is cramped and chaotic and pretty much every time you use the place you get the feeling like they have never done this before!!.
Have to say, this isn't the fault of the staff but poor management.

When leaving the airport you look back and see a sign ""Welcome to Yorkshire"" what an impression!!!

Shame there isn't a decent and clean airport in the area.",1
"1h 20 min queue to get through security, and many people had to stand outside of the airport as building just isn't big enough for having this many flights at the same time.... Flight display showing we're at gate 5 where it was actually gate 4, just nobody bothered to update it. Then 1 hour sitting inside the airplane waiting for some paperwork. All this drama from 6.30am to get on to 8.10am flight.",1
"First and last time I will ever fly from Leeds Bradford Airport. I have never been to such a dirty and messy airport in my life! I didn’t see ONE person cleaning at all. Every cafe and restaurant had rubbish everywhere it was disgusting! & they charge you £6 just for drop off, even if you’re only a minute or so! Never again.",1
"We're do I start , jet 2 you are brilliant  but you need to  move from Leeds Bradford  Airport  and  go to Doncaster  Airport  let's get it open  again  ,Doncaster  will look after  you.  The airport  is absolutely  scruffy,  we went  to burger King  for something  to eat spent a fortune  for dry unedible  burgers  ,staff look  like  they can't  be bothered,  nowhere to  sit tables  filthy , areas around  and also bad,  I watched  a worker clean a table  ,how can a square  table  be round  that's how he cleaned it  floor  disgusting  , he was so slow  I could  have done better, your paying  someone  for  doing  nothing  obviously  no pride  in there work.
Security  very assertive  and shouting at people  just  no need  it's supposed to  be an enjoyable  time going  on holiday  I know  they  have a job  to do but some of them  are definitely  jobsworth  . I  was so glad when our plane took  off and we were out of there.",1
"Far too many flights for the capacity of the airport. Toilets overwhelmed. Nappy bins full and overflowing. Queues for any refreshments at least 20 mins. Stock at all outlets low to non existent.

Won't use again :(",1
"Returned home to this airport at 2am, waited 50mins for cases and 20mins to get out of the collecting area. People blocking the exit whilst waiting for their cases. This area is far too small for this airport, frustrated people pushing and shoving. It was a nightmare.",1
Layout is horrible. Lacks seating unless going in to eat. Toilets are absolutely vile. Baggage claim entrance and exit is at the same side. Took an hour for luggage to come through. Road/pavements are a mess between official car park and airport with no trollies available.,1
"What an experience going to that airport , we dropped a friend off last night literally just dropped him off! when we followed the exit we came to a barrier and it said the cost was £6 to get out.
I didn't take my purse thinking I wouldn't need it so I had to go into the airport and find him to get some cash luckily I found him and he gave me £20 good job because when I got to the barrier the cost had gone up to £15!! Absolutely disgusting just to drop someone off what a rip off won't be dropping anyone else off!!!!
There making money anyway they can arsholes!!!!!",1
"Horrendous experience today! It was so hot and 2 flights were delayed, by hours, so the airport was so full. There were people everywhere, not possible to even find somewhere to sit on the floor. Security was chaos, hard to keep an eye on your belongings going through the machines. They need a contingency when flights are delayed, an overflow space or access to be outside like other airports.",1
"26th July, 1st time at Leeds airport and last. Not enough seats to cope with people. Slow at passportcontrol on  the homeward flight.
A week and a half after we returned recieved a letter and summons for stopping in a no stopping zone...
We couldnt find the carpark we were booked into. Driving around at 4am still dark. Pulled up to check google maps for approx 40 secs, no traffic, didnt get out of the car, as soon as carpark was located of we drove off..
100 quid but 60 if paid within 14days of issue, careful reading of the letter revelled that it took 11days to be delivered from the issue date. Never again....
Would rate no stars if I could",1
"************!!HATE THIS PLACE!!*************

This airport, although handy for me it is beyond fit for purpose. The staff are clueless and un welcoming. Went to the Saltaire bar for a coffee & some breakfast, you have to order from the table, but no internet signal so had to log onto the airport Wi-Fi and there was a problem with this too, absolute joke 🤣. The airport is scruffy and tired. There always seems to be work going on, but nothing seems to improve. Everytime I've landed here, the escalator on the way to passport control has hasn't been working (Not that i need it, but some will) the luggage hall is a dingy little hole, numerous belts but only 1 ever seems to be working 🙈. This place is far too small and unprofessional to be called an ""International Airport"" a bit of a shambles having to Que for the Gate upstairs at the top of the escalator, causes chaos for folk needing to go to gates down stairs or to the smoking area...ABSOLUTE DUMP..Yorkshires Airport. Management should be ashamed.😂😂😂😂😂😂👎👎👎👎👎...Manchester for me in future.....",1
Boarding crew were absolute as*es due to cabin luggage not fitting but 1cm (due to a wheel) into the Ryanair stand... Meanwhile people with holdalls and etc pass through freely. joke of a policy enforcement.,1
"What a shambles. Would have thought that after last year the airport management team could have got there act together. Saturday pm arrival,saw people in the hot sun lying on the ground waiting to board our arriving plane. How young children, the elderly or infirm managed is beyond me. Had to walk up broken escalator to passport control then had to wait over an hour for bags to be delivered, baggage area in too small for the numbers, baggage belts too small, 4 flights baggage scheduled on the same belt. Jet2 staff shouting out belt changes, buggys dumped near a door with no announcement found by chance. Poor signage,baby changing poorly signed everything needs an overhaul. Get a proper management team in or close in down and reopen Doncaster. Jet2 should move to Doncaster which is/ was the best airport in the country.",1
"Extremely long, excruciating queues that are mandatory to go through as soon as you arrive to the country.
We were hungry and we had to stand in line for 40-50 minutes before our documents were finally checked staring into windows of burger king that was inside of the airport.
The bus from plane to airport itself was also a joke because it refused to transport us unless it is as crowded and with as little space as possible.
And also no free wifi, yes, you're not just outside of your internet provider zone, but you also have 0 access to internet.",1
"Expensive rip-off for just dropping off a friend!

Went to drop off a good friend as a favour today. Followed signs for 1 hour free parking but only needed time to allow him to unload 2 cases. Signage so confusing (deliberately) that we followed the drop-off lane and ended up being charged £6 for about 3 mins.
Total Rip-off!",1
"Too small. Too many flights at any one  time . Means too many people in the airport, not  enough seating or space in general.
Very outdated",1
"Checked in today and was told my hand luggage had to go in the cargo hold all the way to Dubai as the flight to Schipol was full. I travel for business and explained that the contents of the unlockable hand luggage had important documents and basically my working life in it. I was offered an Air France tote bag to put it in by a very indifferent rude check in person. Luckily I had a small day sack in my luggage so managed to get the most important stuff in. ( wasn't offered the opportunity to drop the hand luggage off at the bottom of the staircase to the plane then pick up at Schipol). I got the same response from the 'supervisor'. Upon joining the plane it seems that different people had different experiences as i saw plenty of bigger hand baggage than the one I had in the people's possession. Very poor and inconsistent. I will ask my company to fly me from either Humberside or Durham in future  if possible. The rest of the airport was great, security was pretty slick too",1
The dirtiest airport I have used! The power sockets are turned off and the Wi-Fi doesn’t work. I’d only use it again if I had to! Staff at the Saltaire we good.,1
Security staff are really rude and verbally aggressive. They shout at you expecting you to automatically understand what they are saying. The most unpleasant experience. Security clearly lack customer service skills. They should work on some manners and customer service skills,1
"Check in and security are fantastic. The cabin restaurant is hell on earth. Rude horrible staff. Placed my order via qr code, waited 20 mins for a drink, went to the bar to enquire, rudely told my order hadn't gone thru. Thanks for telling me. Scum place, scum staff",1
"One of the worst airports I’ve been to. Understaffed, not enough facilities, queues for all eateries, filthy, no air con in key areas. Shambles !",1
"Soo excited to go for our holiday in Romania, especially my son. Recieved a notification that our flight is an hour delayed and arrived in time for the flight (the airplane was there for one more hour and something), but we were told that luggage checkers went home at 10pm and there is nobody available to check our bags… this was just shocking especially that we took into consideration that being with an 4 year old and 2 year old will help not spending 2 or 3 hours in the airport waiting for the late flight. We are so disappointed with their service 😔",1
Suspect I speak for most of the hundreds of passengers currently sat in the sweltering heat of this un-air conditioned hole of an airport planned by someone who it apparently didn't occur to that a few more seats might have been a good idea - what an absolute shower and disgrace to our county.,1
The worst airport I’ve ever been to!!! Because of the staff’s incompetence I missed my flight and was forced to stay overnight at the airport. The airport is completely not adjusted for working 24/7 like it claims. Entire night the shops were closed and no one had the access to water or something warm to drink. The stuff is also extremely unfriendly and unhelpful and myself’s and other passengers unpleasant experience was actually funny to the airport’s employees.,1
"What a rip off. Just reviewing as a family member picking up and dropping off but the car parking is beyond scandalous. We made a wrong turn, ended up being a one way into the drop off and bus/taxi lane. £6 minimum charge to get through or face a potentially massive fine turning round and going the wrong way down a one way street or through the bus and taxi lane. There's traffic monitoring cameras on the roads all around to spot if you stop without a genuine reason, with automatic fines issued. The hour's free parking is a 5 minute walk away, not too bad but it's £49 after that first hour. We looked into the cost of staying for an hour or two at the airport to stay with my mother in law rather than just dropping her at the door (a minimum £6 charge). £43 for the closest car park or £34 with a 'free' shuttle bus. Genuinely will never use this airport again, it's disgusting racketeering",1
"By far the worst experience I have ever had so far travelling from an airport.  This review reflects the poor quality of the services I have encountered from the moment I arrived to the moment my flight departed.

Parking:
I have opted for the premium short stay parking. First of all, does not make any sense, you are close to the terminal by a couple of hundred feet.
The parking is extremely poor signposted and with most of the roads being one way systems, if you miss the correct turn, you end up going through to the meet and greet, where you have to pay 5£ even to go through it. Which is easier said than done. The contactless/card payments did not work. I tried cash, only to be presented with a message saying that payment method is ineligible, but only after eating my 5£ note. So in the end had to call for assistance to get through.

Check in:
The number of check-in desk is grossly insufficient. 6 operating in total for the entire airport.
After queuing for a while we got to a desk eventually, and one of the agents started our check-in process, only to be interrupted mid-process by another agent on the phone with someone requiring access to the computer. With no explanation after 15 mins we were directed to another desk where we had to wait for another 15 mins before we started the process from scratch.
No explanation or apology issued for the delay.

Security:
We opted for the fast-track lane option on booking the parking. Which worked well, as we moved straight through to the front of the queue.
The attitude of the staff at the security was appalling. Asking for the boarding pass I presented the opened 1st of 4 boarding passes on  my phone. As we were travelling in a family group it was obvious that we were four of us. But because I only presented a pass, as this is the only way to access them on the phone, having to swipe for the rest of them, we were met with a  sigh and with a rude tone by the security agent who made the obvious observation saying “one...”. I explained that he needs to swipe right to bring on the next pass, which was obviously something the he already knew, at the end of the day that is his job and what he does all day. He than preferred to hand over the phone back to me for me to swipe for each pass while he waited impatiently for me to pass the phone back to him each time.
His colleagues at the next security check were not much better.

Gates:
The gates are extremely cramped with very few seats available far too few for the a normal flight most passengers having to stand in a very small space waiting to board the plane.

Nothing seems to be working smoothly over there, so the issues is not only one particular area but in all or most of them. I will avoid this airport in the future and I advice you do to if possible as it’s offer and appalling experience and an awful way to start any journey or holiday.",1
"Absolutely horrendous experience for a first time in Leeds Bradford Airport. We walked past the luggage carousel (along with another 5 passengers) as we had never been there before and saw no signage for it (could have been there but it obviously wasn't very big!!!) Once we realised where the luggage came off we couldn't get back in to get it.  We went to the information desk on at least 3 occasions but each time nothing changed - we still had to wait for a Swissport person to get our bags. We walked up and down the airport looking for ANYONE to help but to no avail. The only way we ended up getting our bags was when we stood at the exit door of the baggage reclaim and a guy who missed his flight was coming out and we could then get in to get the attention of 2 members of staff who were able to bring our bags to us.
My nephew came to pick us up and waited with us and his hour in the park was almost up when we ran to the car.
A very shabby customer service and very distressing for first time users of the airport particularly that no-one appeared to be in any way to be interestednin helping. Unfortunately we have to use the airport to go back home but will be flying into Manchester in future.",1
Lovely staff but the place is a Kip. For a small airport it’s extremely dirty mainly the departure lounge. Burger King is also a shambles,1
"My baggage was delayed and after taking my request at the counter, I never received a PIR number. Despite numerous reminders, I have not received any feedback. It was impossible for me to follow the progress of the retrieval of my suitcase and also impossible to file a complaint with the airline concerned.",1
"Utter shambles. I've seen more organisation on the last helecopter out of Saigon. Over two hours queuing to security which only had a single scanner working. If you are planning to use this apology of an airport for your summer holidays, I'd bring a tent.",1
"Unfortunately I am ashamed this is my local airport. The management should be ashamed they have allowed this airport to fall into a disgraceful disrepair & the attitudes of staff is horrendous. Travelled back last night to appalling attitude from all staff, not one smile not one hello it was a couldn’t give two cares attitude! Great introduction to Yorkshire. A poor young boy was unwell the security staff would not allow him out of the line to use the toilet or sit down on the seat, unfortunately he ended up vomiting everywhere. His parents were told it’s not my authority to allow him out of the line!! Wow!! Customer service at its finest. They still didn’t help the boy or his parents just looked at them in disgust! There was no lift available after our departure from the place for the disable passengers & parents with young children. Had to climb 4 flights of stairs. No staff helped certain passengers helped the people in distress.  The airport is clearly not fit for purpose for the amount of air travel coming through & for what should be clear health & safety requirements. Flying from Manchester in December now. I’d rather pay extra to travel there & back to at least get a smile!",1
Aircon is off. Toilets are filthy. Half the visa machines don’t work. Restaurants have half the menu displayed. Wifi dosnt work. The security area is a joke. So much investment is needed into this airport,1
"Very disorganised and unprofessional. Nowhere near enough seating and the temperature is far too hot in the terminal. We got to the gate, everybody went through and then they said we all had to go back out because they ""had run out of busses"". So back into the hot and cramped terminal with no updates. Gate staff were friendly but the senior (older) gate staff who came along were not friendly, rude and condescending. Over 45 mins later we went to a different gate and then stood for over 20 mins in a corridor...",1
"Avoid at all costs!!!

This is hands down one of the worst airports I've ever been in.

Getting off the plane, none of the escalators work, so you have to carry your luggage on multiple flights of stairs.

There were 5 planes landing at the same time, and the border control was manned by 2 people, without any automatic gates. Spent 1 hour in the queue.

The baggage hall is small and extremely crowded.

Once you manage to get out of the airport there are no cabs waiting, you need to have one pre-booked, however you can't really pre-book one as you never know how long the border control and baggage queues are going to last (probably several hours, longer than the actual flight).",1
"Baggage control workers are rude and surly despite my best efforts.
£8.99 for a small glass of wine?  No thanks",1
"Our flight has been cancelled due to weather conditions. Crew disappeared, nobody gave any informations for long time, then Airport stuff with unclear and rude way informed that we have to go back downstairs. Airport not prepared for emergency situations. Ryanair don’t have even one person responsible for emergencies. We slept on the floor, but there was not too much space left for so many people. Disgraceful.",1
"Only flight in and landed it took longer than the flight from Amsterdam to get through boarder control. 3 staff 8 booths with 3 mangers looking on 55mins to get to luggage, but amazingly when you decided to staff all 8 booths how quick the queue went down. Good job it wasn’t busy",1
"Worst Airport I've been to. Just one huge bar, full of drunk people, staff unfriendly and rude, not family friendly at all, unorganized, dirty, we had to sit on the floor with our baby and toddler being kicked by people walking past, when asked for seating anywhere we were told to go sit on the floor as no seating. Honestly I was shocked to how bad it was. Completely ruined the start and end of our holiday as first and last place you go, on way back to our car the bus driver was shouting at a disabled family with a baby because there wheel chair was in the way and he didn't want to do another run so needed them to move so he could squish more people on. He was shouting at passengers and swearing! Absolute disgrace. Will not use again!

If you have small children do not use this airport! Malaga airport was amazing Leeds take note on how things should be done!",1
"Been here several times now, fantastic service - friendliest staff, used to be short queues for anything, but at the moment it's an absolute shambles as security is 50% blocked off behind construction walls. Well over an hour for security in the AM and disgustingly high fast track charges. AVOID LBA until construction is complete....",1
"1.5h for security, then only because we were bumped up to fast track. 4 lanes, only 2 open. Disorganised but it never gets better.",1
Needs upgrading.  All steps off the planes and then three lots of stairs into the terminal.  How disabled people manage heaven knows.  Long waits at passport control.  The car park is hugely expensive for anyone picking you up.  The barriers fail and take your credit card.  Poor management and poor quality for an important airport.  Very sad.,1
"This airport has honestly only gotten worse. I have no option but to travel from leeds as it is closest but it is terrible. When getting off of your plane and waiting for your luggage, there are many flights and you wait no less than 40 minutes. And as for staff, 99% of them are just as horrible as the airport and couldn’t care less about any parking or trains you have from the airport at a certain time, so if you are late, they seem it as your fault for not booking/setting a later time. Also, the Jet2 staff are by far the most horrible as usually when collecting baggage, Jet2 have priority, no matter how much later their flight landed. At the claiming point, it often gets very crowded as no less than 3 flights are to pick their luggage up from any of the 4 belts. I have no idea whether there is not enough staff however in my case i was waiting 40 minutes for my bag and decided to speak to a member of staff and to no suprise he had not helped me, in the end i waited an hour for my bag and missed both of the trains i had booked. I recommend to travel an hour or two extra to a different airport than to waste time at leeds.",1
"Paid for parking and received a fine.  Some bays are not marked as no parking so they fine people daily for this.
We got photos showing that there where no signs to say not park there but they still upheld the fine. We have looked several times and always someone parked in those bays, all of them get a fine.  Disgusting service when we had already paid £90.00 to park there.
This needs addressing and signage put in place.",1
"The worst airport in the world… I had the flight at 23:30, being there at 22:06 and they didn’t let me amd my family pass because  “WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PERSONAL STAFF IN SECURITY TO SEARCH YOU BECAUSE ALL OF THEM WENT HOME, BECAUSE THEY FINISH THEIR SHIFT AT 22:00”
This is just unbelievable for a airport they are suppose to be 24/7 like every each airport in the world. The guy from reception ask me why I didn’t check their website to see at what time they security finish their shift? 😂😂
So we lost the flight + another 10-12 people…but  the airplane departed at the normal schedule.
Never ever on that airport and I gonna make them a claim.😡😡",1
"The worst airport ever. They show the flight gate number with just 30-40 minutes before departure which it's the same time with gate closure, and if you find the gate in the last 20 minutes you have huge chance not to be allowed to embark because even the staff have ZERO respect for customers.I know to many people who lost their flight for this scammers.
AVOID AVOID AVOID this mockers!!!",1
"Return home so disappointed with service, I need assistance waiting on plane approx 40 to get off after others left the plane, then just left once through security,  my husband had to push me plus manage 2 suitcases, we arranged meet and greet parking but on getting to their station obviously flustered overwhelmed, given keys saying we were 25 hours overdue???? No help to car just it's in bay B - we got lost in rain and wind struggling with cases,, really not what we expected as going out couldn't fault it, but coming home almost in tears so stressful will definitely try to avoid using this airport again",1
"Pick up and drop off is £6!! And it sneakily doesn't tell you right up until you arrive and have no way to back out.
They claim all the parking measures are for safety, but it's clearly a money making scheme.",1
"Terrible service and not child friendly at all, no family lane in passport control so we stood almost 30min in a huge lane holding a cranky baby in our arms. If they want to be considered a big efficient airport there is a lot of work to be done.",1
"Dirty, disorganised. It appears that staff have limited motivation to do their job in any capacity. It was very unpleasant that I couldn't find a clean table in ANY restaurant. No proper air con. Each time I visit I wish to walk to my travel destination instead of flying from Leeds Bradford Airport. What a disappointment.",1
"Parked at the meet & greet to collect my wife & charged 14 quid for half an hour. Feels as though I am a victim of a robbery. Disgraceful profiteering by the airport, taking advantage of the good will of customers relatives & friends.",1
Poorly managed. Absolutely no sense of urgency. It's not a European standard airport. Forget punctuality or adequate staffing. Not to mention the fact that it's surprisingly difficult to get to. Oh and one more thing - A taxi to and from Leeds city centre will cost you more than a flight to a European city 🤣,1
"To small airport for operate that many contractors. No enough equipment for all around the airport. It may be due to busy time, but if you sign new contractors - buy new equipment. Waiting 30 minuts for bus to bring me to the terminal after landing is a joke!",1
Woefully under staffed.  Nearly 2 hours just to get through security which had just 1 lane open.  Then have to run 10 minutes to gate which didn’t even open until 15 minutes after we were told it closed.  Had to wait in a shed which only had 1 toilet with no light.,1
"So. Where do I begin. We arrived to the airport more than 2h before the flight. Went through security very quickly.. it felt like a breeze until we missed our flight for the first time ever. We travel a lot and we have never had an issue like this before. We were waiting for our flight in one of the restaurants. A bit past 6am we got up and walked towards where we thought our gate was but it turned out it was the opposite direction. Our gate was due to close at 6:15 and we walked up to it at 6:20 so we were hoping someone would be looking for us for those 5 minutes as we were checked in early. Nope. Everyone was gone, no announcements, nothing. Asked one of the workers if there was any chance they could let us through, only got an abrupt no. In the past I have seen many people let through the gate 10-15 minutes before departure . I feel like it is so unfair  that we could not be let on our flight only because we came to our gate 5 minutes late even though there have been maaaany instances where there is still queue through the gate whilst the gate is closed in the past. I believe we had plenty of time to get on the plane as it only departed 35 minutes after we came to the gate. I definitely feel like we have been treated very unfairly and nobody made any effort to get us on that flight.",1
Arrived of an our flight this evening and head for security. As we continued down the corridor the doors were locked not allowing us through. Lights off and No staff around at all so waited 10 minutes for someone to appear and then another 10 mins while they found someone who could open the door! Finally got through to security who didn’t even know we had been stuck and no apologies.,1
Our flight was delayed by a long way and in the end we were forced to stand outside in a queue for a long time with freezing temperatures. the whole experience of this airport is as if it was being run by a local landlord. The bar staff don't know how to read an allergen menu and airport staff have no clue what is going on with flights. Hands down the worst airport I have been too. If you have the option to fly from anywhere else even for money please do so. (I also had a glass of prosecco here for £11) the prices are stupid for such a poorly run airport. I don't think I can express how bad it really is.,1
Awful. Never had a worse experience than at Leeds Bradford Airport on 2nd September.  It seemed that there weren't enough staff in any area to handle the volume of passengers travelling. Get your act together management.,1
"First time here. Disgusting. The toilets were appalling. The smell off the toilets would have knocked a buzzard of its perch at a 100 yds. In general, the whole place is filthy. The Meet & Greet staff barely had a clue about how to get from the airport to Leeds.",1
"Absolutely appalling.
We were put on a bus from jet 2 flight and left on the bus for 25 to 30 minutes freezing cold, no explanation given until passengers got angry. The driver then said it was border control who said we could not leave the bus.
When inside the airport none of the escalators were working and some people were struggling on the stairs with bags.
One small lift was working accomadating 2 people but there were no staff to point out where the lift was, hidden away in a corner.
Passengers were affected with ongoing travel plans . No communication, no apologies.",1
"Amateurish outfit;
- No bus to collect us from the plane
- UK Border/passport control operating at 50% capacity (4 out of 8 stations)
- Only 1 bus operating for long stay car park (driver had been working for 12 hours)
Plane arrived 0130 finally got into long stay car park at 0330. Scheduled flight should mean airport is ready for the things it has to do  - Prior Preparation and Planning Prevents P* Poor Performance!",1
Suppose to fly to NEW York this morning to be told we need  green card ..the staff were appalling ignorant and had no intention of helping us ..an absolute disgrace of an airport and the staff want sacking ..my partner is heartbroken ????,1
"The worse Airport in UK, and you can see why... So outdated terminal building   where planes not even outside but have to walk a long way. Security check is so bad you queue all the way to the Jet2 side of the building. Saltaire bar and Cabin bar unable to serve food quickly 40 min wait for food is unacceptable. Half the menu missing. Flights delayed half day with no information until finally cancelled. Unreliable Airport.",1
"Simply the worst airport experience in the world. Had to use this place 3 times this year and never fails to disappoint.

Departure area - crowded and dirty with eye-watering bar prices but that's nothing compared to landing and having to queue for passport and bags. The fastest we have made it through is 1 hrs 5 mins.

Whoever is running this place should be ashamed. Wherever you have a choice vote with your feet and avoid it.",1
The building is falling to pieces. There are leaks everywhere. Not enough seating and very dirty etc. I would dread being in this airport during peak summer season if it is maintained to the same standard. The airport feels closer to a sticky nightclub to an airport.,1
"Shocking airport. All money spent on duty free department!  Long walks understand dirty tram shelters.  On return, long walks outside in all weather, filter, then up 3 flight of steps, carrying luggage, before joining huge passport queues!  Looks like an airport ready for closing down.  I use it at least 10 times a year!  No changes.",1
"Chaos, its toosmall to cope with increased  number of passengers.
On return captain apologised for delay as had left lba earlier in a chaotic mess.
Had to wait on plane as no bus to disembark passengers
Collecting baggage is a joke bags got stuck on conveyor causing pile up of luggage
Don't park on airport bus runs very sporadically",1
"Didn't like it at all. Staff are working very hard but unfortunately they are not quite right causing unnecessary delays and stress. They handed to me a tiny bag for all the fluids, as they said my 20 cm X 20 cm was too big. 20 cm X 20 cm is exact size as airline and Leeds airport website states. Then when I barely managed to fit everything in, they asked to zip it. That was by the way for two of us travelling, but they let my son through when I was repacking and then said where is another passenger? Well, was here a second ago, but you asked him to go through when I was repacking!!
No priority boarding has been ever in any use as they don't do it!!!
Never been to any worse than this airport.",1
"This airport is outdated and run down , most of the staff are very friendly, but unfortunately the transfer bus driver to the long stay car park was the most miserable man we have ever met , not a bit friendly or helpful . Then on leaving the car park on which we had pre booked tried to charge us another £15 saying we were over time we argued it out and suddenly they found our booking, then let us through .
Overall our experience of the airport was not good and will try to avoid it in the future.",1
Remind me never to use this airport ever again big long queues at immigration on a Wednesday night no other regional I use is this bad.,1
Flight delayed Again. Waited far to long to go through security Again. Gentleman infront was elderly and no one to help him check luggage in. Just not a pleasant experience.,1
"Absolute shambles of an airport.  There is really no direction to passengers on how to navigate the ridiculous queues.  Staff stood around chatting, embarrassed at the situation.  We paid for fast track through security but no sign which the fast track queue was, clearly many people in the queue weren't eligible but airport staff waving them on.  Surely the management knew how many flights were departing but haven't made adequate provision for security to handle the volume.  I will literally never fly out of this airport again.  Really embarrassing for Yorkshire's flagship airport.",1
Absolutely disaster worst international airport I ever been parkin nightmare roads to airport total disaster not recommended!!!!,1
Absolutely disgusting facilities the toilets smelt of strong urine they're hard things on the wall to stop the smells but was absolutely full of dust so that wouldn't work and just in general it was really tired and run down lack of investment.,1
"After our plane landed, we were kept waiting on the plane for 42 minutes supposedly waiting for the airport buses. The airport is too small & can not cope if a few planes land in quick succession. This same thing happened to me before the Covid outbreak. I will not be flying in or out of this rubbish airport again.",1
"This airport is a joke. Ridiculously narrow access roads and no signposting to (what I assume are) better roads. £55 to park for 5 days. £5 simply to drop someone off. Being told to turn up 3 hours before the flight then bring told security queue is 5 minutes on arrival. Pointless ""fast track"" security, which is actually just another line that maybe saved me 5 minutes. Aggressive charity workers accosting passengers at the narrowest part of the terminal. Cramped, unpleasant terminal with minimal seating, awful low ceilings and no air-conditioning. Total exploitation of the consumer's lack of choice in order to extract as much money as possible.",1
As per normal 1.30 hour to get past security. Still the only clean part of this terrible airport are the shops.,1
"Well, where do I start, when I first flew from this airport about 30 years ago I was not impressed.
I'm not sure if the airport has had any face lifts since.
The whole process of getting to and from the plane is very painful.
Not enough seating area for an airport of this size so people are always sat on the floor or standing in the corridors blocking them etc.
:O(",1
Almost missed our flight due to security delays despite arriving 2 hours early. Short staffed after 179 were laid off during the pandemic and now they are struggling to recruit anyone. This was a management decision by someone and they shouldn't still be in their job. It has now been voted the worst airport in the UK with good reason. The whole place looks run down and it's a miserable experience being treated like cattle from beginning to end.,1
"Long stay car park review - If I could give zero stars I would have!

Avoid at all costs, during the evening (may be the same during the day) they only have 1 bus on which takes about 30-45 minutes to do a round trip. We were late checking in but hoped it was a one off and then we returned at 3am in the morning it was another 35 minute wait for the bus - I ended up walking down the main road to the car park with 3 tired children.

Do yourself a favour and pay a little bit extra for Viking or an offsite long stay.",1
"How old are these posts? This airport is a disgrace and run by rude and untrained personnel. The CEO should be ashamed of himself and this airport, the facilities are a disgrace. This company is an embarrassment to Yorkshire folk when overseas visitors arrive.",1
"I Dropped my partner off and was in carpark 2 minutes max and was expected to pay £5, on having no payment card's on me to pay they refused to open gate to let me out. The guy on the speaker was rude and arrogant and told me all airports charge for drop off. I told him your wrong as Doncaster before closing gave 15 minutes free for drop off or pick up but he told me I was wrong and if I wanted to get out the carpark I had to go and see his boss In the airport. After parking car up and speaking to her they let me out. This is wrong and an extortionate way of making money from people and I won't be pulling in the drop of area again.",1
"Good points about Leeds Bradford Airport
Clean, quick and easy check in with Jet2
Bad point, absolute disgrace long stay onsite parking, £87 FOR 7 DAYS!! (April 2023)
TOTAL RIP-OFF. THIS AMOUNT CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED
I will take this into account when booking future holidays deciding which airport to fly from

Absolute chaos through security, loads of staff but most just standing about doing nothing! Delays here are caused by poor staff only
Leeds Bradford Airport now down to 1 star",1
"Two and a half hours in security queue is pathetic.
Only three of the still insufficient four security lanes open at peak 7 am flight time. Two lanes were for “fast track” and people whose flight was about to leave, presumably as they had been in the third line. Insufficient staff to properly manage the three open lanes.
They are also happy to sell you lounge access at £40 pp knowing that you will have 10 minutes there if you are lucky.
Upon return things were as bad very long wait for luggage and then a massive queue to get through one of the two nothing to declare security scanners.
Even though I have an LS postcode I will be going back to flying from Newcastle in future as they have the infrastructure proportionate to the passenger numbers.
I’m sorry LBA but no more Alan Bennett class for me!",1
If you like delays and standing in queues for long periods of time this is the airport for you. Appalling.,1
"The worst airport I've experienced. The drop off issues are bad enough, but then you're through security to a cramped area with what feels like no air conditioning (even on an average day) and a full lounge with families trying to escape the heat.

Don't use this place for business flights, go anywhere else, unless you just want to get trollied before your flight.",1
"The worse airport that we traveled from! To avoid this airport.
They diden't let us through at security chech  steril wather for infant, to use for baby formula.
This is unexeptable.
We travel a lot from UK with our kids, and never ever had this problem.
After we haded to the gates direction, all the doors was closed, nobody around to help the passergers where to head to get to gates. After a couple of minutes somene arrived and send everyone back to security, and open another door to go to gates.
ITS A TOTAL CHAOS AT THIS AIRPORT, AVOID IT",1
Been waiting 24h for a flight to Bucharest and still didn’t left the airport 🤦🏻‍♀️ the staff are completely useless. All they can say it’s “I don’t know “ and “we are not sure”. We been waiting at the gate twice and asked to get back in the airport because the airplane it’s not safe for fly. No information about the flight. Last night we were told that the flight it’s delayed until morning because of the weather but today everything is back to normal but only this flight has a problem. Very disappointed,1
"I'm a 15 year old child and I got frisked and patted down, I repeatedly told them many times I didn't want to be, whilst hyperventilating, as I hate when people touch me. My mum told them about my severe anxiety and undiagnosed autism, however, they wouldn't listen and went ahead with the frisking and patting down. As suspected, they found nothing. They told me that they had no reason to do it, that it was just a routine check, so why choose the child to frisk and the one who was very clearly hyperventilating and not at all comfortable. Choose the person after me if it's routine. This felt like a violation of my rights and honestly like assault",1
An embarrassment to Yorkshire. Extortionate pick up and drop off fees and whenever I've had to go through Passport control on arrival the queues are massive and you're made to wait for extensive periods with no communication - as if they don't anticipate any actual planes bringing people to the airport????  Shops inside the airport are rubbish as well and don't showcase anything about Yorkshire. Management need to take a good look at themselves at how it's run.,1
"The worst stuff assistant short stay car park and free car park.
Always there an issues with tickets machine .",1
"Ridiculous Qué and wait to get out of airport and passport control.
Needs to be resolved as not the first time.
Airport is too crammed, not enough seats or facilities and far too hot.",1
"Carparks badly organised and poorly signed. Complete disregard of COVID mitigations throughout departure and arrivals. Customers packed together with poor ventilation in long winding indoor queues. Security is a complete joke with customers queuing over an hour. Baggage on return was slow, cramped and also badly ventilated. Some simple mitigations such as opening doors for better ventilation could drastically reduce virus spread and probably save some lives. Update: Although covid regulations have now ceased LBA remains a dive. Got back today to wait 30 minutes in the plane for a bus then 30 minutes to get to luggage reclaim to discover our bags on a different carousel to the one on the info boards.",1
"Zero feasible transport connection options. Every reasonable option is either not possible or extortionate. No rail connection at all, no bus option unless you're going into the city centre. Parking is ridiculously expensive. Only permitted taxis are over double the cost of an uber. Normal taxis aren't allowed to pick up. And if you get a lift from family or friend, its a £5 charge too. Better to go to Manchester and get straight on a train.",1
"Jet2 Flight landed bang on time at 18.25 then had to wait 30 mins on aircraft waiting for buses. Then a further 1 hour 20 mins queue to get through immigration with no access to toilets.
This seems a regular occurrence at LBA. Most other airports take around 20 minutes to get through on arrival. Desperately needs investment, a very poor experience.",1
"am very outraged by what happened at Leeds Airport today. Our plane's departure was delayed twice. In the end, two hours later, when the exit number and departure time were indicated, we headed to our gate. However, we had to stand in a huge queue waiting in a narrow, dirty corridor without the ability to overtake the people standing in front, who, as it turned out, were flying on another flight !!!!!

As a result, we arrived at the exit exactly at 9:15, as indicated on the airport schedule along with a group of other passengers, but the exit was closed!!! The airport staff agreed that it was their mistake, but we were not allowed on board the plane!!!!!!!!!! As a result, we were left at the airport without the opportunity to fly to Warsaw today!!! What I should do now???? Who will pay for another flight???",1
"The worst airport ever and feel disappointed to write this as it is our only local airport. We were supposed to be travelling today for our Europe trip but rather sitting here writing this. You may have guessed it by now that we missed our flight along with 50 other passengers in the same flight. Despite boarding tickets were issued to all who were left behind, sit there in a never ending queue to get security checked and finally when it happened the gate door were closed and the flight was gone.

Here are few tips for future travellers;
- Expect worst possible customer service from Airport Staff
- Never fly from this airport as you will loose your money and precious time.
- Do not fly with Ryanair even if you find a £1 flight.
- Prefer to travel from Manchester if possible, it may look like you are spending more time to get there but it will be worth than coming and flying from here.

We are devastated and its hard to see the disappointment and tears in kids eyes for what we experienced here today. They were counting the days on their finger tips for past 2 weeks for their holiday.  This airport should be shut, FULL STOP.",1
I have never been to a filthier airport in my life. The place looks like a trash bin!,1
"Pleasantly surprised with the outward leg 2 weeks ago, but the return yesterday was horrendous. At least 3 planes landed within 5 minutes of each other. We were held on the plane for 15 minutes, waiting for buses to take us to the terminal. When we got in the terminal a massive queue for passport control. Give them their due, they were very efficient and cheerful and got the hundreds of people through very quickly. It went rapidly down hill after that - baggage collection, which has never been that good an experience, was like a rugby scrum. Hundreds of people waiting for their cases in a really small room. The carousel was whizzing round at quite a fast rate with cases packed together making it difficult to remove your case, that's when you could fight your way to the front. When you had got your cases you then had to fight your way through the crowds to get out. This really has to be sorted out, it's ridiculous. After enduring that ordeal, off to get a taxi. Arrow Cars have the monopoly, other companies aren't allowed to wait for customers, if you want another company you have to ring and wait in the cold and wet for a taxi to arrive. Anyway, went to the Arrow Cars window and was told there was a 2 hour wait. What?? Told them not to bother, managed to log on to WiFi and booked an Uber which arrived in less than 10 minutes. This airport really needs to get it's act together. Were not even going to have the alternative of Doncaster airport soon when that closes. Levelling up? Hah!",1
"Antiquated dump.
Grubby, in need of serious investment, too small now, and generally just the worst airport in Europe",1
"Lba is the worst airport in the world, what a dump, extortionate drop off costs, dirty cafe's, inadequate staffing at security, can easily que for an hour, rude border control staff, baggage collection took over an hour and no staff to talk to, we were told belt 2 and two other flights came and went before ours arrived even though we landed before them, worst part of a holiday!",1
"What a disaster. Queueing outside the airport building for security (2hrs in total). ANPR not working on car park entry, filthy, cramped seating, disgusting toilets, rip off food, carousel breaks repeatedly, staff who coudn't care less, one airport bus covering the on-site parking.

Only good thing is Jet2 staff who are excellent.

Each time I use this place it makes me feel ashamed, what must foreign visitors think when they land here? The contrast with airports abroad is marked. There the people working on the apron are in clean clothes, have modern equipment and appear happy, the buses are not overcrowded and cases arrive in minutes, the terminals are immaculate and stylish and efficient.",1
Terrible. Worst airport ever experienced. Took nearly 2 hrs to get from the plane to passport control. Young children forced to stand firstly for 1 hour on the tarmac in the blazing son. Then 50 mins in a glass corridor with no ventilation in inhumane conditions. Wall to wall with people. Security cues enormous stretching full length of the airport. Avoid this airport.  No staff about. No one cares.,1
Dark and dingy with narrow walkways and low ceilings. Feels very cramped and you are forced through a busy shop just to get to the gates. Unfriendly staff.  Must be a contender for the worst airport in the country.,1
"It seems that the latest delays and disruptions hit this airport badly because the sight I've witnessed today was very dissapointing and frankly worrying. From lack of organisation, poor floor design (with two separate queues merging into chaos between the one waiting to check in and other to the luggage drop off) to overflowing rubbish bins and apallingly dirty toilets.  I understand the difficulties that the airports are facing but queues blocking the escape doors and drinks spilled on the floor are serious safety hazards.  To add to the mix,  my 16 year old brother's flights has been delayed almost 2 hours now and there has been no information on the board or staff to reassure passengers that they'll be able to board safely any time soon.  He's been now on the plane for an extra hour,  waiting for the luggage to be delivered to the plane.  I'm worried,  dissapointed and disgusted at the same time. 😔😑 Filth,  lack of care and very low standards.  In the meantime,  way better Doncaster Sheffield is fighting to stay afloat. What a shame!!!!",1
"After flying onto LBA from a smaller airport in France I was disappointed with the litter and cleanliness of the arrival area leading to the baggage reclaim belt, if this is what we are showcasing to the passengers arriving in Leeds it is very shameful.",1
"I’m very disappointed Fast track. I bought one especially for myself and my children to avoid waiting in lines, but unfortunately there were none Fast track waste of money !!!!!!",1
"Would put 0 star if it was available….flew from LBA in July and had booked Viking Car Park as had used it before with it using a minibus service to the main terminal which accommodated the needs of my disabled brother, however on this occasion with only about 24 hours notice I was “ upgraded “ to the long stay car park which was a fair further distance away and offered no minibus shuttle service which caused a lot of discomfort to my brother. Even though a valid blue disabled badge was displayed I returned to find a penalty notice on my car and the company who issued the ticket on behalf of LBA airport trying to extort money!! Disgusting all round experience and would advise anyone/everyone to choose any other airport than this one!!",1
"Shameful airport. Dirty ,mouldy, poor ventilation,queues.Avoid if you can. Flights get delayed, short staffing. Rip  off for parking. 6£ for drop off. Poor shops, extremely overpriced, London airports are cheaper. Terrible.",1
"I fly from this airport around 4-5 times a year. It has got progressively and noticeably worse in recent times.  Grossly understaffed and the waiting areas are filthy, food lying on the floor, empty containers scattered everywhere etc. The wait times are too long for how busy it is, getting through security is an absolute nightmare when it's not even busy, it's chaos.  The whole place seems entirely mismanaged and outdated. It's shocking.",1
"What a shambolic mess this place is.
These  so called managers etc have had all summer to resolve their issues with security, baggage claim, which is truly an absolute nightmare and things still remain the same !
Virtually every other airport have improved their game, APART from Leeds!
Shockingly shabby, diabolical disorganisation and super stressed passengers.
With a 2 hour wait for security when flying out,  and when you return absolute incompetence in baggage claim why oh why do Jet2 not step in and insist on some professionalism and get the job done !
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FLYING FROM THIS SHAMBOLIC AIRPORT unless you absolutely absolutely must.",1
"This country is so run down its scary. Having seen other Airports in Spain Italy and many other countries they put our Airports to shame they look like new and run so efficient. Having to wait in a long Q for 1hour and 30-mins only to be told the luggage belt had broken down and nobody to fix it ( no surprise there then, this is England remember) Everyone had to carry and take their case to the other side of the airport to have it put onto the aircraft...lol. This beyond a joke. All our airports are so run down and so scruffy everything is worn out and falling apart. I used this airport toilets and 2-urinals had been covered over with plastic bags and out of order with a notice say waiting for repair. the escalator was also not working. This is another case of broken England. When I eventually arrived in Spain the airport was like new and everything was clean and worked perfectly and we were amazed how efficient it was. All our airports are dirty scruffy, run down, disgusting places with the worst services compared to other countries that are showing us up.
Leeds and Bradford Airport is the (worst of them all) its disgusting and scruffy, rundown place indeed.",1
"Awful.. First time we have flown from there after making 10 flights from Manchester in the last 10 months. Absolute chaos...
No order. People checking in bags and those not checking in bags queuing for an hour in the same queue. Chaos at the gate. Chaos getting on the plane.
Stay clear..",1
"Absolutely diabolical ...We queued  through the whole airport to get to security, after dropping off our luggage so easily. By the time we finally got through security we had to go to board the plane. Not even able to sit down and have a drink. Would never use this airport ever again",1
Horrible long delays at security with fast track holding everything up.  I travel weekly and this is the worst airport I have ever come across in Europe. Also crowded gates and poor eateries.,1
Disgrace management. Whoever is calculating how many aircrafts can be departed and landed with available staff on ground needs sacking and sending back to school for some more maths lessons. Hours delays on every flight due to lack of staff says it all,1
"Drop off charges are absolutely disgusting,  especially in the current climate. I was in the carpark for THREE MINUTES and was charged £6. Sick.",1
The grottiest airport in the country unfortunately it’s my closet. How they can charge what they charge to park there and still be as bad inside is beyond me. I can only assume the money goes on (mis) management it’s certainly doesn’t go into the infrastructure. It’s beyond repair and needs pulling down !!,1
"This airport is not for those who travel with little kids. Everywhere stairs and no lifts, they don’t give pushchairs so I had to carry my toddler all way down till the baggage pickup area, I also had to stay in the same queue in Passport Check.",1
"Badly organised. Ridiculous length of time spend at airport. Why did we need to be there for three hours?  Flight delayed. One hour flight time - 7 hours at airport. And we weren't the worst off. Flights cancelled and no one there to deal with customers.  And the £5 charge just to drop someone off? You do start to feel like it's all a plan to keep you there and over charge you for everything.  Used to love flying from LBA.
The star is for the assistance staff who were lovely with my dad. Thank you.",1
"Horrible experience, low ceilings and people packed to the brim, this gave almost a sense of claustrophobia. Had to wait 8h for a layover, half of that time we wandered around the airport in circles looking for an empty seat, there were none, only in the evening people started to disperse and it was possible to sit down on a seat instead of the floor.",1
"Long qs. Over 45 mins and still not through passport control, pathetic really for one plane load. Won't use again
Disorganised and clueless",1
"If I could give zero I would. Absolutely appalling , so poorly run, no organisation, not a staff member in sight. The shuttle bus saw us and drove off (I had a baby with me) could see I was seconds away.  2 hours it had taken to get through the tiniest security bit. I had a baby and stood waiting 30 minutes just for them to check my sterilised water for the formula, despite ringing up and checking it was okay, they said they would ‘let me off this time’. Which it states on there website I am allowed it as well. We was then late to the gate as it was boarding  despite being there 3 hours early. as it had to taken so long as they was having a good laugh at the security talking to each other while I still stood with a baby waiting for them to give me my bag back. Coming back home was just as bag, no shuttle bus put on for everyone who had to walk from otherside of the run way at 4am in morning , elderly people struggling to walk so far. Two women stood who work there giggling as they could see tired and struggle people.Getting your luggage off the broken carousels where your crammed like cattle and can’t move. Again no staff to be seen. Then the shuttle bus that states it would be there every 10mins decided to  showed up 30 minutes instead. Never again Manchester or east middles airport from now on",1
"Having one check in desk for an entire flight is simply not enough! There was a huge queue and although the man who checked in was very helpful in sorting out our requirements, the airport management is sadly lacking. Desperately in need of a thorough overhaul, in terms of service.",1
"Filthy, dilapidated and extortionate.

It is obvious that airport management have long abandoned the idea of providing a service to passengers and instead turned to blatant profiteering, through eye watering parking charges or designing the current layout to resemble a glorified duty free shop with a few planes parked outside it.

The airport is filthy, hardly any bins but plenty of mess. I assume the cleaners were made redundant, along with security and ground staff, and they haven’t been replaced. The toilets in particular are disgusting.

I have travelled to and from this airport for thirty odd years and it’s current incarnation is by far the worst. I can’t think of any redeeming quality of this airport with the notable exception being getting to leave the wretched place.

For a purported international gateway to Yorkshire, this is simply a local and national embarrassment.

There are third world countries with far better airports.

Zero stars wasn’t an option, but it is about as many stars as this place deserves.",1
"Having collected my friend from here stopping in the ""free for an hour"" parking area. Ended up staying over by approximately 12 minutes.. being charged £49 for the privilege was a bit of a suprise! No apparent warning signs of this possibility. Disgraceful tbh. Won't be collecting or going anywhere near this airport again. Not the mention the depressing drive thru Leeds and totally unsuitable road network around it with heavy queuing everywhere.",1
Total rip off. Collected my son and his family the flight was delayed to France air traffic control and then he was a hour getting through customs and the pick up point charged £28 I have flown from this air port before but never again.,1
"Like it wasn't enough disruption due to closing Doncaster Airport, staff from Leeds Bradford Airport found it very rude,impolite,no patience at all to customer and especially with people with disabilities.  It was the worst experience in the last 7 years which i had it. Use to fly from different airports and everything was better than this one. I thinking to avoid this airport in the future.",1
"Worst airport I've every used. First I get scammed by Ryan Air then. Get lost 3 times as signs are all there but in the wrong place. Then there is a system at security that can be only described as ""bonkers"" pint £8 in a plastic cup because the dishwasher is broken. and staff with the brains of a bag of washing. I have zero confidence that my bags will be s",1
"Overcrowded, claustrophobic, and absolutely no seating outside the overpriced bars and cafes in departures. It is just too busy for its size. Not to mention the quarter of a mile walk from the gate to the plane through a glorified bus shelter. The whole place needs bulldozing and starting again. Avoid if at all possible. Not a pleasant start to a holiday.",1
Machines for self check in don’t understand pooled baggage. Outsized baggage is in a . cupboard in a cul de sac where you are told to wait for someone to come with no means of alerting someone you are actually there.,1
"Entire airport dirty, couldn't find a clean seat in any of the waiting areas or the restaurants, air con didn't work, I don't even want to remember the state of the toilets... Each time I visit it's worse! if you can fly from anywhere else please do. Leeds Bradford airport is miles behind what Doncaster Sheffield airport used to be.",1
"Horror stories became reality. Friday morning, 9 flights going out between 0600  - 0630. Jet 2 check was slick and quick, airport security was a laughing stock and dangerous. 9 flights averaging 220 people each flight, around 2000 passengers lined up waiting to get through security in time for their flights and all funnelled down to pass through one single archway metal detector and the staff not knowing what to do! Within two hours poor passengers were lined up outside, down the road and out of the car park stood in the rain. CEO, you need to step down! This is unacceptable and a security risk to the point of being dangerous. You’ve had over 6 months to prepare for summer.",1
"Officially now the worst Airport in the UK due to the ineptness of management who try and blame the lack of staff for the shambles and  queues But it is they who did not plan for the ease of travel and bring staff back early . Its no use blaming the pandemic  as it was just the same before.
Discusting toilets  lack of seating   and as for arrivals baggage hall is dirty and out of date  an a escalator that's not worked for 10 year  making a climb of stairs difficult for older People
But fair play to Jet 2 staff they seem to run the airport 5 stars to them  .The Twilight check in is great  The the Airport recucllently providing a free drop area which gets less and less and is made as difficult as possible to push a case over the potholes and rought ground",1
"Staff rude and miserable, aggressively bark orders at people, no manners and not a single word from miserable passport guy. Such a different experience from Palma airport.",1
Dreadful. As normal. Going out Massive queues for security. Then long walk to plane. Arrived back at 11 p.m. again no transport long walk to terminal outside including several sets of stairs. Then normal long wait at passport control. All topped off with ripoff taxi fares where the driver had no security clearance. Couldn't pick us up at the stand. We had to walk to car park.,1
"Overcrowded  more than usual
This airport is NOT fit for purpose
It should be put out ro grass",1
"Zero stars for this airport! Due to an airport staff mistake our flight departured with more than an hour delay. They were not able to state even the gate number on the departure screens, I had to check myself each gate to find out which is the correct one. Terrible services and experience.",1
"Customer service is absolutely not existing:
- No desk to declare lost luggage
- Declaration form done myself, delivered to check in desk but never registered. I did the declaration another time on the phone with AirfranceKLM.
- No news from luggage “lost” after 3 days. Luggage arrived same day but is waiting that someone (Swissport) take care of it at the airport.
- When you call the number on the website, the line is busy…maybe by all other guys like me waiting for their luggage!
Next time I will try Manchester Airport. They can only be more professional.",1
"There is NOTHING I like about this airport. It is an embarrassment to Leeds to have it's name and a shameful business in the way it runs.

Bad points? Well it's all bad. I have nothing good to say.

Money grabbing in every respect and more than any other airport, particularly with parking. Parking is really hard to negotiate and offensively expensive. It is actually difficult to work out how to drop off someone therefore most people walk or get the bus if they live locally.

Rude and ineffective security staff at border control. Multiple experiences of this.

Too small for the traffic.

Has had building work for the last 25 years I've been using it.

Hot, stuffy, cramped, claustrophobic. Always crowded. Not enough seats or facilities. Dirty.

Dated, antiquated, embarrassingly unfinished appearance.

I nearly always  drive to Manchester or beyond and I live 10 minutes drive for Leeds Airport.",1
"Absolutely terrible airport!.Dirty, chaotic, very bad air conditioning. Our flight got delayed and we sat down to have beer upstairs. The tables were dirty, full of rubbish. The same with the toilet area. Absolutely disgusting. This is the first and the last time I flew through this airport!!!",1
"Airport is not passengers friendly if you need to wait long. No facilities, cold.
Also no-one to speak if you have problem.
They also charge £5 for drop-off & pick-up... shocking",1
"Flew from Leeds Bradford Airport on Thursday to Tenerife. My wife and I were booked into the VIP lounge, this was our third time, we were not disappointed. It's just a great way to start your holiday. It's very clean and has  everything you require, good food, a great selection, and it's well furnished with all sorts of drinks, alcohol and non alcohol. We had a young lady, named Rachel looking after us, she was just wonderful. She catered are every need. Rachel certainly gave us a 5 Star start to our holiday, take a bow young lady.",1
Horrible little airport with minimal facilities and aging infrastructure. Low ceilings makes everything seem like a hallway rather than an airport terminal. Manchester is a far better option despite their issues.,1
"Horrible airport. The road access is horrendous. The airport is small, dirty and outdated. Nothing seems to be improving. The cost of short stay parking is extortionate! Avoid at all cost",1
Being held on the plane for over an hour after landing to wait for a bus to take us less than 300m is ridiculous and not acceptable 🤬🤬🤬🤬,1
"Ridiculous lack of management!! Idiots redundant 180 people and now they are short as hell. Missed my flight today (not just me), was waiting two and half hour in queue. Couldn't hear anything because speakers system was to quite and it was to many people waiting in queue. Total chaos, Jet2 stuff were cutting in to the fast track queue their customers. I did complain and asked manager is it fine and answer was Yes!? So don't wait just cut in to the line.",1
"What a shambles! Arrived on flight on Good Friday night from Dublin. Waited over 1 hr for luggage to be unloaded! No explanation or apology.  Then return flight  to Dublin from Leeds Bradford on Easter Sunday. I am disabled and advised to arrive early. Also large red notice on website advising to arrive early because of possible delays.  Despite this check in was not open until 2 hrs before flight so spent 3 hrs in reception area! Aer Lingus check in then was 10 mins late opening. We were first in queue but due to staff inability to operate system, or to know how to deal with special assistance,  I spent over 1 hr at check in . This resulted in Special assistance people saying we had 8 mins before getting to gate. No time to get meal. Special assistance managed to get us a sandwich and drink to eat on plane. On arrival at gate Check in staff had not completed necessary paperwork for my mobility scooter and we were further delayed!  Not a good experience of this airport.  Only positive was the SPECIAL ASSISTANCE TEAM who were fantastic.  They were polite, helpful and professional   and tried to make a very difficult experience slightly better .",1
"This is the Airport from ""HELL"" avoid this place like the plague. Human beings should not be treat like this in the 21st century! There are scarcely any members of staff to approach for information and the ones you are lucky enough to, see all have expression of doom & gloom. Not surprised really, I would if I worked in this sewer. The queues are ridiculously long, the toilets are appalling, the baggage handlers! I can only imagine there is one person doing the job because you wait an eternity for your luggage, the list is endless. I would not trust the management at this airport to run a jumble sale. I will never, ever fly from this dump ever again.",1
Arrived on flight number FR 6438 on Saturday afternoon and disembarked at gate 12. There were no buses to take us to arrivals so had to walk to security with my hand luggage. I am 81 years of age and found it a struggle as there was 3 flights of stairs to climb and a long walk to passport control.After security the escalator to go down to customs was out of order so more steps down with my luggage. What a third rated airport this is getting to be.,1
"Leeds Bradford Airport is an operational nightmare. The only good thing about this airport was the check-in desk, ran by Jet2.

This airport makes thousands of passengers queue for hours on end and offer no apology for it.

Despite having “Fast Track” passes, we queued for over 2 hours for security. Passengers who arrived late were rushed through the (very narrow) Fast Track queue so they didn’t miss their flight.  Staff didn’t even acknowledge the long wait.

Arrivals was a similar situation where we were made to queue again in a corridor (so a different flight could board) before we could enter the arrival security.

Don’t use Leeds Bradford Airport unless you absolutely have to, and if you do, make sure you allow plenty of extra time.",1
They charge £6.00 for you to simply drop people off. That's utterly disgusting...RIP Off of the highest order...Will never use this airport again.  I,1
There to collect someone . Plane landed then they waited on Jet2 plane as not enough buses and not allowed to walk 30 yards (but Ryan air can) lol . Couldn’t make it up . 1 hour from landing to actual collection,1
"Waited almost two hours for suitcases to come after a flight from Amsterdam when we were the only flight coming in. Not only that, but we had to wait for an absurd amount of time to even leave the plane after we had been told to take off our seatbelts. No updates from anyone other than the hostesses on our flight (who have nothing to do with the airport), no error message on the board, just randomly the carousel started. The airport itself is poorly organized, cramped, and only has about 10 seats total for people waiting at the carousel - people started sitting on the floor. I heard it was due to understaffing - how do you expect an airport to run smoothly or efficiently with waiting times that long?Absolutely ridiculous. Hire more staff or treat your current staff better so that they have a reason to care about their job. Made me excruciatingly late for important engagements (the whole reason why I chose to take an early flight to Leeds Bradford instead of Manchester) and I am now realizing it has taken longer. Just go to Manchester and take the cheap two hour train only a 5 minute walk from the terminal. On another note - LBA is incredibly poorly connected to the rest of Leeds/Bradford/all of Yorkshire - buses take too long to get to destinations that are about 6 minutes away by car, and they come far too infrequently, even the ones to Leeds - a major train station which you’d imagine a lot of people are trying to get to in order to access the rest of the region. The buses are also expensive. And what kind of airport requires you to take a bus to go rent a car? Shameful. Needs to be completely revamped and modernized. Or bulldozed to the ground.",1
"Horrible place, I was forced to sleep on the floor , as the staff on the airport says it’s not their business that the Ryanair don’t have anyone there at the desk…. The other time I did pay for fast track line but the queue was across while airport and the fast track line had only 1,5 marks so everyone was joking the line … waste of money and time",1
"Time travel back to 70’s!
No staff ,dirty outdated building, massive queues to passport control when it’s off season …Torture for an adult ,for elderly or kids even worse.Avoid!
(In fact avoid all UK airports if you can .They are the worst in the world .",1
They dont give service but take your money..for example fast track..,1
"What a shambles this airport has become. It’s always been dirty and unfit for purpose but now the lack of staff makes it an awful experience.
Having to queue 3 hours for security meant a 3am rise for a 7am flight that didn’t leave on time.
Our return flight was delayed for the same reason and the queues to get through security were lengthy with no welfare provisions.
Poor customer service.",1
"Leeds Bradford really is just a Fisher Price airport isn’t it. It has a few planes that actually take off on occasion and a duty free, but apart from that it better resembles an old derelict landing strip at the end of nowhere.

Security line is chaotic, no logic to the queue or lanes, members of staff are constantly shouting, I was physically pushed in different directions twice by various colleagues, there’s nowhere to sit in the departure lounges, no announcements or tannoy system in the entire airport to let you know when the gate is opening, the surly staff who check your pass don’t even look up from the desk, no greeting or smile… just a total shambles and you’d be better going to any other airport.",1
"We were advised to get to the airport 3 hours before departure because of the queue's All I can say is the cleaning of anywhere was none diabolical. Everywhere was rubbish, tables not cleaned, food staying under the hot plate. I have never seen such a mess in one place. Oh the queue’s no where to be seen walked straight through.",1
"Worse Airport in UK.
Short staff make almost every flight late.
Shame on you not having enough Staff. Sitting in plane 45 min now boarding complete but no luggage loaded. Because No staff.
What ever they say lie lieand just lie
Very bad experience

Please recruit more people.",1
Everyone understands things are challenging g at the moment but it’s really patronising to not have an up to date departures board. I don’t mind if my flight is delayed a little bit tell me that as opposed to making everyone queue in a frenzy. You’ve done this for more than 20 flights already today!,1
"They kept us waiting 50 minutes for luggage, which ended up on the other belt with no info or anything. We paid extra for short stay parking despite having arranged for someone to pick us up 40 minutes after landing - and the plane landing 20 minutes early. Dirty and not very well managed.",1
"Terrible, miserable, scruffy, smelly, congested, inefficient and understaffed. Not really sure how they manage to get it so wrong. Outbound through LBA took 2h 45 mins; even with special treatment for our whole flight we only just got to the gate in time to board. The same process at Reus took 15 minutes tops on return. Not that it would really have mattered if we'd got through more quickly, the place was so busy that there was nowhere to sit. Staff absolutely overwhelmed but it's hard to see how they could have done more given the limited space available. Choose LBA if crowds, madly overpriced parking, stress and queuing in the rain at 2:45 AM are your thing. Otherwise go elsewhere",1
"Out bound security checks were a joke. There was only one out of four security checking stations open. It was plain to see there was not enough trained staff and the existing staff were stretched to breaking. I can't believe they could not link their staffing requirements to known passengers which have booked flights or is it just another example of lack of planning and short-termism which this country seems to be doing on a regular basis.
Jet2 well done with your efficient and smooth check in service, yet again, ashame you can't  run the security check-in, things might better.",1
"First of all, Jet 2 staff are all lovely and helpful and making the best of a very very dire situation. Flew in from paphos today. Queue for your passport control. Queue for baggage claim. No bags on baggage claim. Queue for toilet. No toilet roll. Came out of toilet , member of staff sitting with her feet up on a giant stack of toilet roll saying she’s just gonna go home. Queue for nothing to declare. Customs gates broken. People stuck in gates. arrivals hall absolutely rammed and everyone is manic for the morning flights back out. Fighting against crowd just to get out again. Jet 2 staff trying to explain to people where to go but everyone is up a height. Queue for taxi. Car park exit gates broken. Couldn’t make it up. From getting picked up from our hotel in paphos to turning the key in our front door took 12 hours.",1
Staff at security were excellent.  Apart from that I have never seen a dirtier airport.  The toilets the floors disgusting.,1
"The airport it's self is rather filthy and run down not a nice sight to fly into, and the staff are extremely rude and pushy, very unhelpful to passengers that may need advice or help, and signs not correctly displayed, such as the no phone rule 'after' passport check! I was very rudely shouted at on my way out of security check whilst taking an important phone call yet I was already past security and through the airport, the rude member of staff continously shouted whilst I was taking the phone call and then proceed to insult me in the process! And I won't even get started on the prices of the terrible food there... 😒",1
"Ignoring the long security queues that are plaguing airports, Leeds Bradford has it's own issues. It's a small airport that quickly becomes overcrowded with the amount of flights that are bunched together. Lack of air conditioning (it's installed, just turned off) despite record breaking heat waves in the UK. The whole place also has a grubby, dirty feel to it the likes you may find at a local bus station. To top it off incorrect and late gate information with lack of seating.
If you can avoid flying from here, I'd recommend you do so.",1
"Check in 5* with Ryan air and plane took off bang on time however we had to wait on Monday 6/9/21 over 1.5 hours to get through security which was disgusting . Yes , those that had paid fast track security were through a little quicker however still had to queue. This airport needs to get its act together particularly when 3 flights are scheduled to leave around 7am at the same time , this has happened to us pre and post pandemic and yes I should have known better , purchase fast track but really why should you have to . Only 2 of the 4 scan areas were covered by staff , I felt really sorry for all the security staff who were polite , friendly and working extremely hard to pass folk through . Once through security we had less than 25 mins to get to our gate hence a policeman opened a back security door to pass us through .  Chaos,  please get your act together Leeds & Bradford . If all 4 scan areas covered would have been half the time wait which is a bit more acceptable .",1
"Quite possibly the worst airport I have ever set foot in. Granted, no issues with flights but absolutely no seating for the whole of our pre-departure wait. I don’t think I’ve ever seen toilets quite as dirty as I did in Leeds Bradford and the food/beverage choice was equally as awful whilst also being equally as unsanitary. It was small, way to busy for its size and god knows what diseases I left with.
Never again.",1
"It's a great little airport for domestic flights, my main criticism is the obvious lack of staff in the security area. You have 4 scan areas and even when it's peak times and massively busy there is only 2 of them manned with the queue often stretching back into the check-in area through the long corridors. ""You can pay for the fasttrack lane"" - why should people have to PAY to avoid being held in security for over an hour? This isn't Bangkok or Dubai. I would give you 4/5 but until this is sorted you're getting 1/5.",1
Awful long queues to get through security on way out causing a departure delay. We were there wirhin three hours of check in and queued for over 2.5 hours without even making it to the security area until our flight was called through. Delayed flight returning home due to the same reason back in Leeds. Baggage took over 30 minutes to come onto the belt on arrival home.  Not a good experience at all especially with a young child in tow.,1
"By far one of the worst travel experiences ever. Massive queues, no places where to sit, flight was also delayed and then once you pass the boarding gate and board the shuttle bus- another delay, it has been 30 minutes on the shuttle bus and we are not even close to boarding the plane",1
Worst airport in North. 3 baggage carousels all working but when 3 planes arrived at once all 3 lots of baggage came through on just the one carousel. Terribly organised. When exiting departures the Jet2 check in queue was stretching across the departure exiting making it nearly impossible to get past the queue with our cases and golf bags. Absolute shambles.,1
Extremely dirty in all areas of the airport. Cleaning teams need further training and contractors contracts reviewed. Really unhygienic and unpleasant experience,1
"Low standard airport. No air conditioning when the temperature is close to 30 degrees Celsius. Airport appears to have no cleaning staff as tables chairs are left with food and drinks containers for hours. The only people cleaning are the customers who need to use the facility.

Leeds airport, low standards made simple !",1
"One of the least convenient airports to get to. Between journeying to Leeds, there is no direct motorway access to the airport, no direct rail link to the airport (or even nearby it), and one bus route that serves it from Leeds. One route, for a city, that isn't a shuttle service either. It is used as a regular bus line thus meaning everyone else uses it and that interferes with timing (thanks to that I did miss a train back from Leeds).

I would fly from anywhere else, if they weren't either less inconvenient to get to (East Midlands), awfully busy and unable to cope with demand (Manchester), or was getting mothballed because the owners can't see the potential that anyone else can, even though passenger numbers and flights were increasing year on year before Covid (Doncaster). I hate that this is the choice I'm forced to take.

EDIT: Update to my review. Flights cancelled today (13/11) owing to weather. Turns out building an airport on the top of a hill in Yorkshire, in a wet county, where there's already the chance of low cloud and mist that causes flights to be cancelled is such a brilliant idea.",1
3 flights landed at the same time and it took an hour and a half on hot tarmac and glass tunnels in 37c to get to passport control. Not enough extra measures put in place for elderly and children wavering in the queue.,1
"Cramped, poorly managed and maintained! I kid you not, we had a 1 km long queue to pass through security. You gotta arrive 4 hours earlier to not miss your flight. Even fast track doesn’t work properly here!",1
"I beg anyone reading this try an alternative airport before going from here, we went to Greece last week and the queues at jet 2 and security were the worst I have ever seen  2 hours at least and coming back yesterday was worse the bus dropped us off outside what can only be described as the runway apron the queue was that long to get through passport control. May I first say that jet 2 staff were great (still queue outside jet 2) but the airport staff were rude and unhelpful and the airport was dirty inside floors, tables, toilets (no paper, soap etc).
How can they get it so wrong, at Rhodes it took about 20 mins from getting of the plane to getting on the coach and the same coming back very little hold ups, helpful cheerful staff in abundance with a clean spotless airport.
You can't carry on LBA like this, staff training essential all over the airport and for goodness sake clean the place have you never heard of covid !!!",1
"Absolutely awful experience. Arrived early as directed, queuing fkr 2.5 hours as only 1 person was scanning boarding passess snd 2 security gate were open. Too many flights in the same time not enough personnel to manage the depargures. I ened up being late for my flight. Ryanair crew wouldn't let us in altho we were late 10 minutes after the gate clousre. At the end about 15 passengers missed their flight. No help from both Ryanair crew nor the airport personnel. Never again.",1
Travelled from LBA yesterday and could not believe the absolute filth of the airport. No air com on a very hot day. Departure gate didn't correspond with ryanair app info which resulted in a long walk to gate 9 only to be told to return to gate 6. I was travelling with a friend who has a knee injury and when we asked for assistance were told we should have precooked it and there was nothing that could be done. This was relayed in a very offhand manner. The overall experience was exhausting and the absolute filth of the airport was appaling,1
I wish I could give zero stars. Last Friday I was meant to fly to Fuerteventura but I missed my flight while still being in the security queue for 2hrs 45 minutes. Zero customer services on the ground. No offer off water. No help for the elderly that were clearly struggling in the queue (the whole group floor was a queue). Terrible experience and drove back home in utter disbelief after my awful experience. Still no reply from airport to my email and I am still out of pocket too,1
"Worst airport ever! Inedible food. Duty free more expensive than anywhere in the high street. Shameful mismanagement of getting on an airplane! Perhaps these clowns could take a visit to some other airports to see how things are done in 2022?
Shocking!!!",1
pathetic service. waited 20mins to get off plane now been stood outside in cold for 40mins just to get inside. ridiculous people wondering around not knowing if it’s arrival or departure queue. joke!,1
"This place needs someone to organise the flow of traveling passenger’s bad organised drop off luggage, attitude of staff stinks , security need to be trained, this place needs a good clean , the state of toilets is  disgrace. Will avoid this airport in the future. Management should check Newcastle airport and get some tips ..",1
"WORST airport in the world. TOTALLY STRESSFUL airport end to end experience ever. Where do I start? Poor basic signage to the car parks. No covered pedestrian walkway from the car parks to the terminal... got soaked. Completely under resourced security. Despite not having to check in any bags: 1hr30 queuing?! Airlines calling out passengers from the queues. Omg total chaos! Security wretched, failed to notice a tube of toothpaste accidently left in luggage. Once through this chaos, no time for grabbing any sorts of refreshments before boarding... just one glance at bars/restaurants all shambolic anyway. Toilets filthy, departure gate just a shed along the runway. Seriously. I will pay double flight prices to fly from somewhere else. Never again LBA... I feel sorry for folks (and Jet2) who depend on this airport.",1
"Jet2 were great
Passport controls had taken 45mins
Eat and drink areas were aweful.
And coming back into Leeds Airport was horrendous.
Nightmare getting suitcases
Getting out was an ordeal in its self
Only postive is that Jet 2 seem to have taken the role of swisport version of airport control.
If not for jet 2 team members being in security..passport control..luggage areas..arrivals location...they managed the chaos as best they could.",1
"Flew from LBA on Monday 16th May and what a complete and utter farce. Jet2 section was well staffed and efficient but the two hours plus to get through security was a mismanaged queue of massive proportions.
Yes, they'll have all the excuses but they knew how many people would be traveling weeks before and should have had a system in place rather than let everyone work one out for themselves.
There was no one to direct anyone to where they had to go and no one keeping us informed as to whether we'd get on our plane or not. That would have gone a long way to reassure travellers and it was only because, I guess, we were in a holiday mood it didn't all ""kick-off"".
No wonder the flight was one hour late as it waited for passengers to board.
This diabolical situation needs to be resolved.",1
Queued in security for over 2 hours just narrowly no missing our flight. No organisation with staff not knowing their job roles. No words to describe how terrible it was. I would happily pay extra and travel more to ensure that I never use this airport again. Disgrace.,1
"Long stay car park very very poor. No information at bus stops as to frequency of buses, not an issue during the day, but no information to inform that during the evening the intercom needs to be used to request a shuttle bus. No information on arriving at the car park as to entry with an already booked parking. Airport itself as normal since the pandemic for most airports (Newcastle seemingly the exception) - overcrowded, and poorly managed security queues. Signage a bit of a convoluted mess, but minor.",1
"Not a patch on Newcastle, the waiting times for security are ridiculous, stretching from 80 metres outside the front of the terminal, also had to sit on the plane for 20 minutes on our return whilst waiting for coach transfer",1
"one of the worst of board passport check i’ve ever been through, one desk, one staff member and queuing for longer than the flight itself. could easily have more jet 2 members and staff assistance and a a more professional outlook onto this slow and time consuming passport check. In short don’t land here if in a rush as you get a guarantee of being late.",1
"Oh we are scrapping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to security staff. Where did you find this lot?
Completely miserable, rude, job worths. They’ll show us customers just how unhappy and pedantic they can be. Teach us a lesson for bothering to use their airport and interrupt their misery. We should stay away and make their lives easier.
One nice guy in there though. God help him.",1
When we arrived at the airport we decided to go to the Yorkshire Rose lounge and have a breakfast. The quality of food was very poor. The selection of food was very limited. I asked for a bacon and egg sandwich and told it's bacon or sausage. No eggs no tomatoes. The bacon was over cooked and dry and must have been made hours earlier. The breadcake was cheap and dry. Ordered a glass of wine and they had red or white also poor quality. It was a disappointing start to our holiday and expensive. Would not recommend it.,1
"Absolutely appalling. Queued for Security for 90 minutes on departure due to short staffing. On site taxi firm couldn't provide a taxi for 60 minutes on arrival. Not enough space on the buses after disembarking from the plane so had to wait for them to do a full trip and come back. Terminal is shabby, dated, gloomy and totally inadequate for a 21st century city airport. Terrible customer experience throughout.",1
"Rubbish as ever. Long queues, slow service, it took nearly an hour to get off the plane and out of the airport, at 1am!!! With no other arrivals! Not to mention boarder control which is the only one I came across that treats eu citizens living here like criminals. No other airport in UK ever asked me to prove where I live or work, yet here it's every single time!!!! It sure lives up to its title of the worst airport in UK.",1
"Just an awful experience: they force people to put liquids ONLY in their small plastic bags. It must be ONLY 1 bag. And if you can't seal their bag you are not allowed to take your liquids on board. I saw just lots of people's left  staff there.
So I've had mine liquids in the same bag, but it was bigger, so they forced me to repack into their bag! What is that for?! Just to make queues longer? Okay, you did your job well!",1
"Utter joke of an airport.
Parking a mess.
Security queues a disgrace. No staff and staff with faces like they are chewing a wasp. Moaning in front of passengers about how hard they are done by.
Bar staff clueless.
Return journey - path from aircraft to exit takes you in, then out, past a non existent passport control, and out.
Joke of an airport. No better than a bus terminus.",1
0 stars. The worst airport I have ever been to. come at least 3 hours prior to your flight and prepare for a slightly irritated stuff that is trying to make you feel stupid even though it is their own mess that makes people confused,1
Another fail on return today waiting 10-15 mins for FR474 to come forward onto apron no ground staff.Then felt like a cheap supermarket at passport  control 1hr wait  8 tills and only 4 open. Surely they know the numbers and a daily basis. To add insult to paying passengers two border police standing behind laughing??? Come on you know who you are??Still not up to speed yet spent 2hrs in queue for security today 😒  2 staff doing boarding  passes but 5 machines there only 3 xray operators requiring breaks every 20mins need to up the game folks,1
"Shambles of an airport, thousands queueing to get through security at 4am with no staff around to direct passengers apart from one duty manager on outward flights. On returning flight bags took 2 hours to get to carousel after landing even though the were only two flights landed, as said a shambles of an airport",1
"The place isnt bad it self , but be aware that if you have same badges on your backpack , they are going to take them for themselfs. I ve lost like 25 £ that way.",1
Yet again a complete shambles at security in the airport. 2 and a quarter hours to get through. The staff do their best and keep smiling in difficult circumstances. The fault must lie with absolutely inept management and organisation. Not much better on return. They can't seem to deal with more than one plane at a time.,1
"What an absolute shambles and a national disgrace. Dirty, smelly, badly organised over priced.  If this is what an English airport looks like.  Shame on us.  What must people think who come here from another country and have to arrive at and depart from Leeds Bradford. A sure fire way of guaranteeing they won't come back.  The airports I fly into are spotless and so  well organised in comparison. I'm hanging my head in shame that this is my local airport.
**An update to my review on getting home.  Flew out of Girona Costa brava Airport.  Wow, that place is amazing. So clean and modern.  Well staffed and organised an absolute pleasure to fly from.  8 minutes to get through security.  8 minutes.... are you listening LBA. Had to go to the loo once we landed and what a shocker it was, stunk of p**s and the door was missing. Filthy. There are third world airports that are cleaner than Leeds Bradford. Worst Airport in the UK and rightly so.  Gonna try Doncaster next time.",1
"This airport is terrible or rather service, landing after 7pm as the last flight, there was no one to put up the stairs and secure it through to customs.  Then I waited 1.5 hours for the luggage because there was nobody to move the luggage from the plane to the luggage hall.  This nightmare repeats itself every time.  Do something about it, it's embarrassing.",1
"I would avoid if possible. Yes, there are good food choices and ""duty free"" shopping. (though I have yet to see any bargains). However, waiting areas are inadequate for the numbers of people. I don't blame the retailers or food outlets but  price gouging is the phrase that comes to mind when it comes to the food prices (£4.50 for average chips?).  I don't know, but my guess is that these prices reflect the rents that the outlets have to pay to the airport. Once you are airside you are a captive market( However, No price gouging at Doncaster Sheffield airport! - but not many flights from there). Several times now, on return, I have had to wait 40 minutes to get through passport control. This is during the winter schedule operation - so goodness only knows what it is like in the Summer. The border staff do their best but there are often only 3 or 4 of them (they have 6 stations). I don't know whether the numbers are under the control of the border agency or the airport-but they are insufficient for the volumes of people that arrive in particular half hour or 45 minute periods.
Overall, it provides a poor experience. I will continue to use it because it is more convenient than going to Manchester airport - but it exploits its monopoly position.",1
"An airport completely unprepared to be an airport.

Staff cannot tell you where to go, it help you when changes happen, they seem to be completely in the dark.

No announcements are made about flights (as is bizarrely the policy for the airport), so you have to watch board for updates, of which there are few, with no seating, and uninspiringly inaccurate.

Flight was diverted to Liverpool, wasn't told by anyone what was happening, went to my gate, which sent me through to boarder control and out into baggage and arrivals.  Apparently we had to catch a coach to liverpool (2 cities away) for our flight, but no one could tell us where to find the coach. Coaches were delayed for hours, and staff could not provide any information.

The only upside to this apart is that is it clean.  But that's really it.

If you want a clean, empty airport that barely functions to while away the hours, then this place is for you.

Otherwise save yourself the hassle and take literally any other airport in the north of the UK.",1
"Arrived for a flight three hours early on a Wednesday morning. No bags to check in. The queue was outside the building stretching around it. How is this possible? If you cannot handle the amount of passengers going through your airport, be realistic and lower the amount of flights. Beyond ridiculous.",1
The worse airport I have ever been. Personal of Ryanair was very rude when we ask for issuing the bordo fue pass. There is no filter water available for the customers. The space is very little and pack of people.,1
"Sat on a plane with open doors for 1 hour now, no buses to take us 100 yds to the terminal
Complete incompetence from LBA as usual
The airport management are an absolute disgrace
An airport in the dark ages",1
"This airport has not woken up since lockdown, in fact I think the staff probably preferred it when the airport was empty.
Massive queues for check in/bag drop, massive queues for security (only one belt) and rude staff.

On return they didn’t bother to allocate anyone to collect our bags from the aircraft so we all had to stand there for an hour, no staff present. The border force had to sort it out for them by contacting the duty manager and Swiss port..this is not their job! The Swissport desk at the baggage carousels was closed, no phone. There’s a sign to say use the desk in the main check in hall, but this was also unmanned.

Wake up LBA!!",1
"Do not fly from Leeds bradford airport if you have a choice. We have flown twice in last 3 months.
1. Drop off in airport costs £5.
2. Queues for check in 2 hours plus. They have the cheek to offer a fast track for £5?. Of course that means non fast trackers will wait longer.
3. They queueing is all crammed close together, very unsafe covid wise.
4. Had a lovely holiday! Returning is just as bad. 45 minute wait, sometimes more for customs to look at your passport!

Worst airport experience I have ever had. Ps. Over the years I have flown to 39 countries.",1
Dropped someone off and exit to drop off point was shut so had to pay £6 to leave. £2 for every minute I was there. Absolute scam.,1
Absolutely the worst airports I've ever been too!! Staff and security extremely rude to everyone one. So small dirty. It is an embarrassment to the city,1
"If it could be zero stars, it would be. Mean-spirited, tatty and with staff that might be judged too cruel for the average prison. Quite simply the worst airport you're likely to suffer through.",1
"How soon they forget not yet out of COVID . 7 June 2021
Arrivals toilet dirty no soap or toilet paper  in both men and woman’s .
This is Management at its worst .
This airport is a disaster just waiting to happen if they can’t get basic health safety issues  up to even a minimum standard then how can the airport be SAFE ?
The efforts and good work by  JET 2 staff are wasted at this airport.

LEEDS BRADFORD AIRPORT  NEEDS NEW MANAGEMENT. !",1
"The on-site taxi service is an utter & absolute disgrace!! At 9.30pm they charged me £55 from LBA to Knaresborough, a distance of 15 miles.
I know inflation is 11.1% - a 41 year high but petrol & diesel costs have been decreasing too. The relevant taxi companies are taking advantage of high costs are clearly ripping LBA passengers off. It's cheaper to fly into Manchester Airport & get the train via Leeds from there! Clearly, there are people coining-in here...a disgrace!",1
Not the airport as such although no checks re covid yesterday. More the awful taxi service who are contracted to the airport. Arrow are shocking landed at 1am and told upto 2 hour wait. Look at reviews not an isolated incident. Actualy easier to get back from Manchester and will look at flying from there next time. Questions need asking as to do they actually want the contract anymore,1
"Avoid flying from this airport with Ryanair! We had 14 hours of an overnight delay 4 days ago, were promised to have accommodation and transport arranged, but all we got was food & drink voucher that we could only spend on a cold sandwich and a bottle of water! Bear in mind, I'm 28 weeks pregnant and I had to sleep on the cold floor with my toddler!",1
"Terrible experience returning to Leeds Bradford airport. The plane couldn't have stopped any further away from the terminal building, this resulted in a 10 minute walk with bags and children at 3am. Then the que for border control was the same length as all the gates inside the terminal. And to top it off there was a que the same length as the entire baggage hall just to exit the airport through one narrow corridor. Won't be using you again LBA.",1
"This is really poor. We have been waiting cramped at the gate for 1 hour already with no information on departure. No toilet, no seat, no ventilation. Kids crying in distress. I asked if I could do to the toilet and they wanted to take my passport off me!!!",1
"The worst airport I travelled from. Very overcrowded, air con not working and no seats. Very unsafe if fire or emergency!!!",1
"If you got any other choice other than this airport make sure you go for it!

Looong waits no matter business or economy, ambiguous signs, limited staff, extra questions on arrival.

Go farther, should be worth it",1
Worst Airport in England  a long way to walk from car park in the cold wind rain and snow to the terminal building  security is always a nightmare not very efficient the terminal building is old and scruffy toilets filthy !!! on return to LBA from our fantastic holiday with jet2 holidays miserable faced  UK border control staff  not a smile on any of there faces to welcome you back home into our country then to find damaged luggage for the second time of coming through LBA very substandard  zero star ps j2 were amazing great holiday thank you j2holidays,1
"Parking was closed on arrival, no directions of where to go. Took nearly 3 hours to get through security without checking in a bag. Paid for fast track and still went as slow. People skipping the queue constantly. Terrible organisation and severely understaffed. Would not fly from there again.",1
Appalling wait to go through security. The whole airport is dirty. Toilets are broken. Massive understaffing problems. Avoid this airport if you can. Probably illegally over crowded.,1
"Just a mess every time you go, it's so dirty everywhere you look. Smoking cage is like something from jurassic Park, hit and miss when staff are polite, I always lie and say I fly from Manchester because leeds needs a good clean! I'm from Leeds too!",1
I refuse to come back here again even to fly after collecting a family member from a flight I was charged £20 in the CAR PARK they are making a fortune robbing people of money. No other means of collection or drop off stitched up to rob you either way…. Disgusting. When the economy is close to collapse and you’ll need our support I’m sorry to say I’ll be supporting the business’ that served the people not robbed the people,1
"I don't like it, there is always a long way to go to passport control after landing.  It took me 10 minutes to walk and then I have to go to the first floor with bags without automatic stairs, I am not happy with this airport.",1
Long queue for security going right out into the car park which I expected but nothing prepared us for the temperature inside. No air con and unbelievable temperature at 06-00. Expected to be a hot day today so later on will be torture. Leeds Bradford always has the ability to be worse in all aspects every time you use it.,1
Left here Monday 16th. Firstly many thanks to security and catering staff for their politeness and efficient work in these stressful times due to poor management. Overheard several staff who would have organised everything far better than the 'management'. Perhaps they should promote 'working'staff and lay off management. Poorly organised causing unecessary stress for people. Pilot  and crew even get held up in security!!!!!,1
"Terrible. Diverted to East Midlands then bussed back to LBA at 1am knowing it was closed. Dumped there for over 5 hrs, freezing cold & no facilities. Even the toilets were disgusting. Very bad indeed.",1
"Absolute rip off of a place, stopped for approximately 1 minute just outside the barrier and recieved a penalty notice today of £100 reduced to £60 if paid in 14 day's, i only stopped cause wasn't sure which carpark to go in, thx Leeds Bradford airport you are an utter disgrace and will never use your airport again or pick up anyone there.Would of been no star's but it won't let you do that, once again shame on you for making easy money, if you're that desperate for money you can have it, SHAME ON YOU",1
"Well it’s not even school holidays yet and after spending 45 mins in the fast track que the organisation of this airport is an absolute joke. God knows what it will be like in the holiday season. Ten flights leaving within 2 hours and only one scanner open, that’s over 2000 passengers Absolute Joke they should be ashamed 27/4/22",1
"Nearly 2 hours late departure (Ryanair), mislaid baggage at destination (SE Spain) which delayed us a further hour. I could've driven 2/3 of the way there in the time it took since leaving home that morning!
Returned to LB only to have to wait for over another hour with the rest of the planes passengers for baggage reclaim!",1
"Forty quid to park for a day, an hour to get through security, a forced walk through 3 ghastly shops, then the gate announced 1 minute before the departure time. This aged airport is a new low.",1
"Lack of 21st Century services. Fast Track has been cancelled because it is not fast?????????

Update: Returned from 2-week vacation and surprise surprise surprise - the sub-standards at this airport do not surprise me any more. They have improved the beer drinking areas, but the luggage collection area is a disaster and for a county shrouded in rain there are no facilities to protect luggage from the rain.

This airport needs more work before it can be considered on par with other European Airports.",1
"From the drop off the experience just gets worse. Free drop off too far away and 2 people cannot pass when pulling 2 cases. Not a smooth path that allows your case to run well. Long queues through security. Extra long walk through Duty Free with nothing that could count as a bargain from high street prices. Over priced food and Drink in the bars & cafes. Miserable looking staff (except Jet2). Scruffy walk to plane under what could have been built during the war dirty tin shed.

Coming back no escalator up the steps to passport control. Where there is one I have never seen it work. Long wait for bags in a dismal 2 conveyor belt baggage reclaim. Bags arrived after another flight that came in after ours. Over priced Taxis that have a monopoly over other taxi firms because of the extortionate charges for getting anywhere near the terminal.

At last home and the only saving grace is that I live only 5 minutes away. If I didn't live so near I would never ever use this Airport.

Arrived at airport 3 hours before flight to be told by Ryan air staff bag drop not open until 2 hours before departure. Went to automatic check in printed off bag tag and dropped bag in oversize drop no problem. Do not believe jumped up self important staff. Went to White Rose executive suite great service and good value.",1
"Business Lounge refused Access as a Priority  Card Holder for years.
I travelled the World first I ever been refused. Not impressed the Airport in general awful Security of which I been engaged in a my life both in Iraq and other area's in the World Awful.",1
This would be a perfectly nice airport were it not or the absurd and obscene £5 charge for the privilege of dropping someone off there. A process that takes literally 30 seconds. That's a car park space costing the equivalent of £600 an hour. Seriously. What a joke.,1
Security queuing out the door snaking all the way around the airport. Good luck hearing the tannoy...,1
"The building needs to be freshened up and extended to meet its needs, the staff are mostly friendly. The quality, cleanliness and price of the food in Burger King soured the visit for me, £27 for 3 chicken burgers that were small and burnt, that didn't include chips or a drink. Disappointing to get ripped off for kids food.",1
"One of the worst airports I have ever used, and I have travelled widely over more than 40 years.

It is always dirty - floors, windows, corners throughout, including the security area.
The layout is terrible, from the assault course from the car parks to the entrance, to the cramped overcrowded waiting areas and caged, draughty corridors  to the tarmac.
The tannoy system is useless. It is almost impossible to hear the announcements
The finishes to the walls, floors, ceilings are shoddy.
There is an overwhelming feeling that the airport is there to extract as much money from the customers as possible, from the exorbitant “drop off” charges, to the monopoly of the taxi cab firms, to the re-zoning of already cramped waiting areas to make more business class lounges.
Support for disabled travellers is patchy. The employees are very friendly and helpful, but it is rare for there to be enough of them to assist all the pre-booked passengers.
I strongly recommend that those in charge of the airport should firstly visit the airport as customers, both with and without restricted mobility, and follow the route from the car park to the planes by wheelchair and on foot. Secondly, make a visit to another airport to see how things should be done, and how clean they are.",1
"This has to be the world's worst airport very little seating. Pretty much everyone is sitting on the ground. Escalators are not working, trash everywhere and a mile long wait for security. This is absurd and an ambarrastment of an airport.",1
"Dreadful experience. Massively understaffed. Check in staff for all departure areas are severely under trained.
Sat on tarmac for 50 minutes, in 30c heat as not enough staff to load bags onto plane before departure time. Disgraceful.",1
"The worst airport in England.
Queues,queues and queues.
Not enough staff and they do not care about this.
People waiting 2 hours  to border control🤦
Terrible management.
Please avoid if possible",1
"Security as bad as everyone says- not worse but 100+ minutes in a queue is not good. Staff great throughout the airport but the space, facilities and overall experience were not.",1
"Terrible, nightmare,what happened with all the staff missing, never experienced the queuing in all the visits I have made at the airport. We STOOD 2 hrs in the checking in.. Then another 2 hrs FOR SECURITY. They were having to pull people out of the queues to get their flights. AWFUL",1
"Completely inefficient airport. First, you find a huge lines for security control (arriving almost to the entrance of the airport); once there, a lack of machines to check the tickets follows it (a person does it for you, but she tries it once or twice -no changing positions of the phone or anything- and if it does not work, they send you back to baggage check-in area, where they make you make all the line to print the ticket) to finally encounter a slow bag inspection. Luckily, we arrived more than enough time before, otherwise we would not have made it.",1
"As a long time supporter of L B A I find my patience wearing thin. Useless. directions to parking which left me and others unable to exit the car park, escalators not working and no air bridge, Manchester here we come.",1
"The airport cannot cope with the volume of passengers. The bars and public lounges are very crowded and many choices of advertised food were no longer supplied or sold out. Poorly signed and very dirty long walk to departure gates where different queues mingled and mixed to cause more confusion. The return journey through the airport was abysmal. Landed at 01:00, again long dirty traipse to the passport control.  Waiting for luggage on one of the 2 working carousels at which time, although one of our suitcases had come through, the remainder of our planes (TUI) luggage  was held up for a Jet 2 flights luggage to be put on the carousel. This flight landed half an hour after our flight. No warning or information was given for this, No communication at all.  Still waiting for the remainder of our suitcases to come through when they were spotted on the other carousel.  Two hours after landing we caught the bus to the car park. Do you think we will use this airport again?",1
£8 for dropping off holiday makers and an astronomical £54 to get out after we overstayed a few minutes in the free 1 hour parking please beware !!!!,1
"AVOID AIRPORT LOUNGES

The stay was very pleasant for the first hour or so until we left for a cigarette, taking our bags with us as we did not want to leave them unattended. When we returned, we were told by the manager that we would not be allowed to re-enter as our flight had been called for boarding.

We then went to check and found that our gate was not due to be announced for another 50 minutes.

Consequently, we returned and entered the lounge, speaking to another member of staff who confirmed we would be fine to stay until our gate was announced and he instructed the lady behind the bar we could continue to use the lounge facilities.

The lady behind the bar then received a call from the manager and she stopped pouring our drinks.

A few moments later the manager stormed into the lounge and not only embarrassed us but embarrassed herself as she began to shout at us in front of the entire lounge. Understandably confused and annoyed as we had paid good money for us only to be shouted down to by an unprofessional member of staff with a personal agenda against us, we left. When I explained we would be making a formal complaint, the manager changed her tune and began to speak to me as you should a paying customer, rather than shouting over anything I tried to say.

I will not be returning until i receive a satisfactory response to the complaint i have made and this review will remain here until such time.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS

Manchester Airport Lounges trump LBA both in quality of food and drinks and in customer service.",1
Bunch of idiots who manage this airport. Got covid after waiting in massive queues last week. No control over what is going there. If you want to ruin your holiday use this airport. Ridiculously no oone seems to care about covid anymore there. 1000s of people waiting in a queue for check in and then security.,1
"Absolutely shocking service. My luggage has been left with their courier service for a week now. I have rang every day and keep getting told my bag will definitely be with me 'tomorrow', I am constantly having to chase for any kind of update. I put a complaint in and still no one has contacted me, will never use this airport again",1
"There are lots of flights delayed, people already feel stressed and tired. Temperature in Leeds today is 28, inside the terminal was like a big oven. Air conditioning is turned off, disgraceful",1
"Awful on 5.9.18
No bus to take us from the plane so we stood for over 20 minutes to get off.
40 minutes to get through passport control, what a joke that was and to complete the experience....being picked up outside, arrival already delayed by an hour, queues to get out of the car park moving very slowly with car park charges jumping up to £9 then £ 21 then ????dread to think.
People understandably getting pissed off ......if there's a next time, I'll jump on the bus. It was better at Pisa.
Ok, complaint over now, gotta walk off the pizza and pasta......",1
"Very old airport, not enough airbridges to connect the aircrafts which is very inconvenient for passengers  since UK weather is not the best and many times  have to go walking under the rain .
in general in not well maintained,  toilets are dirty and smell bad .
the baggage belt was broken.
for the amount of tax we paid we deserve a lot better than this.",1
"Airport was rammed full no wear to sit or stand all bars and restaurants had massive que, and no air-conditioned it was red hot worse ever airport cost,",1
"What a horrible airport this is. We only use it as it’s nearest to where we live. It’s crowded, full of drunks, too small to cope with the level of passengers trying to transit through the airport. The toilets are always broken or out of order as well as being woefully inadequate. The security process is antiquated and held in what appears to be a portakabin stuck on the side,and as for the arrivals and baggage collection...well what a load rubbish. Never waited so long for my bags in my life. The plane can only land a few hundred yards away,why take so long!!!! The airport seriously needs upgrading and expanding. To describe it as Leeds/Bradford International is something that the trades and descriptions people should get involved in.....nightmare.",1
Arrived Friday 22nd July to collect my mum from a Ryanair flight from fuertaventura. 2+ hours to land and get through arrivals. A bloody disgrace. I wish I could give zero stars but I can't.,1
"Absolutely terrible airport, very lazy staff, waiting to check in or security checks literally took us an hour each, throughout the check in/bag drop the person working there walked off to have a conversation with another employee and made about 30+ people including my family wait. The burger king there was like going to a dump, trash all over the floors, old and rotten chips everywhere, the customers had to wipe down the tables themselves and piles of dust everywhere. Absolutely in a bad standard and very dirty, would not recommend.",1
The airport is a disgrace to charge £6.00 just to drop a member of the family off. We will not be using this airport again.,1
Im absoluty disgusted with ssp company at the  leeds and bradford airport . sacking people whats only started a  job with them since the summer   . so bascally there using people when its busy . and when its quiet there going round getting rid of people for no reason . im really shocked of what theyve done to my daughter .,1
The toilet facilities in baggage claim were truly disgusting! The smell from them was overpowering. Uk border control takes forever it's not efficient and can't cope if more than one plane lands at once! Impossible to find anything gluten free to eat whilst there. Car park is a joke! Having to pay £3 for 30 minutes even though dad was in the car park less than 5 mins. Compared with airports anywhere else this is very very poor.,1
It was always expensive for food and drink which you put up with because you were just passing through and it was the only game in town but now they are taking the mick. Disgracefully high prices. Bring your own sarnies and pop cos these grifters would charge you for breathing if they could.,1
1st time using this airport and definitely the last !!! Bring back Doncaster as quickly as possible,1
"Worst experience ever. Went here instead of my local airport at Newcastle never again no matter the deal. Expensive car park. Toilets disgusting as soon as you enter or leave. Had assistance from lovely young guy up to security. This was chaos antiquated unmotivated and purely awful. Well organised for my help at departure. So busy cramped airside and was told this was quiet would hate to be there when busy. On return i needed wheelchairassistance as around 6 others did we waited 45 minutes for two guys to offload and wheel to security you were pushed into the lift 1 by 1 then a nightmare getting us all    t hrough. People are going on holiday longer and needing assistance and this will require more staff, get a grip we will never be back.",1
Delays getting off planes. Not the airlines fault but LBA.  45 minute delay for luggage and still waiting.  Only information came from the pilot.  Extremely poor and testament to the industry at present,1
"Not great. Hire car is too far away you have to get a bus. Problem also is that the bus every 5 min is not every 5 min on way in it took 20. On way back me and a air hostess was waiting so long she was late for work, i nearly missed my flight even tho i was at the airport a hour before it left.  Security is very slow but thats ok however gate 10 is so far away the screen does not tell anyone its a 10/ 15 min track through the narrow shop that they all seem to make you walk through just to piss you off and walk the lenght of the runway. Sorry guys but one star max.",1
"Arrived at LBA what can I say ! Staff on security rude waited 30mins for security to check in oversized bag no apology… I was greeted where  busy… , massively understaffed at coffee shop waited over 1/2 for a coffee … do yourself a favour go to East Midlands or Manchester …",1
Shocking Congestion at security on way out(about 1 hour to get through). On return 70 minutes from aircraft landing to collect case. This airport is a complete and utter disgrace. Newcastle Airport far far superior. Best advise is to avoid if possible.,1
"Having read up on the airport I thought I would have an easy first experience on the first time I was using it for an early morning flight to Milan.
Unfortunately, despite arriving there pre-checked in and an hour and a half before the flight was due to take off, security was so overloaded and incompetent that 4 of us failed to make the gate on time.
The only positive to come out of it was that the airport agreed to pay for a taxi to Manchester airport although not for the extra £110 flight charge not any compensation for the time wasted (best part of a day).
Will not be using here again, my advice would be to give it at least 2 hours just to get through security, longer if you need to check in",1
"Was left sat on plane for ages.
I had requested wheelchair assistance and was left waiting at the bottom of plane steps until some one came to get me.
WS not impressed.",1
"Passenger drop off should be free. £3 is a scam. The other free drop off has been purposely placed at a distance that no one would use it. Also this airport has NO WATER FOUNTAIN. POOR AIRPORT going too far to make a profit. Basics of water are a bare minimum, free drop off should be provided too. Otherwise a smooth transition through the airport.",1
"The worst airport in the entire world! Staff are rude the facilities are a joke its overcrowded and has terrible transport links. It's still the worst airport on the planet three years after I wrote this original review! They are obsessed with parking.
2022 update. Still not fit for purpose.",1
"Abysmal airport. Lots spent on shopping etc to make money from passengers, but none spent on making the airport a useable and friendly place to arrive/depart from. I arrived on tuesday 28May 2019, to a 250 yard long queue at passport control, yet only four out of seven passport gates were open. Arrivals can be forecast and steps taken to have enough staff there. When I asked the passport control operative why all 7 gates weren't managed, he sarcastically told me ""because we're busy"". And as for the car parking.......ridiculous that the much heralded ""free for one hour"" car park doesn't have a transfer bus to the terminal. It's £3 to collect someone from the termial, and heaven knows how much if you overstay your time. Leeds Bradford Airport is an unpleasant customer experience.",1
"Parking at £13.00 an hour what the he'll do you think it's like, total rip off. There should be a law preventing this type of over charging its disgraceful.",1
"You have to pay to drop people off, and even then you can't go up to the door, not great with older relatives. You have to pay for a luggage trolley and then there are no places to return them near the bus stops! They never say the gate numbers until they are boarding.
Security is always very slow, similar story with passport control. Probably better going to Manchester Airport.",1
"Worst airpirt in the world. Everything, staff, facilities, building. Awoid if you only can",1
"The airport is poorly decided, inside it's small and cramped, when there was delay of plane arriving hour later (and therefore it left hour later), they provided NO updates for that. Worst airport I've ever been in",1
"It's disgusting! It's a dump! They should close this one not Doncaster! Robin Hood was a proper airport!
AVOID IF YOU CAN
Update 09 08 2023
Nothing changed.
Still terrible.",1
3 hours queue then rushed onto plan .smelly toilets .empty departure lounge no one just time to shop or buy a drink . Shoddy experience. No doubt the fat cats 9n charge will still get a bonus. Shocking.,1
"Don't bother with the premier lounge. It used to be good but now there's a choice of 3 and we stupidly thought the most expensive one would be the best choice. The food was awful and only get offered one meal which was only a jacket potato. The drinks are included but not much choice. As for the return arrival it's shocking impossible if you have a push chair or wheel chair as its all stairs with no lifts or escalators. The passport checking took litterally hours, the luggage belts had 4 different flights on one belt. There's simply not enough space for people and as you can imagine after 2 hours to get through passport control people manners and patients are thin when it comes to collecting you bags.",1
Too small for the amount of people.  Impossible to sit somewhere to eat and drink,1
Never liked this airport and today is no exception. Check in for Jet2 is at one end and security and departure at the other end. (All walk). Got sent at security to fast track section to find no one there so had to queue to get back in line. Had only three items of clothing left on and still had to go through the scan machine and get frisked. You are made then to walk all the way through duty free to the cattle market they call a departure lounge. £2.99 for bottle of water and £3.45 for. Latte,1
"Picked up my brother last week from there. I have NEVER seen such a disaster of an airport. You have to have way too much money for parking. Even if you just want to drop someone off you have to pay. It's not possible to park or even stop the car for a minute, because the police will come right away and tell you to move on!!! Unbelievable! The flight of my brother left on time and arrived on time, but was not allowed to land, so we had to wait over an hour and paid over 16 pounds! No information about all of this on the website or on the internet except in the reviews. If you can avoid this airport, do it!",1
"Rip off dropping off charge. Obstacle course to negotiate to check in. Long walk along uneven tarmac to planes. Escalators always out of service. Dopey security staff. If it wasn't 5 miles from where I live I wouldn't use it. Requires renaming to Mickey Mouse 'International' Airport.
*edit March 2022 *
All the above still applies, the delays at security and immigration have got worse.",1
Absolute shambles hours long queue for security and nobody there to help at checkin either. You'll probably miss your flight if the airport doesn't make changes.,1
The airport is absolutely disgusting! My cases came off the plane covered in mud like they'd been dragged across a field. Its not clean at all.,1
"Went through the checkout told to remove my flat boots while my other half with his clod hoppers on sailed through. Then the security thing thing beeped on passing through so told to go in the body scanner. So stood in that, no one told me what to do. All staff stood about too busy talking to each other. I looked about, do I stay or do I leave? No one said anything. Walked out. Total shambles. Your staff need more training. Absolute joke.",1
"The only good thing about this airport is leaving it. Very bad organized for a small airport. We needed about 50 minutes to pass the security check. Not clean, not enough places to sit and it smells bad. Worst airport I have been so far in my life.",1
"As a frequent traveller I have been quite few airports and this one of one of the bad ones. Mostly the staff, seems they were very undertrained and didn't know what to do. Mostly just wondering around and atmosphere was very uncomfortable as they were chatting a lot amongst themselves and laughing which seemed many times to be towards people coming. The worst bit was when suitcase of one of the travellers was stopped for extra security check which is fine. But the way of doing it is something I have never seen before. They asked to open it and then started taking EVERYTHING out into a tray!!! Right there in front of everybody! Including laundry and personal stuff!  If you HAVE to (and I believe you DO NOT) do that there has to be a place to do it privately rather than exposing your whole suitcase in front of everybody inside the security but also outside as the tray had to go again through. Horrible!!!",1
"Could the staff be any more rude. The security gate has people sat around doing nothing and then when they get a rush on ...4 people, they start moaning.
It goes something like...'empty your bags please, belts and boots in the tray..laptops,ipads in the tray'
You make the mistake of leaving a credit card in your pocket and all hell breaks loose.
Men and women at the scanner..'why do we bother..ooh l know' . When you are in earshot. Doncaster or Manchester l think next time.",1
Passenger assistance was appalling when arriving back from Spain no ambilift a available had to wait hour half then ended up walking down steps due to lack of ground staff ( not the plp who run passager assistance fault ) Leeds Bradford Airport fault,1
If I can I'll will leave - 10 for this airport. Horrible horrible people are there and the service are ridiculous. Never ever will travel from this airport again. Also I going write complain about the custom officer she was talk nasty to my 8 years old nephew and stop him and looking into his little suitcase and than she told him he is carrying drugs he start cry and having panic cry and I couldn't stop her to abuse him. When I told her to stop and we no gonna catch the fly she went its not her problem.In the end she didn't find anything obviously! Ridiculous horrible nasty person.,1
Terrible terrible terrible. Been waiting in line to go through security for well over an hour now and looks like it’ll be another hour before I get close to going through. They should be fined for this. How can they book all these flights with the lack of facilities to cope. Terrible management.,1
"Jet 2 flight was fine, but the airport was chaotic. Passport checking took longer than expected, but a broken exit door brought everything to a halt. It took about 45 minutes to clear the airport. Still got to get to the car!",1
"Awful airport, got delayed at Malaga for 2 hours sat on the plane before take off to then have an hour delay at leeds getting us through passport control with miserable staff. Toilets are disgusting with water all over the floor and the smell was horrendous. Got charged an extra £15 for parking as we'd gone over our time due to delays. Awful to get to with little sign posting and no direct train links! I will never travel from this airport again ! Would sooner travel further to fly from Manchester!",1
The staff here are absolutely VILE and the way they treat passengers with luggage issues is beyond poor. I will never ever fly from this hole again!,1
"Avoid this airport if at all possible. Been to a few and can confirm this is the worst I’ve ever had the displeasure of walking through.

Staff are sub par, security are overzealous and full of ego.",1
LBA still ranks for me as one of the most inefficient airports in the UK. 5 quid for a drop off. Then security is a carcrash..5 flights leaving between 6 and 7 and 1 security line open. Let's face it....its not a surprise in terms of flights and passenger numbers...people planning this should be shot. If I could give it zero I would.,1
"I fly a lot and this is the worst airport ever, comparable even with some quite remote airports in Africa or Asia.
Dirty and stinky toilets, dirty public places, limited sitting area. Shame on leadership of that place!
Absolutely awful.",1
"Terrible webpages for Arrivals and Departures... 4 hour delay for any information on flight status... awful performance...

5 years later after first review, there is still a problem with poor air ventilation, the wifi seems about 10 years old and is unstable, there is a lack of space in the terminal building general to cope with peak flight periods and there is still no free water facilities unlike most other UK airports now. Instead the only option is to buy water in over priced plastic bottles. This I hope will change soon as part of the Airport's 2030 net zero carbon plan, yes management?",1
Time to renew my review. Sadly nothing changes. It’s like passengers are an inconvenience that surprises them by turning up. They talk about levelling up and a northern powerhouse but whilst Yorkshires main airport continues to be an embarrassment to the county nothing will change. I call on the airlines and Jet2 to put more pressure on the management to sort out this shambles.,1
The most unorganized airport I have ever been to. From charging the cabs 3 pounds to drop you off to check in not knowing which gate the flight leaves from its chaos. Whoever runs this place should be fired immediately.,1
"Small, but very busy airport, mainly with low-cost flights. Very bad signs on the way from Leeds, and NO petrol station! I came with a rented car and it was quite late. It took me more than 1 hour to locate an open petrol station 5 miles away, in the middle of nowhere!!! My other option was to pay 3,6 GBP per liter to Hertz.",1
I am disabled and requested assistance  prior to my flights. I and six other disabled passengers were left waiting over an hour on the plane. This is disgusting behaviour and unacceptable.,1
The way I've been treated last night by the border control lady who searched me and my partner for cigarettes is disgusting! I've been shout at to get out! We are coming here to work and we pay taxes ! You've got no right to do that!,1
"Leeds Bradford Airport is by far the worst airport I have ever used. Firstly its full of people getting wasted at 6am. All I heard was drunk people with pints of beer swearing, this was everywhere you looked. I thought Glasgow was bad but this is 100 times worse. No police presence at all. Its like the airport is promoting getting people drunk blind firstb thing in the morning. Then on the plane wasted passengers allowed on the plane chanting viking like songs and being sick saying the most obscene words imaginable infront of children and civilised people. The airport and airline should never have served alcohol to people this early in the morning and not let them on a plane. The check in staff who were employees of the airport and not the airline (aer lingus) are the stupidest people I have ever come across anywhere in the world, only one employee handling the plane check in also and it took hours (yet a switch off occurred), my luggage never got on the plane even though I was there in line 2 ,hours before departure. Its clear this airport charges top dollar for passengers but pays the minimum for employees and training and management , this airport is very poor and extremely low on facilities. Irony is that you wait a very long time to go through security but they dont mind when 90% of passengers are so drunk they can hardly stand, thats ok in there eyes. Surely thats not safe. Also they need to actually realise children are in the airport and silence the most offensive language you can imagine. Leaving this airport is like being in a crowd at a leeds united football match but instead of controlled by police its controlled b?y suburnban hairdressers or x factor / pop idol wanna be's that wouldnt make the cut.
I suggest this airport actually hires management that understands business travel and not just holiday flights to alicante. I huge embarrassment for the city it serves and for the human race at large. I could go on.",1
"Even Mickey Mouse wouldn't fly out of here if he had an option. Staff are great but parking, access, space around arrivals to greet guests. It's expensive and embarrassing.",1
"Compared to Manchester and Liverpool JL, this is by far the worst and most dated airport. Lounge area is not big enough for the people that go through this airport. Air quality is extremely poor. The less time you spend inside the building, the better.
For smokers there is a smoking area which is like a prison cell, and you have to pay to use it.
Avoid if you have a choice.",1
Drop off and pick up charges are a rip off and should not be allowed it took me 7 minuets in and back out the charge for taking passengers which this airport needs to survive is £3 each time and goes up if your not quick to drop off. Disgusting and a rip off.,1
"Jumped up jobsworth at Gate insisted I forced my hand baggage into size checker. Have used this bag for over 5 years, never been asked before. Fits easily under seat in any aircraft, but it's a bit square shaped so width is tight even though volume is fine. Got bag all the way in except a 2cm wheel - at which point he said sarcastically ""all the way in"". Crazy thing then, I simply took bag back out, removed some paper then rammed it back it - which was then fine!! And I got a nice purple ""baggage approved"" sticker label. So, listen up everyone - you can now take whatever size bag you like, as handbag just empty your contents into a carrier bag whilst you show them the bag fits. Genius. Then when on plane, I took photos of us taking off with baggage obstructing cabin - in breach of aviation rules. Airline name may follow soon..",1
"Shocking! Our family recently travelled to Tenerife, we had to check-in at the airport as on line one was unavailable for that flight. Woman working at the check - in desk made a complete mess allocating seats in the aircraft. There were 4 of us travelling and she allocated all different seats, I wouldn't be bothered, but my 4 year old daughter was suppose to be sitting on her own, six rows in front of us!!!! Absolutely ridiculous! We were in 26, 27, 28 rows and poor child was allocated to 20th row!? Big thank you for the flight attendants, they were brilliant and had us re-seated so we could enjoy flight all together. (Just to clarify: we were not late for our flight, actually we  arrived pretty early and were one of the first passengers to check in for the flight).",1
"Parking lots aren't properly marked (both Mid Stay 1 and Mid Stay 2 are marked as ""Mid Stay"" despite being in two different locations and the £5 to DRIVE THROUGH the lot even if you are just trying to turn around is a scam. On top of that they put double reds everywhere so if you stop trying to find the bloody way because their email instructions are useless you'll be fined £100!

Terminal itself is grimy, jumped up staff, zero announcements - my gate was set to open at 8:25pm, walked up to the screen at 8:30 only to see the gate closing while there was still a big queue to it because the staff forced everyone to measure their bags.

Absolutely appaling, won't use again and I seriously recommend you stay away.",1
"COMPLE JOKE AND I MEAN IT. BE CAREFULL IF U CARRYING MORE THAN £1000 POUND IN CASH.
I had a flight from LBA TO Southampton and had £2800 cash in my bag. I was stopped by security and called police to investigate. I was told that if u have more than £1000 in cash than they have to report it to police which is complete joke. Rule is that you can carry £10000 in cash even you going on international flight.
I was only traveling to local flight. I had all the proof that i am business traveller and going to collect my car from Southampton port that's why i have the cash. But seems like they are making their own rules (Explanation was that it is small air port and if u have over £1000 in you pocket than it will be reported to police). who suffers the traveller.
it took them over an hour to check my background and i was cleared but guess what i missed my flight. Ruins my day because of £2000 pound which is bloody nothing these days and when i had all proofs.
When i asked desk about re booking than i was told that its not their fault that security stopped me. I have to pay it again for my flights.

Thank you all jokers there.",1
security check was a joke. only one belt open and very close crowding then another dangerous queue for the body scanner.  asked to place items in tray when other people were still at very close distance. breeding ground for covid.  jet2 checkin was fantastic though.,1
"If I could give 0 stars I would do this. Lack of organisation. Few planes flying out in similar time and they open one, ONE line for security check?
Bloody disaster. I will never ever fly from there even if that would be the cheapest option in whole UK. F£&k this airport!",1
"Arrived 2 hours earlier as recommended. Due to the queue on check in's and security check I had to run not miss my flight. ""Thankfully"" my flight was late so I had a chance to go for lunch but only junk food available.",1
"Money grabbing Thieves

Charge £3 just to drop off  and pick up passengers, the road layout has been changed to force vulnerable drivers into the carpark where you must pay the £3 to be able to leave.
They have CCTV searching for people dropping off passengers along the relatively quiet road in front of the airport where you will be slapped with a £70 fine even if your stopped for less than 30 seconds.",1
"The worst AirPort i ever been too with workers that obviously dislike white customers
Everything is barely working.",1
"Have always used and enjoyed traveling from this airport. More flights are being offered more executive lounges are put in place but the tiny security areas stay the same. Yesterday 8 flights at same time ours,we were second to land our cases arrived on belt last cases on other belts, no passengers through passport control hence cases jammed falling on floor utter chaos. No doubt same thing will happen today not good Leeds Bradford sort it out",1
"This is a terrible airport, totally unorganised, dreadful facilities, dirty, poor communication.   Never again and I would rather drive further to Manchester than use this place again.   Avoid if you want a pleasant start to your holidays",1
Joke of an airport. All staff are there to do is eat crisps and aimlessly walk around avoiding anything that remotely smells like work. Easily 40 staff doing absolutely nothing except 2 young lads working for Swissport who eventually helped us retrieve our bag after 3 hours of being ignored.,1
Worst airport experience ever! Waited over half an hour for somebody to put bus for us to get out of the airport after landing airport staff were too busy doing nothing,1
"How can the management have the cheek, to charge their customers pick up and drop off fees, when they don't have a decent  covered walk way, to protect their customers from the bad weather,at Englands highest airport.
This has been a problem for a very long time and they have the nerve to charge us to be wet and cold.",1
"Sat on plane 4 hours as it snowed, LBA are notorious for closing the airport if it snows. Needs another airport. The location is terrible to get to and no infrastructure to keep it open.
Also the runway is in the wrong direction for winds up here",1
Leeds Bradford airport is like a cattle  market  all crammed into to such small area's with so little seating arrangements,1
"A laughing stock. I’m used to the shocking service here however arrived with friends from Holland and they thought they had arrived 50 years in the past.

Only got 2 buses so can’t handle multiple arrivals. Passport control is so slow it’s a joke and baggage takes forever to arrive. Possibly the worst airport in the world",1
"LBA doesn't even deserve 1 star, I've used various airports in the UK, LBA is my local airport but this is the worst I've experienced. Firstly Yorkshires Airport security is a joke, one X-ray screening machine in operation at the busiest time of the year, security staff are rude and need to learn some customer service skills because that it what we are customers. Fed up of being treated as someone at the other end of the spectrum. Once you get through security and have to navigate the duty free maze as now familiar at all local airports seating capacity is poor, handling agents Swissport are also useless,  so many times called to the gate and have to stand for ages waiting for a despatcher to be able to board to plane. LBA is a joke and needs to step up, if your going to market yourselves as Yorkshires Airport sort yourselves out apply some simple customer service to the entire operation.",1
"The dirtiest airport I have ever been to, seats were rotten and the toilets were disgusting, will never fly from there again",1
"It cost me about £10 just to pick some one up, I must have been in the car park all of half an hour tops, foreboding building .scruffy looking airport, also the way in was strange I drove up a dirt track to enter the airport. Whilst I don't mind going off road, it just seems a little bit odd that it was the obvious and logical sign posted way in. Like some kind of back country airport from the undeveloped world. Other than that I thought it was fine.",1
"I picked my wife up with my 2 young children the other week. I parked met my wife and was back in my car within 10 minutes. Little did I know I had to pay £4.00 for parking and could only pay in the terminal. Why are there no pay machines in the car park? No signs saying where to park, where to pay and why On earth is it so much???

Get your act together LBA",1
"I was asked to drop off a colleague to catch a plane, and agreed. I checked the web site to get directions, and found the post code and the following - ""We also have a dedicated One Hour Free Parking Zone that is ideal for picking up passengers. Simply follow the road signs from Whitehouse Lane where you’ll find the entrance opposite to Travelodge."" I followed the post code and it took me to the airport, followed a sign on the road to drop off point and dropped him off. I stopped for around 10 seconds to allow him to get out of the car, and was gone. The barrier wouldn't lift when I got to it, and a rude attendant came over and told me that I would have to pay £3.00. I refused and another attendant was called over, who very coarsely told me to pay up and then walked off. Basically a grotty little airport, difficult to get to, rude staff and a blatant rip off. Not a good advert for our county.",1
"This is quite simply the worst airport I have ever used. I was born  in Leeds but lived in New Zealand for 40 years and I have been through Leeds and Bradford airport many times. It gets worse each time! I recently arrived and left through the airport with a party of international friends and was totally embarrassed. The road network is impossible, so timings are difficult.

Also, nothing works at the airport and the charges are ridiculous. Most importantly, this is hostile environment where no-one takes any responsibility and 'customer care' is a joke. No-one cares.

The assumption that people can interpret the local dialect is misplaced.  They can't. Use standard English. The place seems to have disintegrated into a tribal camp: 'We don't want outsiders (customers) here'. The result: every time I go there I feel ashamed and wonder how non-locals possibly cope in interpreting the announcements and dealing with the indifference to them. The place is filthy. and everything is problematic,  including wifi, security, customs,  queues, broken loos, passenger-flow...

It is indefensible to expect elderly or incapacitated people to stand for hours, walk unacceptable distances and climb so many stairs. As for the car hire pick-up and drop off - they are in such an atrocious state of repair that the experience is like an assault course - hopeless without a 4-wheel driven trolley.

Most importantly, there is NO sign of a manager, or anyone taking responsibility, and it is impossible to speak to anyone. Go to Gatwick and look at how they cope with their thousands and thousands of passengers - with charm and good manners.

If you want to see an effective provincial airport, take time to visit Southampton. It is exemplary.",1
"Please be aware security can be very slow, they quote a queue time of 2 min 30 but my last experience was 20 mins. I have watched the the airport become more and more focused on extracting money from passengers - you now have to pay £3 for a few minutes parking in the drop off area and the monopoly taxis provider (Arrow) is much more expensive than standard Leeds/Bradford fares. Phone SJK Taxis as they are based just down the road.",1
"tried to charge me £90 to drop off a friend!  i used their 1 hour free car park , its £30 if you go over an hour!!! the car park is a long walk with bags, and has a  ridiculous one-way system, it's £6 or £3 if you would like to drop them closer to the terminal, i used their cafe and loos  and returned to the car when i realised i had lost my car park ticket, i informed the car park staff of the situation and they informed me it is £90 for a loss of ticket...................??      i asked them if they thought this was fair, they did not answer.........there is no clear signage or indication, on the ticket or in the car park...........BE WARNED!, luckily the lovely lady in the cafe shop had found and kept the ticket. i gave her a huge hug.",1
"I did write a longer review but it didn't post unfortunately.
Here goes on something shorter.
Doors to toilets , two single ones after another, is just cramped and when someone holds the door for you with unwashed hands I feel this needs addressing for a number of reasons, not least hygiene.
Food overpriced and of such poor quality it was frankly staggering. £15 for a breakfast including toast. It was actually less expensive in Puerto Banus later and of a far superior quality. A long walkway with what looked like straw on the floor to then stand in drizzle waiting to board.
We get battered as customers in this country from every angle, this place is at the sharp end of such shoddy service.
Staff were cheerful and helpful no complaints there.
Welcome to Yorkshire it says.......not a particularly warm one.",1
"On the 26october we travelled to Ibiza we booked in at the Jet2 complex but the flight went from gate seven which is at the other end of the airport, we were a group of four with ages from 70 to 85 ,why weren't buses provided?? Any other airport would provide them this airport since being sold to private investors has gone downhill rapidly,the facade looks good but that is it",1
"Bradford Leeds is a dated airport with a cramped feel about it. Wifi is free but so weak it kept dropping out so often we got sick of it and gave up. Biggest issue for us was the car hire drop off is now almost a kilometre away and when we arrived in the pouring rain, found the offices down there were incomplete with no staff. Dragged our luggage over 50m to the  shuttle bus where we waited 10 or 15 minutes for pick up. Standing room only, of course and I'd guess on a busy day you'll wait for the next bus if the first is full. In retrospect, I should have driven the car into the airport, paid their drop off fee and told the car hire company where I'd left it. Will not go to Leeds again if at all possible - Manchester is a better option in all respects.",1
"There are great airlines advertising travel by air is better, faster, cheaper than trains etc from LBA, but the service at the airport is absolutely appalling. The long stay car parks are not even Tarmac/ level, try pushing a baby pram like we did! We got to the security 2 hours before and just about made it to the gate on time, we had to run with 2 children and a pram. Nobody was even bothered. We live local and never using LBA again, Manchester airport is definitely worth the drive. We just feel sorry for the airlines doing their best, spending all the money advertising and this airport is letting them down. Not up to UK standards.
Ps. On board, flybe (this time) the service was like Majic! We told them why we were late etc, they helped with the children and buggy like they were part of the family!
LBA - unfortunately - Never again!",1
"Terrible airport! They lost my baggage and took more than 48 hours to respond . Nightmare of a situation. At the airport , no staff or great customer service",1
Do not use this airport. Very poorly managed. This is my child sleeping on the floor because were trapped in an area with no toilets waiting for luggage. Have just been told there are no staff to unload the plane.,1
Left stranded for hours with no staff who knew anything to update us,1
"How can this airport charge more to drop of and pick up than any other airport in the UK .... including London! It's not as if space is limited or that anyone would park there for any other reason rather than taking customers to the airport.

I run an airport transfer company so unfortunately have no choice to go there but I'm always keen to point out to my customers about the extortionate prices and how I have to pass them onto themselves.

£6 for a round trip! you're having a f**king laugh.",1
Worst Airporr in the country. No train service. Disabled parking is way too far away from terminal. Arrow taxis are a rip off. Re entering the country from Ireland you go through some weird side entrance and bottleneck at bottom of some stairs. Thats just the obvious. Leeds will never be a Northern power house why'll this excuse for an Airport is our only option.,1
"Nice airport...but the security is a nightmare just manic got pulled for my clear liquid bag not being clear enough 🤣🤣
However I do appreciate that working in such an environment must be awful 😕 and they have a job to do",1
Booked through Booking.com but was refused a boarding pass due to covid restrictions. The airport were wrong. I cannot get a refund for my trip or airport parking and will lose £600 for no fault of my own.,1
"Absolute terrible experience. At security, despite there being multiple staff members, the other machines were not being used, only one scanner was open despite there being a very very long queue. I was also stopped at security, in which they held me for no reason whatsoever for 40 minutes forcing me to miss my flight, after speaking to multiple staff members, none of them decided to help me.",1
"There is no drop off part, you have to pay a minimum of £3.00 when you go there, and it is all one way, and so you cannot avoid it. Best thing to do is turn arouund at the tiny round about and drop you friends off so that they have to walk to the terminal.",1
Brought some international colleagues to the UK via Leeds Bradford and it was embarrassing. Passport queues out into the rain. Cramped and terribly laid out. Bagage hall absolute chaos and a long walk to the pot holed car parking along a path surrounded by litter. Should have been rebuilt years ago. Clearly at breaking point for capacity.,1
"Sucked into medium stay car parking which is absolutely extortionate, once there no way out! Security reminds me of a cattle run with stressed and rude staff, don't appreciate being shouted at 04:30 in the morning. Facilities overcrowded......in short, the pits. Go somewhere else if you can, if not expect the worse sort of airport.",1
Bags didn't arrive for plane to depart 40 min delay no explanation until on plane waited in outdoor boarding area stood up for 40 mins not good enough,1
"Parking for zero minutes costs £3 and there's no way to get out of the one way system without going through a pay barrier, even if you're not picking up or dropping off. No parking attendant in sight after 15 minutes blocking the barrier",1
"Very dirty airport, bar was dirty and there was no one cleaning or collecting left overs/drinks.
Going through security is ALWAYS a nightmare, there is no priority when pregnant or when travelling with small children. This should be a legal requirement and should be enforced!  I was asked to purchase fast track when travelling alone with a 5-month-old baby  and there was no sympathy from the staff at all nor help offered at any stage! DISGRACEFUL",1
"What a terrible place, the worst food I've ever been served. Not a comftable environment at all. No shops. Overpriced duty free.
Fast security, fast lane was slower than the other lanes, just the worst start to any of my holidays ever. I've been looking for an airport lounge.",1
"We were meant to fly yesterday to krackow at 12.25
They took us down to the gate
No
Plane to be told it was diverted to Liverpool
No staff
Nothing
Plane not arriving into Leeds
Our   Plane came from Liverpool after trying to
Land 3 times
Is was a shambles
We wanted to  leave at this time with a lot more
There was one guy called Mohammed he wanted a gold mental
It took us three hours to leave has we had to go thro passport control
We had not left the departure lounge
No Ryanair staff or Swiss staff to help
Just the bosses walked us and looked
This was disgusting
We finally got home at nine pm with loads more
Leeds Bradford
Expect more reviews
Will never use this airport again
After the service yesterday",1
"I travel a lot around the world. This is the most rip off airport that I know. If you want to drop off someone, it costs three pound seven if you don’t park. The free car park is over 300 yards away and the walk is not covered there is no walkway; you have to go on the tarmac.
No taxi rank. You have to walk out of the terminal building in open car park area to a Private Hire taxi booking in a temporary building and pre-pay for a taxi and then wait for it which at busy time can be over 15 minutes.
Passengers dropped off have to walk in the open uncovered car park for about 100 yards. This is most inconvenient in bad weather.
I live in Leeds so forced to use it. If I hade a choice, I will never go there. There are several adverse posts on the website; the airport does not even bother to comment on these.
RIP OFF AIRPORT, EXPLOITING MONOPOLY POSITION. AVOID.....",1
"Shambolic is one of a multitude of words i could use to describe this  airport. Although a more fitting word for this place would be hovel. I have travelled from this airport multiple times somehow deluded that it would improve eventually, however I have been disappointed each time. Having nearly passed out with heat stroke in the so called restaurant area that has the capacity to feed about 20 passengers as opposed to the 500 that require its use, i proceeded to the gate only to find I have an approximate mile long walk through a filthy glass tunnel. Contrary to what awaited us in Palma with the clean moving walkway that provided us with oxygen.  Leeds Bradford airport i'll give you one more chance although i'm almost certain you will fail.",1
"Yorkshire Premier lounge closed at 18.45, told the last flight (19.30 ) was boarding so it was closed - interesting customer service policy.  This and the charging to drop people off at this airstrip will mean I choose elsewhere when I can in future.",1
If I could give zero I would. Absolute disgrace. Waiting hours for security. How they can continue as a Business is farcical. Hardly a surprise that it would be busy given the 'come join unfortunately a holiday which they could never deliver.,1
Not enough staff unfortunately. They tried as best they could but airport was busy and not much staff on. Staff still remained polite among the chaos,1
"This airport is a disgrace to Yorkshire, to go through security takes a good hour as only one X-ray open and only one scanner for people
On our return it was a good mile walk from getting off the plane to getting our cases, I’m bad at walking and there was no warning of this, disgraceful
Then they give you no choice but to use one Taxi company, the one that pays the most, 10.30 at night and it was going to be over an hour wait for a cab in the freezing cold and we were first in the queue, we contacted the airport, they weren’t interested
Never mind expanding they can’t mange what they have, the bosses should be ashamed of there selves",1
"Complete and utter Bar Stewards. You follow the signs to the drop off area and then you can't get out unless you pay £5. No warning, No chance to turn around and you can't reverse the car down a one way system for a mile. Hate these people/companies.",1
Parked today for 2h end up paying 59£ what a joke on sign it was saying can park for short or mid stay and price from 5 to 50£ and put token in and charged me 59£,1
"Hello, today my brother was coming back to Spain with his wife and my nephew(only 6), who brought a toy (plastic sword, like an umbrella size). They had a fantastic time here in England, and my nephew was very happy with his sword (by the way it was a gift from me). They passed the security area without any issue, but as soon as my nephew started playing with it, a women from security came to remove it saying it wasn't a toy. I would like to know what a plastic sword is if it's not a toy. My family doesn't speak English, so they couldn't explain themselves, leaving my nephew very disappointed and cover in tears.
I had some of examples before, where staff from security in this airport were quite rude, especially when people don' t speak English, I know it is not compulsory for employees speak other languages but they could be more polite, only with their body lenguaje.
Very disappointed with security guides.",1
"I would genuinely rather wash my eyes with a belt sander than to ever fly into this filthy dump again, 1 hr wait on the plane for the buses and 1.5hrs in border control at midnight, Leeds Bradford and Jet2, you are a joke.
Lets face it, its a nightmare to get too, the airport terminal looks like its falling to bits, it's so dirty that the rats have moved out, the shopping and dining options are akin to those in an open prison, next time ill swim.
Or go to Birmingham, different class.",1
"Has to be 1 of the worst airports I've been too.
I got here early for my flight and there's nowhere to get food untill security opens at 3am apart for a little shop that sells bottles of water for 3.25sterling and 5pound for 1 small sandwich.. absolute extortion.. the toilets are all blocked and there is flys everywhere such a disgrace.",1
Toilets were very smelly and unable to get a taxi for 40 mins very frustrating!,1
"Leeds Bradford International Airport, more like Mickey Mouse Airport, luggage conveyor not working at check in 06.00hrs, passenger escalator not working, only one bus for transfers, you couldn't make it up. Absolutely appalling airport, and wait until you reenter the UK queues at border control, luggage carousel if they are working! Enough said.",1
"The place is a filthy joke... Guy walking around, panicking, with a megaphone trying to get people through security. Never again Leeds Bradford!",1
"The £3 drop off charge is extortionate. If you want to drop off for free you have to park 10 minutes walk away from the entrance. Which would be fine in a warm sunny country, but given the amount of wind and rain we get it's cruel to force your Mam to walk that.",1
"Disgusted! £3 per car drop off and pick up. Now charging £1 per visit per person to smoking area, no change given. £20 to use premier lounge per person. Fast track is £4 per person. Is there any anything you don't have to pay for? No where near Leeds or Bradford in the sticks.",1
What a joke this place is. They have all their incoming flights landing at the same time and employ 2 baggage handlers to deal with 5 flights landing within 15minutes of each other. You couldn't call this company an organisation as they lack any organisation skills,1
"Flown from here loads of times, I think the dropping off charge is unfare to start with and the food once inside is of very low quality, I used the premier lounge on my last visit and it was so dirty in there I didn't think I was going to sit down!
Again the food was unbelievably poor and the service was not existent( are we supposed to self serve?)
Think in future I'll have an overpriced Burger King instead and a bottled beer so I know what to expect :/",1
"Discraceful airport and staff , no customer care , no communations !!!! 6 hrs delay due weather no information given no refreshments offered a,arrogant staff who take no responsiblity for their passengers . Told to get onto a dirty coach with drivers that stink with cigerette smoke !!!! Never will we use this airport again and would wonder what or how they would deal with an emergency situation",1
"Absolutely joke. Waiting over 30 min for security to collect over size baggage (bike) spoke already with 4 people.
No one around to do a job",1
Terible service start to end car parks dont work. Poor sercice at all amenities. Leave you waitng around upon return because the building is not designed correctly into security. How on earth this is allowed to carry on is unbelievable.,1
Absolute worst airport I've never flown into. An hour delay for de-icing meant that the airport wasn't open when we landed. So the reroute to East Midlands pushed us back an additional 3 hours. We had the pleasure of taking a motor coach for the remained trip.,1
"Take off!!!   No, just a Rip off!!!

I have been through more airports than I can remember in more countries than I can remember and not once have I been charged to be dropped off, however this airport has certainly put itself on the map!  £3 to drop their own customers off and the same to pick them up!
In future i will advise my business associates to fly to and from other airports.
its' a miserable drab place anyway!!

Cass",1
"Flying out of this airport is an experience - not a good one. On 17.2.18 flew to Malaga with my husband. At security I said to the man at the belt that I was going to put my iPad mini in a separate box but he said to put it with my other stuff. Once through, as I was getting sorted I noticed my iPad was missing as was my perfume (in clear bag). I told the person who seemed to be in charge and she said she’d look through cctv. After a while she came out of her office and said that they couldn’t see me getting my iPad out of my bag - implication ??!! I was quite cross and told her I definitely had, so she said she’d have another look. As time passed, I remembered that the iPad had security and I could make it “scream” using my mobile. Amazingly 2 minutes later they found it in a box THAT THE SECURITY MAN HAD MOVED IT INTO.  The whole shambolic situation took nearly half an hour - good thing we had given ourselves plenty of time. The same security also insist each time on giving my husband who has 2 artificial knees and a recent triple heart bypass a physical pat down despite him going through their Scanner and being informed of his health issues. On a very positive note - the special assistance staff were all super fantastic.",1
"The worst airport in the UK so far. Long waiting queues, lack organisation, no information about fly delays.",1
"Ruined my elderly, non-english speaking mother's holidays. A minor ID issue (it was declared lost for two days, and found afterwards) was a sufficient reason to detain my mother. She did not know what was happening, as I was waiting her on the arrivals. The airport did not provide a translator, nor let me go with her.
When she got out the arrivals, I found her pale-white, only knowing a man has taken her ID card, and spoke some things in English in a rude tone. In her three-days holiday, we had to go to London from Hull at 5 am, spending two days there to get the safe-conduct, all for a minor burocratic issue.

Now I will have to wait a year to see her again, as we spended all the money buying a new flight ticket and rushing train tickets (500 pounds for a minor burocratic issue).",1
This place gets worse every time I visit it. I arrived home last night from Amsterdam and spent more time on the ground in Leeds waiting for the plane to be parked than I did in the air. Only two Swissair staff working apparently.,1
Absolute slum and owners and operators should be ashamed of it,1
"Not a great start / end to our holiday.
Free one hour drop off is a long walk to the terminal.. Especially with 2 young children and three suitcases. Paths not level. No defined route and lots of kerbs to negotiate. Add to this NO LUGGAGE TROLLIES AVAILABLE... makes it very difficult. Because on arrival you have to pay one pound or two euros for a trolly... Never had to pay for a trolly anywhere I've been.

I think you're forgetting you're an airport to service people not squeeze a pound here and there and forget about the people. (Priority drop off??)

Breakfast was expensive and poor.

Won't be back lba.
Sorry but You're putting families off traveling . Doncaster was much better.",1
"We flew first time with jet2 last week can't fault jet2 team on entire holiday they were all brilliant but security at this dirty smelly hole was disgraceful 2 hours queuing and if duty manager had not intervened we would have missed our flight
Never will I fly from there again",1
"Unfortunately, I am a regular passenger using Leeds Bradford airport. The security check-in has been made into an unnecessarily degrading experience; possibly the worst hurdle before your flight. Staff are surly, poorly trained and unhelpful. Don't waste your time making a formal complaint because the airport director's staff won't respond to it.",1
"So badly run ATM, going out we went two weeks before the school holiday, we flew with Easyjet and they had loads of staff but a little slow checking in tbh, then the pain begins two ques 1 for fast track and 1 for everyone else same for body scanners the one que for just fast track is rarely used so why is it so difficult for someone to use their brain and move the ques quicker when there is no one coming through fast track serve the general que and frustrated people's waiting needlessly, same for the body scanners and passport control, then upon our return on the Saturday the ques where horrendous the airport was stupidly busy, once we finally  got our cases we thought the massive ques inside the ques then ran along the outside of the building right to the carparks and can only think that its how the airport is currently being run.",1
"Living a bit closer to LBA than Manchester I thought I would give it a go.
Nothing works at this airport. Self serve check in and main check in systems down, card machines not working and to cap it parking is miles away and far too expensive.
Back to Manchester next time - no doubt about it",1
"New Yorkshire lounge is simply horrid. Cavernous, sparse and lit like a hospital waiting room. I hope it’s temporary because I can’t believe the new CEO of LBA would allow this effort to be permanent.
This airport seems destined to be an embarrassment of incompetence indefinitely.",1
"Dreadful airport, rude bus drivers, misleading parking signs, no one answers the intercom at the car park, security staff couldn’t be more miserable if they tried, passport check when you land here is a port a cabin that looks like a detention centre and the floor is dangerously slippery in baggage collection. I could go on!",1
"Terrible. Too small, too busy and slow",1
"Crazy parking prices, don't use the carpark to pick anyone up!",1
"Total craphole. This place is built with eateries in mind. There must be all of two maybe three gents/ladies toilets (dirty) always an unsatisfactory delay from landing to baggage reclaiming if you arrive after midnight because there is only a skeleton staff working and waits of 45 minutes are not unusual. Meanwhile, if you've got anyone collecting you outside who isn't savvy, the outrageous £3 soon jumps to £10",1
"Worst airport I have been on, horrible experience and at the end 6£ for 30 seconds drop off 🤦‍♂️",1
I have been forced to pay 39 pounds for the so called 1 hour free parking when being late 5min due to flight arriving late and slow border control. This is not right.,1
"Frequent traveller and I hate this place. Miserable staff, crap parking and cramped airport. Feel like I'm in a bus station. Needs knocking down and rebuilding! Whoever runs this airport needs to go visit Newcastle or London City to see how a real small airport works.",1
Slow moving on departures and arivals. Impossible to book a parking slot avoiding  parasite companies.,1
Poor and getting worse.  Gate 9 and 10 are a 250m walk down a leaking external link corridor.   LBA has grown tok quickly and doesn't cope with voljne of travellers.  Customer care us at best poor.,1
I object to have to pay £3 to do a drive through to drop somebody off. It's scandalous. If you park nearby to drop off the Police move you along. They even have a resident Police van sitting there just for that purpose. Don't they have anything better to do?  Really poor.,1
"It was horrendous, really long security queues with only one security station open, completely understaffed and then wanted to search lots of older woman after security after standing for over an hour... really bad experience.",1
"Small and cramped and not particularly clean. You're also charged £3 to drop someone off, that's the minimum charge to pull up outside the airport.",1
Horrific 2 and a half hour queue through security with little fresh air and no opportunity to sit ...loads of tired and cranky kids. Would think twice before flying out of Leeds ever again,1
"Let's start with security, ridiculous queues, significantly understaffed, cramped queuing area with no ventilation, terribly organised. Next came car parking, we parked in what was very clearly a marked bay and essentially had our car vandalised by the parking operatives with a stupid sticker, we made a complaint as per the Ts&Cs and were fobbed off by everyone from the parking manager through to the CEO, possibly the worst customer service I've ever experienced from every level of management.",1
"Couldn't find any toilets before passport control on arrival, then had to queue. Toilets and airport in general filthy. Not a good impression on landing in UK.",1
"Plane late departure due to airport security staffing issues , it seems to be the normal with LBA
NEEDS TO SORT IT - CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS DIMINISHING.",1
"The staff of the airport are absolutely indifferent, could not care less.
You will not get any help from them.",1
"No good.
They are misleading people.  They say everywhere in the airport that they provide free WIFI.  Why they don't say is that you have a register to a site, agree to provide your details and fill out a bloody survey for then only get 30 minutes of  so called ' free Internet'.

This practice should be reported to the authorities.  It should not be allowed.  I don't like it when  organisation treat people like that...",1
"This airport is the worst I've been to.  I never recommend anyone to come here, you will lose 5 hours of your life.",1
Access to airport is just unbelievable. It’s 21st century and you drive through some village roads to get to it🙈,1
"Very poor, an embarrassment to the north. Desperately needs a refurb.",1
"I am a regular traveller. The airport is clearly under resourced and as a result over stretched. My only contact with staff can, at best, be described as brusk! I'll put up with the drive to Stansted next time. Very disappointed.",1
Pick up and drop of parking a complete rip of shouldn't be aloud to charge that much to park for a couple of minutes charged me 7 pounds for no more than ten minutes obscene,1
"Avoid, avoid, avoid. 2 hours to get to security. 2 staff scanning passports. 10 flights departing in one hour on a Saturday. Horrendous",1
"Probably the worst airport in Europe, no rail links, it's in the wrong location, many cancelled flights due to the wind thanks to the altitude. Far too small for population it's supposed to serve.
East Leeds airport is where this should be.",1
£13 payment for parking for 15 mins .. when I had  read that you get an hour free,1
"Disgraceful attitude by security staff who seem to think they can be aggressive and speak like you are a criminal. The whole experience of this place feels like a zoo and we’re the animals, except that animals probably have a better time of it.",1
"When I arrived, you charged £3.00 for something, and £4.00 for parking, and you had to pay in the terminal, what a disgrace! You should clearly know what to do, LBA, just don't get us down.",1
Literally a shambolic nightmare. People waiting for ages to get stuff tested at security and no security people bothering to do anything. Felt like they were doing it on purpose. Completely disorganised and poor customer experience. Will use Manchester next time.,1
"Never seen an airport like it for a que for security. Avoid if you can, unless you enjoy standing in a que in which case this is the airport for you.",1
"Queue for security round the building and outside, nearly a 2hour wait at 5am in the morning! Get some staff or sort your scheduling out as it’s abysmal!",1
"No cover walk way from taxi drop off to airport ft door, got soaked",1
Very slow security and poor signage.  Over crowded in August.  Lack of bus for unloading passengers. A disgrace in modern UK. Avoid like the plague.,1
"The worst airport ever. Understaffed and disorganized, wait times are very long, mediocre facilities",1
Paking charges too high and clean air zone charges.  I wouldn't recommend it,1
Total rip off parking charges just for drop off and meet 🤬,1
"I have travelled all over the world (business and vacations) I have regularly used  LBA since 1985 Once it was ""cute"" but efficient Now its one of the worlds worst Reasons 1 Pay to drop off/collect 2 Congested bars/restaurants 3 Poor access to immigration 4 Airside escalator not working 5 Shocking immigration queues 6 Slow to get bags back
Only positive is Sentinel car park (not run by LBA of course)",1
Easily the worst airport in the UK. No air con & no decent food options.,1
"Nothing wrong with the airport,Arrow taxis 2 and a half hours wait ,shocking don't deserve the airport contract 😤",1

"Terrible, super caótico y con filas interminables. Si no llegas mas de tres horas antes es probable que pierdas el vuelo y el personal lo único que hace es decirte que compres el fast pass.

"Najgorsze lotnisku z jakiego latałem .Zgubili mi bagaż niby ktoś inny przez pomyłkę zabrał ,problem w tym że walizki były na taśmie nim przeszliśmy przez kontrolę paszportową więc każdy mógł zabrać co chciał .Obsługa lotniska w ogóle nie poczuwa się do błędu na odpowiedź Swiss port czekałem ponad 2 tygodnie w końcu odpisali że dopóki ta 2 osoba nie odda bagażu mają związane ręce parodia .Trzymajcie się z daleka od tego miejsca pełno pracowników z Bradford a wszyscy wiedzą kto tam mieszka i jakie mają standardy ......Tragedia",1
"Złodziejskie ceny za parking.

non positiva,1
"4am and there are queues and everyone seems under pressure and barking like market traders at the passengers. Checking in 4 flights all departing within 10 minutes of each other using only two scanners
No need for it. An occasional please after a barked direction might be nice.
I feel embarrassed as to what overseas visitors must make of the Yorkshire' main airports welcome
Not a nice way to start a birthday trip
I've never been checked into a prison but I image LBA baggage screening is what it's like",2
"I’ve traveled through LBA for many years and it has to be one of the most inefficient airports in the uk and Europe. Almost every time of landing there is an unacceptable delay in getting a shuttle bus to the terminal, which is made even worse due to the fact that the terminal entrance is usually less than  100 meters from the plane.
Passage through security is a lottery also.
Basically the airport is old and too small for the numbers of passengers it is trying to deal with.",2
"The security staff are renowned for their lack of courtesy and we were not disappointed. One guy barking orders to us had clearly had too many energy drinks, or worse and the rest just let him. The foods on offer doesn't know what heart healthy means",2
"Airport staff are rude. Security personnel were unnecessarily rude making us unpack all of our items into almost identical clear bags to what we brought. Limited to 1 bag per person.
Was quiet and seemed like they had nothing better to do.
Several security staff just stood around chatting and watching.
Airport is very dated and not very pleasant.
Staff in shops are equally rude, not a single person wished us a good flight or a nice trip. Totally rude and unfriendly.
Such a shame.",2
Very poor requires more staff with better  customer handling skills... The amount of walking required for disembarking from planes not acceptable all other services require updating. Used airport for many years nothing changed getting worse.,2
"The airport WiFi is useless, been travelling through LBA for quite some time now but never get access. In the 21st Century you would think this one, small detail could be sorted to help passengers.
Never an enjoyable experience but a necessary evil to go through this airport.",2
"I live close so it makes sense to use it sadly whilst the staff are usually fine border control and security are truly chaotic, under resourced
Minuscule  and stressful . The eating opportunities in the Saltire bar pretty much the same but expensive. I’m not happy with my comments but comparing this airport with others it like chalk and cheese",2
"Service at the airport by the staff there was spot on from reception at jet2 to security check in and a professional but very pleasant man called Craig Maguire.
Unfortunately this was let down by the bar staff at the Saltaire Bar - apparently you can be the only person stood waiting to be served and be completely ignored by the two staff who would rather collect glasses, do the  rubbish and chit-chat in the back room before coming out again, ignoring you again and the serve someone else who has just walked upto the bar AND don't even apologise for not seeing you  -  shocking and very slack and ignorant.",2
"Surprised by the inclement weather, the car park team were out in force clearing the unexpected snow so that the transfer bus from the car park could make it through. They showed good spirit. Arriving at the Ryanair automatic bag check-in service all the equipment was there and working but for newbies like myself it wasn't clear what to do. I couldn't see a sign so I asked a member of staff. It was simple once you know how, I  just needed the knowledge injecting in somehow! Security was slow and steady. Take a walking stick and a grey wig to receive pleasant priority treatment! The excellent prices on the duty free spirits took me back 40 years when duty free was worth having! Amazing! The departure lounge was horrific. Every seat was occupied upstairs. Downstairs was less busy but it was too cold to sit for more than a few minutes. Costa offered a saving grace with comfortable chairs free and good coffee to boot. Just as well as our flight was delayed by over 4 hours. There just weren't enough seats in the departure lounge. All were full and most of the bars an cafés were full too. 2 hours later it was much better. Then off to the boarding lounge where there were only a few seats. Then the ""priority passengers"" were let out onto the tarmac for an avoidable 10 minute dousing in snow. Sorry about the negative bits!",2
"The combustion of 1 kilogram (kg) of jet fuel in an aircraft engine produces 3.16 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the volume released per flight is based on a number of factors such as aircraft efficiency and maintenance, distance travelled, the load carried (passengers and cargo), and weather conditions.Carbon monoxide is a poisonous, flammable gas that is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and slightly less dense than air. Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom connected by a triple bond. It is the simplest carbon oxide. In coordination complexes, the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl.",2
Very poorly organised we have had 2 recent flights to Leeds Bradford and both times sat on the run way for around 30 minutes first time waiting for buses to transport to the terminal second time was waiting 25 minutes for stairs to get off the plane. From touching down to border control was 1 hour and 10 minutes,2
Took my money through security their very nosey but great airport without people who work there comfy seats snd all was good during flights,2
No trolleys in meet and greet car park. Fast Track security meant nothing with regular pax being pushed in front of us. Total chaos in security meant I misplaced my wallet which was fortunately handed in. Terrible experience.,2
"Tell me about LBA being an INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT !!! Queues for check-in crossing and getting totally disorganised. Car rental agencies closing at 16:00 on Saturday and opening at 11:30 on Sunday ! Plus I dropped somebody at the drop-off today and it cost me 6£ for… 2 min ! If they continue like then more people are going to go to MAN I’m afraid. Please Airport Management, can you think of the passengers ?",2
"The only thing going for this airport is its close proximity to my home. Run down, disgusting toilets, regular long queues for security, average facilities, some basic gates but mostly friendly staff.",2
"Gave it a go, usually go to Manchester. How can you have an international airport with such awful transport options. The streets to the airport, (not motorways or dual carriageways) are not capable to make driving an option but there is no other choice.
It took 45 mins to drive 5 miles through rawdon. The duty free and other facilities are fine but it was still cramped with little seating. You then have to walk outside in what I can only describe as bus shelters end on end to get to your plane and if your lucky you get a portacabin to stand in. After coming from Poland it makes England look like it's in the 1950s.",2
"It's convenient not having to travel to Manchester all the time, BUT this airport is small, too small, especially for the amount of travellers, this airport its claustrophobic. We struggled to find seats or anywhere to eat waiting for our flight. Worse was arriving home at 3am with an extremely small baggage reclaim area and waiting long periods for cases with a mounting number of flights. People were constantly asked to move by border police but overcrowding was a real problem. The security waits have improved though. Calling it an international airport is maybe a bit too ambitious. Parking and charges are scandalous even if they are aligned with other airports. One plus was the Jet2 checking in area with Staff being friendly and helpful.",2
"Appalling getting through security, 2 people on, only 2 scanners on, people queuing for ages, took 50 minutes to get through. It's a great little airport, but it really needs sorting out!",2
"Stuck in 1970 still, facilities are all really outdated and in dire need of a refurbishment when you compare it with just about any comparable sized airport in Europe. Staff pleasant and waiting time for security were both decent though",2
"Not fit for purpose. Overcrowded. Had to walk through long, cold cattle run to board plane.  No protection from rain & wind. Knock it down & rebuild in a better location!!",2
"Departures and check in was quick and easy. But the food/drinks area is small and over crowded. Very strange layout which feels quite dark and dingey. Duty free is tiny so don’t plan on getting anything special. Boarding was smooth and quick.
However arrivals was awful, not enough room for everyone even in the early hours at security and bag collection was atrocious, cramped and quite dangerous as people reaching over each other to try to spot their cases!
Word of warning book the more expensive parking as trying to get on and off the shuttle bus was a nightmare, giant jenga with people and cases (the last thing you need at 3:30am). Cattle have a better journey than this",2
"Staff are friendly enough, but the problems start past security when there is an astounding lack of seating areas if you don’t want to sit at a bar for 2hrs before your flight! Not many places to shop or grab a bite, mostly bars. Many drunken passengers, so much so that one chap was arrested straight off of our flight to Chania. Overall a very cramped, uncomfortable airport; I will endeavour to use Newcastle or Manchester for future flights!",2
Too small for the amount of passengers. I travelled in May and luckily were in a lounge so was gaurenteed a seat. Went again in July and was no areas to sit. The bars were completely overflowing with intimidating drunk people. I love a drink but in a pub or club not a general departure lounge. Elderly and family's having nowhere to sit apart from the floor. They need to extend the terminal building or cut the number of flights. Only positive was took around 20 minutes from landing to getting on bus to car park.,2
"Whilst I appreciate that the smell from the salubrious confines of toilets is a freshing ""welcome to England, this is what all public gents smell like"", I found the irksome price of £7.49 for a pint of beer a bigger ""you're not welcome here foreign pig"" than Brexit. And I'm not even foreign.

I also found the inability of the airport to decide which city it is in worrying. This must be a terrible stress on the pilots who already have a difficult job of flying whilst inebriated.",2
"The airport is poorly maintained. The security desk was well organised by a supervisor, but poorly handled by the staff behind each table. The toilets are dirty, with no toiletpaper, nor soap. Not enough seats, no air conditioning, the pubs had only few free tables and those haven't been cleared or cleaned. It's a shame some flights from Doncaster were moved here. The services are really poor compared to Doncaster Airport.",2
The airport itself is small but does what it's there for. The big negative is the £6 fee for dropping off or picking up. If your tearful farewell lasts 10 minutes it goes up to £8. Thievery.,2
"Signage isn't the best for drop-off or pick-up (especially in the dark). 2 minutes drop off is £6 which is extortionate, and the reason why you see people walking on roads with poor lightning and no pavement with suitcases. It is time to review this before an accident occurs.",2
"Would benefit from better cleaning, more seating or eateries and public transport links.

They now charge £6 just to be picked up, unless you want to walk miles.",2
"Very annoying staff!!!
They delayed us in queue just to check in our bags no one was kind or sensible enough to tell us what was going on. Imagine staying in line for so long without knowing why or when it will end.
It’s my first time in Leeds Bradford airport and most likely the last time…",2
Staff very professional but I found it scruffy and I think it needs a good clean/makeover. Also the prices are way too high in the resteraunt so ended up getting a sandwich from whsmiths which is far better than the food served in the airport. Alas i hope it improves?,2
No air conditioner the airport is too hot.... Dirty the toilets on 17 Sept at 19pm was just unbelievable dirty  is third time in this airport and for sure the last because always flights late and no conditions to stay there 6 hours in this atmosphere,2
"6 pounds to get dropped off! What a rip off. Get that sorted out L&B....you should be ashamed of yourselves.
30 odd minutes waiting in the Q for security....what a joke! Have a business Q and Holiday makes Q. Not difficult.
Staff friendly enough.
Still alot of room for improvement.",2
All good until you go to the bar £7.50 a pint is really taking advantage. Charge less sell more it's not hard.,2
"First time flying from Leeds and it will be my last. Slow access to airport, over priced car parking, slow security, dirty, lack of seating, overcrowded, and staff that didn’t seem to care if you weren’t happy. The one positive was the Jet2 checking in bit on arrival which was seemless.",2
"45 minutes queue for security
25 minutes queue outside to get on the plane then 60 minutes on the plane before take off. Come back Doncaster Sheffield Airport",2
"The A1'flyer'  bus service is appalling and can't be relied on. Today at the airport passengers were waiting for over an hour for what's supposed to be a 20min frequency service. The 13:50 didn't turn up, the 14:10 didn't turn up, the 14:30 didn't turn up and the 1450 turned up late. People aren't going to use the airport without reliable transport links.",2
"Security very quick however as soon as through the board said ""go to gate"" and so no time to go to the toilet or buy food. Got to the gate and a very unenthusiastic Swiss port member of staff scanned everyone in where we waited for 45 minutes to board. No seats or toilet, when asked he said you can use the toilet on the plane (which hadn't even landed in Leeds yet). Surely the airport businesses are losing all the sales because of this overly early boarding",2
One desk open for visa check. Absolutely ridiculous. 50 minutes and counting,2
"The best place at this airport is the car park, which allows you to take advantage of 1 hour of free parking.  That's where the benefits of this mess end.  As for the organization of people serving the airport, unfortunately, I have nothing nice to add.  I've used it three times over the past 2 years and it's probably enough.  The last flight on Monday was delayed again - not the fault of the staff but because of the plane's delay.  The monitors did not display the gate, travelers found out from which gate through the airline's applications (Ryanair).  The airport staff, even after boarding the passengers, asked if everyone present on the plane was definitely going to Poznań.  If someone is flying to Malaga, has to leave the plane.  Shocking.",2
"Like many small provincial airports, Leeds Bradford is conveniently located but lacks the organisation of larger airports - we had a really poor experience both departing and arriving.

On departure, once past security the situation was absolutely horrendous. I’ve never seen an airport so overcrowded. And this was a normal June Saturday, not with any particular issues. It was impossible to get food or drink except from Smiths due to mega queues. Then, presumably because of the overcrowding, we were processed through the gate and had to wait, standing outside, for 45 minutes to board the plane!

On arrival, we had to wait an hour for the bags from our plane to arrive in the baggage claim. No information was offered - in fact, no one at all from Swissport, the handlers, was in the baggage claim hall. Our case was missing so we had to walk all the way to the check-in hall to report this. When we got there, the Swissport supervisor was dismissive and unhelpful, and then actively rude when I complained about our wait and his unhelpfulness. He actually said ‘I don’t like your attitude’ to me!! I was astonished. He then walked away out of the building while I was talking to him.

Next time, I will drive the extra half hour to Manchester, a proper international hub instead of this toy airport.",2
Used car drop off. Was there less than 3 minutes and had to pay the minimum charge of £6. Absolute rip off. Other airports I have used ( eg Humberside  ) allow free parking for pick up and meet+greet.,2
Only two security lanes. It's clearly not enough for departures. There was a long delay over the weekend and on Monday morning. The delays reported on the Web site were inaccurate. It was an unpleasant experience leaving from there.,2
"A mixed experience really , the Jet2 staff are exceptional,  very well organised and helpful
The rest of the airport, which we use st least twice a year , has issues
Firstly with so many flights leaving so early in the morning the number of travellers is so high and there is nowhere near enough seating or resting space
But my main issue is the Baggage reclaim, this must be among the worst anywhere I can think of
Twice this year we have arrived back in the early hours, cleared passport control and then had to wait well over a further 30 minutes before any baggage comes through,  just as a comparison when we arrived at our destination earlier last week the baggage was already coming through by the time we got to the carousel
It's not good enough Leeds ,especially when trying to upgrade the airport",2
"One of the worst airports I have been to.
Security control queue is a mess. The security check itself is fine but the queue goes through a narrow hallway where you’ll be cramped with tons of other people.
There are no boarding pass scanning gates, it’s performed by the personnel which further slows the process.
Then the after-security area is a mess. The way the whole terminal is mapped makes close to no sense at all and makes you change levels for no apparent reason.
Oh and the info prompts are weirdly situated making you look for your flight info. Cherry
on the cake the gate for my flight got displayed 10 minutes AFTER gate closure time. The app knew the gate but not the airport.",2
"Far too small to provide a great service. Never any seats to sit on. Queues to get into eating areas, noisy, too warm a nd far too crowded. Needs a shed load of investment to make it a hlf decent airport.",2
We’ve always used this airport as its the closest to us and we use Jet 2 a lot. Year on year it just seems to be going down and down. We landed yesterday after 18 nights in Malaga and it was like arriving in a third world country. This airport now is just not fit for purpose. I thought there’d been millions spent on it but I honestly can’t see where. It’s shabby and dirty without enough seating. The toilet facilities are disgusting. Arriving at Malaga Airport was a lovely experience. Big open spaces that were absolutely spotless. The total opposite of LBA. What first impressions visitors from abroad have I can’t imagine. Going to try and use Newcastle in future.,2
Poor level of service. Long queue on arrival at passport control. Toilets not very clean and small. WiFi not working.  Noisy. Long walk in the cold to get on board and no pier to the airplane,2
"Absolute shambles,  Jet2 check in only 3 of 15 check in desks manned, same short staffed area in security..only just made it to plane in time after arriving at airport 2hrs before flight.",2
"Going through security is chaos.Lots if people shouting instructions at you making it feel even more chaotic.
Toilets always dirty. Not enough seating areas at busy times and overall never a good experience",2
"Far too many flights for the airport to manage. Ridiculous queue's everywhere. Shops without stock. Nowhere to sit, eat, drink, rest. It can't manage the number of flights",2
We had to wait on our plane 🙄 for half an hour while we waited for the ground team to get a bus for us to travel a hundred metres. Not what you need when you've been travelling over half a day. 🙄,2
"All airport staff lovely, helpful and calm considering the stress they must be feeling right now. No security queue but have been sat on the plane for one hour waiting for ground crew to unload previous flight's luggage and load ours. Not the crew's fault... in fact its a ridiculous ask for so few people. Can't fault KLM... communications is excellent. Captain talking to everyone. Lots of concern about connecting flights. Want to give 5 stars for the staff but going for 2 in the hope that management help them out.",2
Gents toilet in arrivals DISGUSTING Malaga airport put yours to shame.,2
"3 stars because Airport is small and convenient, easy to get to gates and has boots which offers items/food at an ok price like for an airport. Ridiculous car park prices fair enough there is 1h free car park but at least make 10min free drop off and pick up.
Security staff ok their uniforms doesn’t make them look smart as it would be expected from Airport security. Last thing is the terrible baggage reclaim area 😂 the baggage reclaim is making so much noise my ears hurt 😢 and when the shutter raises makes a noise like from horror. Staff very nice and polite not the duty free staff they look at you like an old security system.
I like LBA as it has many connections and it’s small. Bad points expensive car park long stay as short stay, hard to get to, no train access expensive taxis because if you want to get a taxi order than the airports you have to walk miles where they can actually pick you up from without paying fines.

Thank you",2
"Feels more like a 1970's bus station. We arrived internationally on a parking stand that was a significant distance from the terminal, no support available for families with young children to walk over a kilometre to the overcrowded baggage reclaim which had a lack of serviceable trollies. Definitely not a great customer experience.",2
"One of the worst airports I've visited in my whole life. Very crowdy and small, dirty everywhere on floor and public wifi don't connect even after trying more 5 times.",2
"Same old story check in and security was fine. But unfortunately once your through they don't have the facilities for large number of passengers. Absolutely no we're to sit all the bars and restaurants full, so we were left standing for nearly 2 hours",2
"The terminal is far from the drop off. There were lots of confused passengers due to works inside. Two or three flights being checked in from one desk and no priority queue. Long waiting time (outside in a minus temperature with two small children) before being let into the plane (and again, no priority). We used Doncaster Airport for years and had no experience like that to be honest.",2
"Bag drop late opening, security queue very large and slow - only 2 staff working. Usual old question when paying for goods- do you have an English note? Please educate your staff - Northern Irish bank notes state that they are sterling - English bank notes don't.  Republic of Ireland use Euros. Quite simple.",2
"Awful, just awful

We flew on Sunday, 6th March 2022, our airline, Jet2 was excellent, friendly an efficient. We arrived really early, as always,.
After that the experience was dreadful.
The queue to security was horrendous, a triple zigzag  queue before you even got into the security hall.  After an hour I needed the toilet so I had to push and shove, excuse-me wasn't sufficient to get there and back.  Earlier flights were asked to go to the fast track, putting us further behind.  Just as we got to the head of the queue our flight was fast tracked!
The usual, more efficient, method of double stacking people at the security stations was not applied; it was chaos.
As for how the rest of the airside facilities were?  No idea - we had to go straight to the gate.  Jet2 then took over - they were first class.
On our return three weeks later we were put on a bus.  Our bus didn't set off for 15 minutes after the one parked in front; in spite of being first off the aircraft we were net with a queue in the immigration hall.
If they want to be a true international airport they really need to get their act together.",2
"My advice
Get there early , very long queue on Friday 16th September at 5.30am. Lack of staff at Jet2 check in, only 3 members of Staff checking clients in.
Then the queue for security check in was over an hour even the same for fast track.
Its poor organisation and Lack of staff,  at the end of the day they know weeks in advance what the passenger numbers are.
I  hope they take positive action to resolve this problem.
Everything else was acceptable.
Happy flying folks",2
"Had an early Sunday morning flight. After passing through security the departure lounge was rammed full of people. As a consequence, it was hot with queues of people everywhere waiting for food and flights. There were no significant flight delays however the airport doesn’t seem to be designed to cope with so many people departures. Not a pleasant experience.",2
"Poor ,for seating flew on a Friday afternoon had to sit on the floor. Return also poor only two flights to unload,took 30 mins for bags to appear on the baggage conveyor,bags were mixed for both flight's. Conveyors are  so short that it creates a deep crowd around it with people struggling to get in to get to there cases.",2
"I've been to worse service stations in my life.

The highlights:
The delay to our flight that allowed us to stay even longer.
The security staff having a non-uniform day.
All the tables at the restaurants having lots of free food left by previous diners.
Every surface being so sticky, it made the menus so much easier to grab.

All in all the staff were all very friendly and trying their best. Senior management really need to sort out the obvious and grime inducing lack of staffing.",2
"So I arrived at the airport early...as expected from a traveller...

Can not check in yet so have to wait

Now comes the 2-star review!

This place feels like being in a tunnel !

The draft makes the dust turn into tumbleweeds of duston the ground !

Not good !",2
"Walking from free carpark is extremely dangerous, and could  cause injury on the uneven surface.",2
Very little seats to wait at gates. Focus on bars food and shops. Tired and dirty,2
"Feels like one long maze of narrow corridors- no open space anywhere, very claustrophobic, with long queues and too many people for the actual space of the airport. Special assistance was challenging as we were given inconsistent advice from staff at different stages of the airport. Special assistance should really be offered pre-check-in due to the vast length of the queues.",2
No proper waiting areas landside. Why do they have only metal seats? Very uncomfortable airport. From short stay car park (badly maintained btw) there is no clear signage to walk to terminal. Difficult specially in the dark. And no charging ports :(,2
Its possible to find a seat in LBA but that's the best that can be said of the place. It's not quite as 'grabbing' as Manchester airport but it seems to wish it was i.e. It's all about sell sell sell & herd the numbers (people ) through & screw them for everything possible!!! Ugly business,2
"One of the worst airports I've visited in my whole life. Very crowdy and small, dirty everywhere on floor and public wifi don't connect even after trying more 5 times.",2
Great location for Yorkshire but the airport is now becoming outdated and struggles to keep up with demand. There are often very long queues for both departure and arrival. There are no electronic passport gates. Staff are friendly and helpful but feel very thin on the ground. It ideally needs some investment putting into it and  more staff and equipment to assist with security checks and passport control.,2
A joke of an airport.  Charging £5 for an Uber drop off but no facility to add to your fare.  So you get dropped off well outside the airport due to red lines.   Only plus side was no queues at security.   Overall best to train direct to Manchester.,2
"Ridiculously long security line. Only one counter open to get through. Understaffed. We smartly paid for fast track for 5 euros and saved our flight. I was randomly flagged for additional security. Fine. But - and this is the first time I’ve seen this in the 300-400 flights I’ve taken across the world - the check consisted of literally unpacking my carry on and putting all the contents on a dirty plastic tray and running it through again. I didn’t have electronics or liquids. Nothing that would have been a red flag. It was swabbed for explosives as wel, which again, is standard random procedure that I’m okay with, but why focus on unpacking my carry on just to run it through the same scanner on the same tray when nothing is suspicious. Literally never seen that before anywhere. Who thought up that policy, because it must be specific to this leeds airport. Obviously they don’t travel much. Moronic. How about focus on your insane lines and dedicate any available staff to opening up a second security counter. Common sense!?",2
"Avoid if you can. Flying out was ok. Coming back was another nightmare. I'd booked special assistance,  didn't get it on way back. Had to walk, my mum, who required a wheelchair couldn't walk so we were at the back as she needed to take rest. Rang the special assistance number on their phone, no answer so carried on. The staff responsible for locking up behind us huffing and puffing, told him she's not well and there was no answer on the phone, got a sarcastic reply 'did you not' so I said no we didn't. Anyway... only go if you're fit and well. Highly disappointed with the lack of facility and unfriendly.",2
"Security is a bit of a mess - bad layout where people have to put items in trays and queue up for security scan.

Food court was a disaster, tables left uncleaned for hours, generally unclean.

Once you get past Duty Free, it's more claustrophobic than a London Tube station, and seating is almost non-existent outside of the restaurant areas.

Outbound flight was delayed 2 hours due to shortage of ground staff.

Wouldn't be in a rush to fly out of here again.. literally 🙄",2
"Very long queues for security, Fastrack worth every penny. Everywhere very busy, paid £60 for two of us to use one of the lounges. Not overly impressed, food selection very mediocre, no toilets at the lounge. Airport toilets dreadful, five cubicles, one out of order, one no toilet roll, one so disgusting nobody brave or stupid enough to use it, leaving only two. Unfortunately one of them appeared to be occupied by a corpse judging by the time they were in there so effectively only one available. Overall a pretty grim experience using this Airport. On a positive note the staff appeared pleasant considering the difficult conditions they were having to cope with.",2
As usual there was very large queue to get through security control checks. They seem to have no idea how to cope with a large number of flights and passengers needing to get through in a short space of time. Too many flights and not enough staff to cope with the situation.,2
"Awful,late night flight then kept waiting for a bus to the terminal, bus arrived loaded then waiting again to get going, since the loss of Doncaster you would think LBA would up their game",2
"Having travelled from LBIA for many years, I despair that fewer and fewer destinations are available ( just lost AGAIN the link to Heathrow) and the ‘restructuring’ of the airport has actually made the experience worse. We used to travel to Algarve in winter by Monarch but, when they collapsed, no airline stepped in…..presumably because LBIA is an unattractive proposition…Monarch planes were about 2/3 full in January ! The security process is a mess - little organisation, still short staffed and far too long a process. There are departure gates which, after more than a decade, you still have to walk seemingly miles along a ‘temporary’ outdoor covered path before alighting into a ‘departure hall’ accommodated in a portacabin - it’s archaic. No wonder ut’s rated 2nd worst airport in the UK - it’s very poorly managed.",2
"Paid for fast track but not needed as flew though security, possibly due to either time of flight or kids back to school? Win Win?

The Duty free didn't really have anything to offer, possibly more expensive than Tesco or the like (i.e Woodford Reserve Bourbon £34.99, Tesco price anything between £25 - £32).

The food at the Saltaire was what I would describe as canteen food but edible.

Over all a ""Meh"" experience, Will try another airport to broaden my experiences.",2
"Check in displays showed the wrong airlines, so at least two airlines were queuing in the wrong place and had to swap.

The crew working the desk had a guy being trained by somebody who didn't seem to know what they were doing anyway. They had to call somebody over to check me in. Three people to check in a passenger!
I got a lecture on how it would have been better if I had checked in online - despite me opening with the fact that the website wouldn't let me check in online which is why I was there in the first place.

To put the icing on the cake, Security was possibly the most disorganized I've ever seen it despite relatively low passenger numbers at the time.
I'd hate to be there when it's busy...",2
"Departure is pretty smooth, but jesus christ arrivals is a poopshow. No proper queuing for passport control, baggage collection is a nightmare with no proper signage and transfer buses are few and far between for the long stay car park, again there is no proper signage for where the bus picks up.",2
"Not a great airport by any stretch of the imagination! They are doing improvement work on it, but it really needs a complete rethink.

The journey through for the outbound flight was problem free, but it just the lack of facilities that make this a disappointing experience. Eating breakfast that cost approx £30 at a table that is designed to move around, making it impossible for two to sit and eat at and not much better for one person. After waiting nearly 20 minutes to be served any table was going to be welcomed.

The usual journey to the plane is down a seemingly never ending windy walkway, followed by standing around waiting while they finish servicing the plane. Perhaps we could have waited inside for a little longer!

Coming back is where the problems started. Once again parked on a stand in a different county, with miles to walk. Jet2 I though this was one of your big hubs, why do you have such poor stand locations? However I could cope with the walk if when you arrived there the baggage was going to appear. We landed at 2101 and we finally got baggage at 2212, with the excuse that we’re busy. You know when the planes are coming, why not make sure you’ve got staff.

The only reason I ever use this airport is that it’s 50 minutes from home, which is strangely quicker than the baggage system.",2
"Jet 2 brilliant but arriving back to Leeds was big let done, a very long walk to passport control and picking suitcases up was chaotic.",2
"Queued for 2.5 hours on 31st May for our flight to Croatia and eventually got fast tracked to gate just in time for take-off. Chaotic and unorganised, but it did look like senior management we're pitching in to help with the current staffing crisis, and other staff were pleasant and helpful.
On our return from our holiday, it was evident that LBA arrivals is a disgusting, filthy mess. Transfer buses were old and unclean, massive cob webs in the corridor leading to passport control, dirty stair wells, and it looked tired and in need of a massive overhaul. Shame.",2
"Update: changing to two stars, having now experienced Manchester airport which is even worse

This is a poor excuse for an airport. I think it was recently voted the worst in the UK. Well deserved. We've used the airport twice and each time the waiting times were atrocious - and that's for departures and arrivals, and flight delays.",2
"Badly organised from start to finish. Security queue like being at Alton Towers. Toilets on the way to security badly in need of a clean and toilet paper so thin it just falls apart when you try to pull some off the roll. Not enough general seating and must have had to walk several hundred yards along the outside corridor to board the plane, which was an hour behind schedule. On our return to Leeds Bradford we were met with a bus to take us to the terminal building, which is a first for us as we usually have a trek across the tarmac. No glamorous entrance hall as at Faro but the usual pokey back door which looks like a service entrance. One escalator, which was not working. Passport control better than usual as they had several members of staff on duty and we were some of the first people to get off the bus. Luggage came through fairly quickly so a fairly good ending to the holiday.  Leeds Bradford just does not match the luxury and spaciousness at Faro.  If we didn’t live so close to Leeds Bradford we would definitely find an alternative airport.",2
Unpleasant experience standing in a queue for over 2hrs to get through security. Staff were friendly and helpful but visibly under a lot of pressure. The airport really needs to get the situation sorted.,2
Awful airport. Definitely lacking in investment and extra cleaning. Having said that they only made £11.7 million in the year to march. 😳,2
"Definitely needs some improvements and renewal. It's too small for the area it serves. Always long queues for the security and passport control checks. Toilets are in terrible condition. I have used this airport for about 10 years now, and it's been under some work for all of this time with no significant improvement to be seen.",2
"The airport which at one time was very good has now become very tired and needs a complete refurbishment. I used to like flying from Leeds but I am now going to look elsewhere. I flew from there on Thursday 30th June and flew back on the 3rd July and the place was filthy and there was very few staff around to query. Why did the moaners and groaners put a stop to redevelopment, it needs it badly.",2
"The dirtiest airport I’ve ever been to! Staff isn’t friendly at all!

Parking is £13/hour and droop off £6 for 2 minutes. Ridiculous.",2
"Smaller airport, quick through security to your gate however very poorly sign posted car parks and expensive parking. Not much once you've gotten past security.",2
"Outbound, the experience through security was frantic with border staff barking instructions at travellers. It seemed unnecessary and at points rude. Inbound was however a better experience l.",2
"Only dropped the wife off. Cost £5 to literally walk her to the gate then walk back to the car! Ridiculous!!!
Airport is great though.
Still £5 for literally no time at all in the drop off carpark! First 15 minutes should be free.",2
"Had to travel there in the dark to pick our daughter up. Once you are off the motorway, the signage for the airport is not sufficient or of good quality. You have to travel through 10 miles of town/urban areas to get to the airport making it extremely stressful to find especially with trainee Sterling Moss's tailgating. Then the airport itself....having never been there before, I found signage for the ""free parking"" inadequate. So much so that I took the wrong turn and ended up in the ""drop off pick up area"" attracting an unnecessary cost of ££11. Not a great experience! Perhaps someone ""in power"" will act on this and make improvements? I won't hold my breath!!!",2
This place needs a refurb dirty toilets broken seats over run eating areas quality of food is less than adequate at hiked prices.take a look at the airports through Europe and get your act together . It’s a first impression of people visiting the UK,2
Not great. It a bit grotty. They could do with spending some money to make it a bit nicer,2
"The taxi company based here is an absolute joke..no taxis available for an hour this is the last 2 times I have landed. It is not good enough as every other airport I have visited have taxis. The management need to sort this out, it's faster to travel back from Manchester to Leeds..useless.",2
If you’re after microwaved food and non existent service with your overpriced food then this is the airport for you. Very claustrophobic airport once past security.,2
"Um, it's an airport and has all the things you'd expect: runway, aeroplanes, overpriced car parking, laughable drop off charge, comedic trolley charge, endless queues and eye-watering cafe and bar prices. To be fair, the queues aren't usually that bad but the last time there were 2 normal security channels and 2 ""fast track"" turning ""arrived in good time"" to ""I'm going to have to pay for fast track to avoid missing my flight"". Nice little earner at £4 a pop. To it's credit it's not in Manchester so coming from Leeds, there's no chance of getting stuck on the M62 for 3 days.",2
"I think it's one of the most horrible airports in Europe. Smelly and dirty everywhere, not helpful staff. Looks very old and tired... Flying from here beacause I have too...",2
Getting dated now. Not a modern airport and little to keep travellers entertained while waiting. The massive bus shelter to the furthest gates is an embarrassment especially gates 9 and 10 where you board via a portakabin. All parking options compromised too.,2
"Travelled from here many times. Over the last couple of years it has become noticeable that the cleanliness,efficiency and lack of management has really deteriorated. The cafe areas are extremely dirty as are the toilets. The places are overcrowded even on first flight out.  They should take a look at some of the other European airports and see how they function. However, Jet2 service always outstanding, just a shame airport let's it down.",2
"Leeds Airport seems have forgotten how to deal with flights and passengers. The free parking was closed due to ""full parking"", but inside there were still at least 20 free spots. The queue for check in was shambolic, and there was not enough personnel at the security check which took ages with only one x-ray machine open.",2
"The arrivals experience was not good today, stuck for 10 mins in the bridge getting off the plane, baggage collection was crazy. Arrived in baggage collection, all belts had flights our belt had three flights, bags were already piling up and all over the floor with passengers clearing most of a blockage, an airport baggage handler arrived and cleared the rest, the belt was started and stopped twice again, took about another 30mins for our bags to arrive. Leeds Bradford management need to get this area expanded and brought into something fit for purpose.",2
As is often the case 15/20 mins sat on plane waiting for bus. Then passport control too small when two planes land at once. 58mins from touchdown to taxi is ridiculous and that with just hand luggage.,2
"Passing through security last Friday afternoon, which was not busy, was the worst experience of passing security ever at LB Airport .The staff who looked unbelievably scruffy  were uncivil looked thoroughly fed-up.I suggest an effort is made not only to clean up the staff but  the  trays in which passengers have to place their belongings,they are filthy.  I felt embarrassed  as to the impression foreign travellers must get of this country. This was over-emphasised by other airports we fly  to where mainly the staff are clean very helpful and   pleasant.
I found the JET 2 reception was friendly the staff through the airport  were generally helpful and polite.",2
"A handy airport for Yorkshire, the jet 2 check in is efficient.  Always long queues at secrurity going out and have never been on a flight that took off on the stated time.  The drop off area is chaos at most times and you pay 3 pounds for the privilege.
No free water fountain once inside but plenty of Harrogate spa water for a couple of quid a bottle.  On the way back the luggage reclaim area will test the patience of each and every traveler as it hasnt been updated since the 1980s.  On the plus side the border staff are always pleasant and efficient regardless of the time of night you arrive and jet 2 staff are friendly.  Overall the airport has the ability to destroy your good will, excitement and if you let it your soul on the way to and back from your holiday,. Spend the extra time and money and go-to Manchester.",2
"On journey out, checkin computers all crashed, so took an age to drop bags off. On our return, no ground staff to get off the plane. Hopefully they'll sort their staffing and computer system issues out",2
"When we arrived we did not receive our luggage - which can happen and it's not the fault of the airport. But as we spoke to the responsible person he didn't give us any information but a card with a wrong tel. number. So we had to find it ourselves which took hours.
Also the airport is not very clean, especially the toilettes there are really horrible.",2
90 minutes to get through security resulting in no time to shop or have breakfast.  Knock on impact was no business for the franchise holders within the airport and no breakfast on the flight because they ran out of food due to increased demand. Rushed straight onto a plane. No way to start a holiday ! Security is a shambles at LBA.,2
"Not too bad getting through security was a bit of a drag - suppose the Brexit halfwits a lot to blame for that!
Through security was not particularly pleasant!! Too warm too few seats and little or no air conditioning.",2
Waited 30 minutes on the aircraft this morning for ground staff to bring rear steps. Didn't come so everyone had to use the front door.  Airport facilities and vehicles are looking tired and in need of a major upgrade.  It's embarrassing to arrive from Europe into LBA.,2
"Really expensive dropping off fee. No covered walkway so for £5 you get the privilege of walking 100 yards in the rain. Remember this is the highest airport in UK with weather to match.
For persons in wheelchairs they leave you downstairs where nothing is open. No refreshments etc and even the toilets are closed.",2
"The wait at the bag check-in was long despite the self-service scales. The security control is nothing short of a joke, with one of the two queues going to a single stand, while the other had 3 available. The layout of the area makes it barely possible to go though the process in a dignified manner.",2
"Great airport but £5 for someone to drop you off without getting drenched is an absolute scam, shouldn't cost a thing for the sake of 30 seconds",2
"It's a pity that Leeds Bradford Airport is my local airport as it is poor from start to finish . They have had so long to prepare for post covid travel and have failed at every turn . International Airport  , don't make me laugh  . Walking too and from your plane . I arrived this weekend and had to wait on the plane while a domestic flight was being loaded . Shame on you ceo",2
"Check-in fine and security pretty efficient, given how small the space is. But airside....wow....the worst I've seen. Far too small for the number of people going through (not helped by channeling everyone through a narrow space in duty free), food extortionate for really poor quality (£9 for breakfast sandwich with cheap bread and under-cooked egg), dirty tables stacked with plates.
I line 15 minutes, so really handy, but I'm not sure I want to use it again. Really poor experience.",2
Terrible experience. Herded like cattle onto plane and coming back was awful. 3 planes shared the baggage carousel & huge passport queue( no automation),2
"Flying with jet2, their book in system was amazing. All downhill from there. Getting to security and then departures an absolute joke! Two blokes checking in everyone. People queueing out the main entrance onto the carpark ! #employmorestaff",2
"Pokey airport with very poor signage for arriving travellers. Few facilities land-side with an impression of a cramped council bus station. If you're going to advertise yourself as Yorkshire's Airport the county deserves better than this! Do the management ever read reviews/consult customers? Poor show. Only upside (hence 2 stars) is the one hour free parking, though don't over stay as they'll charge you thirty quid!",2
"very dirty, very crowded and without any place to comfortably wait for your flight. reason i gave 2 stars was a very nice airport-staff man who helped me with orienting myself on the airport",2
"The staff are great, but this is definitely not the best airport to fly from. It shouldn't take an hour to go through security at 5am. Everything is disorganised.",2
"Worst taxi service through monopoly with Arrow. Often waiting times of 25 to 45 minutes for a taxi because they can not cope with demand. Absolutely diabolical. When will the airport appoint a better equipped taxi company or open it up to competition?
""Yorkshire's Airport"" in need of investments as now a Mickey Mouse airport with limited amamenities, destinations and number of flights. Washroom facilities need updating and improving.",2
"If your a family with small children and choose mid stay parking be aware.
It's a nightmare  to navigate and push cases towards/from terminal with the struggle of safely getting your young ones either way.
Uneven surface ramps that are totally useless as you get caught on them especially when pulling cases on a trolley.
Definitely won't be choosing this overpriced option again as clearly resurfacing isint an option.
And as for the pedestrian pathway good luck with this narrow option with cars usually encroaching them.",2
"The departure lounge area is very congested. We had to walk a very long way from the airport buildings to our aircraft through, what seems like, the world's longest bus stop. Coming back was worse. We seemed be locked out of the building. It took around 10 minutes before anyone appeared. They then put out a tannoy announcement apologising for the delay caused by an influx of incoming flights. This caused much amusement as ours was the only flight around.",2
"Long walk from plane to terminal. We were the only plane to land in around 2 hours.
Long delay waiting for bags to get on the belt.
No taxi for 1 hour Arrow has the contract and their service is diabolical.",2
"Worst airport experience ever. Flew.in at 5.00pm -.waited 25 minutes for passport control, waited for luggage, then customs gate was locked with nobody allowed through! Announcements that delays were due to the number of incoming flights. Excuse me these were scheduled and expected flights.
Only prompt service was  Arrow taxi desk.
Please let me go from Doncaster next time.",2
"Amerigo Vespucci Airport is a top-notch facility that truly goes above and beyond in providing exceptional service to travelers. From the moment I entered the airport, I was impressed by the cleanliness, efficiency, and overall organization of the entire operation. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous, making my travel experience stress-free and enjoyable.

The airport offers a wide range of amenities, including numerous dining options, shopping outlets, and comfortable seating areas. I especially appreciated the free Wi-Fi service, which allowed me to stay connected throughout my time at the airport.

The departure and arrival process was seamless and well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff to guide passengers every step of the way. Additionally, the airport's convenient location and efficient transportation options make it easy to access from various parts of the city.

Overall, I highly recommend Amerigo Vespucci Airport to anyone traveling in or out of the area. It truly sets the standard for excellence in airport services, and I look forward to visiting again in the future.",5
"Big improvements during the past few years thanks to the tramway, the new traffic circulation when leaving the airport.

People working there proved to be top notch when dealing with issues (canceled flights), coffee options are decent for italian standards.

Unfortunately the main issues are still there: only 1 runway, gates are tight and will get crowded in no time, insufficient waiting areas.

Main thing: if you are flying internationally you’d better consider Pisa for landing/departing, a bit of wind can make the airport unusable",3
"This airport is always chaotic. From checking to baggage claim it always feels like you're rambling through a third world flea market. Thank goodness the staff are always nice and helpful. There is a lot to streamline in this airport.

Getting there is easier than before. The tram next to the airport takes you to the train station in Firenze where you can then catch a train to take you lost places in Tuscany. We stayed in Lucca and rather than paying nearly €200 for a private shuttle we paid less than €20 for the tram and train. If your willing to walk it's the easiest and cheapest way to get around.",3
"Visited this airport on in November at 9:30AM on a Thursday and the airport was not packed at all. it took 5 minutes to go through security— quick, fast & efficient. In total , ~15 minutes to get to the gate area  from airport arrival to sitting down with carryon luggage.

I would gauge when you go based on season so you don’t have to wait too long at the airport.

We got to the airport 2.5 hrs early based on the reviews, but likely only needed 1.5 or less.

Nice & clean airport too.

-1 star for the lack of seating at the gating area. I can see why this gets bad ratings because it’s super packed by having several gates on top of each other and board within the same hall. On a busier day, I can see this being a nightmare.",4
"AVOID DEPART/ARRIVE AT THIS AIRPORT AT ALL COST!!!

Date: December 2, 2023

It’s one of the worst airport experiences I’ve ever had. I had to agree with all the bad reviews, as it is as bad as everyone says.

After receiving boarding pass, was denied to enter security because flight has not arrived yet. Was told it was 5th on queue to land and just needed to wait. After waiting approximately 40-60 minutes, with no place to rest/sit (many passengers were sitting on the floor), found out flight was cancelled. NO REASON given by airport staff, no flight cancellation announcement was made. I found out by logging online through the airline website and going back and forth to the ticketing counter.

After waiting about 4 hours in limbo, went to the ticket counter to check on updates. Was given a handwritten note to check in tomorrow morning. No compensation/voucher for food, transportation and hotel stay. Couldn’t stay in airport to avoid paying out of pocket for accommodation since airport closes at midnight! Didn’t even help you to book hotel when everything around the airport was fully booked on a Saturday night. In fact, was asked “what is a hotel?” when tried to ask a employee for hotel suggestions. Then asked the information counter, and response was to wait for the announcement which had nothing to do with your flight, only thing you could hear is DO NOT SMOKE announcement.

Wrote a complaint letter to airline after arriving and airline refused any responsibility, stating cancellation was due to bad weather? (See attached pics of a nice sunny day, stayed over night didn’t even see a rain drop). Of course I’m no expert on flying condition, I wouldn’t want to fly in bad weather either; but if this airport is so sensitive that it couldn’t even handle any cloud/wind, then why even built the airport here? Why didn’t transfer passengers to nearby cities’ airports and try to depart on the same date?

In summary this airport has:
* Incompetent staff, no communication whatsoever
* Bad design: no place to sit, only able to fly when weather is perfect
* Bad operating hours (doesn’t open 24/7)
This kind of service is unacceptable anywhere but especially from an international airport in a major city in Europe.

I gave one more star for the automated espresso machine as it is the only good functional item in the entire airport. For people who still want to/from travel to this airport, be ware only assuming only on a perfect weather day, everything is great, no checked bags, then this place will work. But it’s too much of a risk to use this airport as part of your trip.

I hope Italy will improve the conditions of this airport and lower its delay/cancellation rate that causes tremendous inconvenience to both the passengers and the airlines.

——————————————————————————
In sintesi questo aeroporto ha:
* Personale incompetente, nessuna comunicazione
* Cattivo design: nessun posto dove sedersi, in grado di volare solo quando il tempo è perfetto
*Orari di apertura errati (non apre 24 ore su 24, 7 giorni su 7)
Questo tipo di servizio è inaccettabile ovunque, ma soprattutto da un aeroporto internazionale in una delle principali città europee.

Ho dato una stella in più per la macchina per caffè espresso automatizzata poiché è l'unico articolo funzionante in tutto l'aeroporto. Per le persone che vogliono ancora viaggiare da/per questo aeroporto, fate attenzione solo supponendo che solo in una giornata con un tempo perfetto, tutto sia fantastico, senza bagagli registrati, quindi questo posto funzionerà. Ma è troppo rischioso utilizzare questo aeroporto come parte del tuo viaggio.

Spero che l’Italia migliori le condizioni di questo aeroporto e riduca il tasso di ritardi/cancellazioni che causa enormi disagi sia ai passeggeri che alle compagnie aeree.",2
"Disaster of an airport. Check in lines circled entire departures terminal. Withwith only 40 mins of rain, the airport canceled nearly ten international flights. We were then bused to bag claim where we were told to wait for our bags. Our bags did not arrive. No staff helped us. One of our fellow passengers’ Air Tags tracked her luggage to be just outside bag claim sitting on a truck at the tarmac without our sight. However, staff informed us that due to lack of staff, there were no drivers to drive the truck to bag claim! Fellow passengers were rebooked onto flights days later with staff refusing to book hotel rooms for them. We encountered passengers who had lost luggage 3-6 days earlier and had to wear staff yellow coats to search by hand on their own across airport warehouses. Worse, no vending machine or water machine worked - there were elderly/frail people suffering without any help. If we left bag claim we were not allowed back. It has been over four hours and we are all still waiting for our bags without anywhere to go. The worst part is after just 30 mins of canceling most flights, inbound arriving flights began landing anyway and receiving their luggage, despite claims of “understaffing”. Absolute terrible airport experience. PLEASE TAKE A TRAIN IF YOU CAN!",1
"There are 4 people who work at this airport. At any point, half of them are on smoke break. Of the two that remain, one cares about their job and one does not. If you have to pass though this airport, all I have to say is good luck.",2
"This airport is pretty useless. When we first arrived, the wind condition was ~ 14mph, so this airport was closed and we eventually landed in Bologna instead. Although the TAP airline insisted that there will be a transportation arranged from Bologna to Firenze, there was nothing after waiting for an hour. This airport and Bologna airport had nothing prepared for us so we found a way back to the center on our own.

Another issue is the tax refund. I have been to many counties but it is pretty shady what they do here. There was an office on the first floor right in front of the coffee shop, the person will scan your boarding pass, passport and receipts. And then he will ask you to go to the another office nearby to complete. This is a third party vendor, so they make it difficult for you to get the refund via CC, which was the option I chose online. I eventually chose the cash option in dollars, which they take a steep cut (20-30%). This is a pretty touristy place so I am surprised that the local government doesn’t regulate and make the tax refund process easier for tourists? Have a Global Blue machine like other airports, it is not that difficult.

Next time, I will just fly to Rome or other cities and hope it would provide a better experience.",1
"One of the worst airports I've ever seen. The embarking procedures are a joke. Waiting pressed like sardines in a bus, breathing the exhaust fumes. If you're priority, you're likely to wait the longest in the bus and to be the last to get on the plane. The waiting for luggage can be excruciating, with three belts in a small hall bursting with people. Staff is nice but sometimes overwhelmed. Shops are ok.
Avoid it if you can. Get to Pisa, Bologna, or even Rome and take a train.",1
"Small, but nice airport.
Everything works and it's absolutely clean, unlike some other small airports in Europe.
Duty-free is the usual rip-off, but the cafes and snack bars are not. And their offerings are good.
Passport control can be tiresome, even if you are an Italian citizen.  The automatic passport readers aren't automatic, but even if they were they seldom work.
A caution for international travellers  - once you go through the security into the international gate seating area you can't get back out.",4
"Airport is nice enough and small. Many of the employees are just nasty and mean. It’s sad that such a beautiful place has such ugly and rude employees. Swiss Air was the worst. Just ugly, bad people who seem to get off on messing with passengers. Arrogant, snide, insecure people who behave badly as if they got off on it. It’s unhealthy to fly Swiss Air and if possible, I will avoid this airport unless it’s with a decent airline.",2
"If you are trying to claim your tax/duty free, you have to have your airline boarding pass on hand (the one that leaves the EU). Unfortunately, since I am changing airlines with a layover, I wasn’t able to obtain that boarding ticket from the first airline. I had to get my connection boarding pass at the connection airport and go to tax free between my tight layover. It was a little stressful.

The airport is okay for being a small one with one runway. I would not arrive very early as security is simple and there aren’t many shops.",3
"This airport is tiny and has just one very short landing strip so any wind or rain cause flight delay. And then you have to take the bus as walking to the aircraft is not allowed, which also slows things down incredibly. Of course today no exception … 40min delay to Munich … with perfect weather conditions.",2
"Small airport, big surprises. The tram was close to the terminal for easy to and from Florence trips. The arrival/departure lounges were a bit cramped, but overall not bad. The charging ports were for USB, and did not fit our charging cords. The Duty Free was amazing. The restaurants were very good.",4
"Tiny airport that will cancel flights for seemingly no good reason. Had my flight to Paris canceled due to ""low visibility""; however, the clouds cleared and it was sunny skies 30 minutes after they announced the cancellation. Very confusing as to why they wouldn't have delayed but cancelled completely. While I was waiting in line to rebook my travel I talked to three separate parties that all told me this was their second day of cancellations in a row.",2
"A relatively small airport which makes things very fast and easy. While not.many choices in terms of shopping, you can have here a decent coffee, which is more you can say about some other places.",5
"This is a small airport but it works pretty well. We were checked in by BA in about 10 minutes and through security without any delay. There are duty free and food shops once you're through security.

Most gates are on the lower floor where there is another good cafe with fresh food including sandwiches and pastries  (tasted - very good!).

One downside of the airport is that getting to the car hire centre invlives using a bus which gets very full. Be patient! Would be happy to use this airport again.",4
"Never choose this airport as your arrival. You've been warned. As someone who live here in florence, the airport staffs can be really rude to tourists,and I've witnessed that, but if you can speak Italian, they'd be lil kinder to you. Maybe because of the language barrier. It's normal for passengers whose arrival is to florence, to get their luggage delayed 1-3 days, reasons are they'll custom control your every single thing they find strange. I don't really recommend arriving at this airport.",2
"From the security to the boarding crews, all are lacking basic crowd management and communication skills. Very unprofessional. The security was just chatting while a whole line of boxes were stacked. The person who was supposed to manage the bagage was chaotic and did not speak a word of english.
The boarding crew had no organisation, neither communicated the situation properly.  Hope they undertake a training of some kind",2
The airport is kind of small and just functional. Can be a bit crowded during peak hours/season. It's pretty close to the city and there is a tram to get there. The runway has hills on one side and that just looks gorgeous!,5
"It is a small airport that should be easy, but actually it lacks information. Not enough space. No way to contact company people after you pass the security control",2
"This airport feels like a shopping maze. Each time you think you have seen all the shops, a new one is just around the corner. Gets crowded in no-time. A lot of so called managers, shouting in their phones without doing anything.
Best thing: the tram. You arrive or leave in minutes.",3
"I really liked this cool little airport, and I do mean little. Few options for food while you wait, and mass transport is not ideal here, we rented a car which was cool enough.  There are no jetways here so its a bus to and from the terminal and stairs to board the aircraft which is kind cool. Reminds you how big the machines are that lift you into the sky! Hopefully they will expand a little sooner, the airport is often over capacity.",3
"the worst airport I’ve ever experienced. Small, very unorganised and few areas to sit & eat",2
"Today (Wednesday morning 4 AM) is particularly quick and easy, no issues yet, things are opening since the airport opens at 4AM.",4
"Nice small airport. Very easy to reach by tam T2 I think it is still under construction because navigating inside is like walking through a maze.
Fast security check, no shoes off like in the States!
Europeans much relaxed 😌",4
"The airport is well placed near the city ans very easy access to Florence city centre with the T2 tramline. It's 1,50€(2023) for a one-way ticket per person. The airport is small and naturally doesn't offer the same shopping experience as maybe bigger European airports.  From my experience, flights into FLR are often delayed or cancelled due to weather issues, reduced visibility, and owing to the short runway. Flying into Pisa and taking the train could be another possible option",4
"Giving this pathetic excuse of an airport 1 star is being generous. Idiotic, incompetent are nicest words I can use to describe this terrible airport that shouldn’t be even be called that because of how truly awful this place is. Removing people from a flight, not giving them a reason why, delaying said flight, and causing travelers to miss the only connection flight of the day is just the cherry on top of the cake for this horrible airport. Not only did they fail to give a reason for why a flight was delayed, they did nothing to compensate travelers, nothing to ensure they made their connecting flight which they missed because of their incompetence, they also failed to rebook certain passengers, leaving them stranded once they finally reached their destination. Even better, they randomly checked a passengers carry on, and decided to throw it in with the rest of the luggage, which never made it to its destination, and remains stuck in Florence. This airport is a horrible representation for the country of Italy, and whoever operates this airport needs to take a long hard look at the incompetent, unhelpful workers it has. They are a poor representation of the hard working people of the airline industry, airline workers, and  airlines as a whole. For the sake of all travelers, I hope they don’t end up traveling to or from this airport, because the buffoons who operate it don’t know what they’re doing, and will cause you more problems than it is worth.",1
"My recent experience at Amerigo Vespucci Airport on January 2nd, 2024 (I was flying on British Airways to London City) left me utterly disappointed and frustrated.

Despite arriving two hours in advance, the check-in experience was a nightmare. With the airport noticeably empty, the lone staff member at the dedicated check-in desk took an astonishing one hour and thirty minutes to process check-ins, demonstrating a concerning lack of efficiency and professionalism.

Moreover, other airport staff were observed slacking off at deserted desks instead of providing assistance where needed. This inefficiency had a domino effect, causing a substantial delay at the security checkpoint. When I politely requested to use the empty priority queue due to the check-in delay, the employee callously informed us that the delay caused by the check-in process was not her concern and that we were not entitled to use the priority queue without paying for it, regardless of the circumstances.

In conclusion, my experience at Amerigo Vespucci Airport  was marred by abysmal check-in efficiency, unhelpful staff, and an overall lack of consideration for the passengers' time and well-being.",1
"Avoid at all costs!
As soon as the weather conditions are not perfect, there will be a problem with the flight.
I have used this airport not many times, but pretty much on each occasion the flight got delayed, cancelled, diverted, causing additional time and stress.
Much better to use Pisa, it is 1 hour ish from Florence but it is far more efficient.",1
"I witnessed AirDolomiti and Lufthansa employees acting in ways that exhibited not only their lack of basic competence but also their rudeness. I was lucky and had an okay experience, despite choices made by the employees I encountered. However, I witnessed them treat other passengers in ways that were unbelievable. For example, after an unreasonably long check-in counter delay where for one period, for over 30 minutes, 3 Lufthansa employees refused to check in any economy passengers and instead talked to each other (creating an incredibly long line, see photo attached) whereas 2 other Lufthansa employees continued checking in 1st Class passengers. Perhaps this was unavoidable, but it was inconsiderate that they refused to explain the delay to any passengers. We had maybe 20 people ahead of us when we arrived yet it took over 45 minutes to reach the check-in counter.

Another big problem: Lufthansa (operated by AirDolomiti) over-sold the flight. Perhaps this is not something the employees at Florence Airport can change. However, the employees can choose how to handle the situation. I witnessed 8 people get “kicked off” the flight. However, the employees did not tell them until the very last moment when they were scanning their ticket at the gate. This happened after the long check-in delay and also the flight itself (Florence to Munich) was delayed by 120 minutes. Why did the employees make the passengers suffer for hours and hours before telling them they must leave the airport and get a flight tomorrow? There are no other flights today and Lufthansa forced many passengers to stay an additional night in Florence. This also includes 2 passengers who had booked first class and I overheard they are Star Alliance Gold Members. Why treat them with such thoughtlessness? I found the entire process to be a complete clusterf*ck and the employees were either not around at all to help, or were very inconsiderate and rude to the passengers they had inconvenienced for 3+ hours.

Avoid this airport at all costs… or beware. Alternatively, take the high speed train to Rome and fly from Roma.

This happened 12-JUNE 2022.",1
"As soon as you enter from the arrival entrance and the door sliding, you feel all the way a disgusting latrine smell… thinking that you have to wait your luggage few steps away from the toilettes, let you image the welcome to Florence experience!
What a shame …",1
"Maybe the worst airport I have used, including worse than third world countries airports that I have visited. Even basic services like a, restaurant are nearly non existent, waiting rooms and gates are small, rundown, have very little seating and overcrowded. Flights are often cancelled because of fog or wind. To be avoided if possible.",1
"Very small, no great choice of food and drinks. Don’t stop at the first cafe near gate 1, the one further up is much better.",3
"Today the following has happened to me. I was booked on a flight 15.05 - 16.30 Florence - Vienna with Austrin Airlines.
I have arrived at the airport on time - I actually was through security checks and in the gate area by 13.10.
When waiting at the gate, by 14.30, it was shown on the airport screens that the flight was delayed by one hour and would depart only at 16.05. I have also at that moment received an email with a new boarding pass for 15.40.
The downstairs departure hall of Florence airport was extremely crowded, which is why I went upstairs (this is still in the gate area) and waited. When I came back downstairs at 15.40, the flight had actually completed the booking and I was not let in anymore. There was _no passanger call or anything like this
I was advised to go out of the gate area to the ticket office. There I was first scolded, then after quarreling offered an indirect flight, with change in Munich for tomorrow morning 06.30 to Vienna for which I need to be at Florence airport at 04.30 (no public transport even at that time). The agent on the phone tried twice to depict me as responsible for what has happened.
To be fair, the third airport agent I talked to (at the ticket desk) was very friendly and helpful, but she could not change anything. The second one (at the Austrian Airlines desk) was extremely unfriendly; and the one at the gate equally.
I am finally taking a night train that only arrives tomorrow at 09.00 and have submitted for a refund to the airline.
I am very, very unhappy about what has happened today at this airport and about how I have been treated. This has not happened to me at a European airport before.
If there is mismanagement of flight schedules, your institution must make up for this, not passengers.",1
"One step up from a refugee camp. Very few places to sit. No water fountains or place to fill a water bottle. Busses from the gate to the plane. Have to take off your sweater for security, but can get glassware and glass bottles after security. Definitely interesting, but stoked for the cheap flight to Athens. 😅",3
"My best advice, avoid at any cost! VERY claustrophobic, hot, no air, poor service and totally overcrowded to top it all. Please Eat before you arrive.",1
"• NO overnight stay for early flight customers (reopens @4am)
• Size is small
• baggage claim bathroom is smelly. But overall everything met minimum/ average.",2
There is no staff after the pandemic and all flights are delayed by 2-3hr because of NO STAFF after the pandemic. The airport has not hired anyone! If I could I would give a 0 star 🤣,1
"Very slow check in at the Sas gate. Lousy service. Can't recommend this airport, unless you have lots of time to waste.",1
Small airport. No bridge links to planes when I travelled. There are some shops and cafes and a duty free. Good tram link to Florence main train station takes about 20 mins €1.70 Dec 2023.,3
Airport is clean and well managed. There are 3 different places to shop for goods. You will pass them on the way to the gate. Overall good airport,4
Nice little airport. Quick checkin and security. Quite a few snack and coffee options. Better than most small airports.,4
Very small duty free. One coffee shop before you enter the gates. Another one with no seating after the security baggage check. The coffee shop after the luggage check has a decent variety of food.,2
"Better than expected after reading all the negative comments here. There were no problems with my luggage, there are several shops and places to eat. The airport is too small to handle the amount of passangers but my general impression is positive.",4
"Only landed here, so my review talks only to arrivals. Bags were delivered very efficiently. The quickest transition from landing to tram I have had at any worldwide airport. Really impressive and very welcome when you land late like we did.",5
Long waiting time to check in luggage (flew British Airways) and not enough seating area if you show up early.,1
"Friendly staffs. The airport is really small. I was departing at around 11am on Tuesday and there was literally no lineups. Especially with Vueling, no lineups on check-ins, and then security check.",5
"Very small airport, no much to see as an entertainment during long waits for the flights, very few shops available. You can find two cafes with average food displayed, couple vending machines and no much more. Only positive was the abundance of USB attachments to charge your phone.",3
"Writing this review because I was expecting an absolute disaster based off previous reviews but I had such a seamless experience here. There was no line for check in, I was the third person. No line for security. My plane boarded early and left on time and my luggage was not lost with a connecting flight in Rome to Palermo. I flew out at the beginning of September so perhaps with less tourists it’s easier to manage but I wanted to write this review to let people know a good experience IS possible at this airport.",5
"Florence/Firenze airport .
They don't allow travellers before the time so we have to wait outside to get it open

Please note
Airport Open time 4:00 am",4
"Only good thing here is the free WiFi. Completely crazy prices for food at the restaurants and kiosk.
Food vending machines have broken card modules.",2
"By any measurement Italy is a top 3 country in Europe and a global leader in many industries. While that may be the case, traveling through FLR, a top 10 Italian city, is not reflective of Italy’s economic power.
This airport feels more like a made up airport rather than an international hub for the Tuscan region.
Leaders, you’re enabling the misrepresentation of the Italian people, culture and innovation to occur at any moment FLR is not reflecting those qualities,  it’s time to change that.",2
"Although the airport is a regional one, the check in went really smooth with ITA Airways  and the security check point went well!  You just need to pay attention to the gate 1, it is located at the sencond floor in front of the vip lounge. By the way, they dont have fingers to serve the airplanes.",5
Had to wait 55 minutes for bags. There were no other flights landing during this period. Absolutely disgraceful way to treat passengers that pay a lot in airport fees and charges to fly through Firenze airport.,1
"This airport is very important to the city and a gateway to Tuscany.  However the lost and found office working hours are a urgent need of change. Currently the hours of operation are from 8am-9am and from 9am to 3pm (15:00) the office is closed. Passengers can not speak with anyone by phone either. Emails are not returned promptly due to the hours of operation.

This creates a very stressful environment and a poor experience to passengers arriving to airport.
The airport provides 2 kiosks, however passengers are in need of help and prompt assistance.

Improving and addressing this matter urgently will provide passengers a better experience. This is extremely important to tourism for the beautiful city of Firenze. The city deserves a better customer service experience at it’s airport for it’s  residents and visitors.
Please consider address this matter at once.",1
Lovely small airport. Easily reachable from central Florence in just 25 minutes if you take the T2 tram (ticket only costs €1.50!). Pleasantly surprised by how clean and tidy the terminal was,5
"Rinky dinky tiny airport—very crowded, so I strongly recommend getting here 2.5-3h before your departure. Bathrooms are not great—no soap—but useable. The service/staff that I encountered were very nice though, so despite the crowds and chaos I was able to get through security and check my baggage (with self-service kiosk) fairly quickly. Boarding was a bit stressful as they only called zones 1-2 and then went immediately into last call, after which you get into a bus (make sure you get on the correct one!)",3
"After they lost our check bag (and the bags of over half the other people on our flight) we all spent 5 hours waiting in line and got a piece of paper with an email and help line that's only open 2 hours out of the day. The email address doesn't accept emails. Apparently the inbox is full. I've called the given number 5 times during the hours it's supposedly operating. Never received an answer. You also can't physically get back to the lost baggage desk once you leave the airport because you exit through customs. So basically there is nothing we can do. We have 10 days left in our vacation and have lost thousands of dollars worth of clothes, hygiene products, and even medicine. Never fly into the Florence airport.

Update: Now back in the US. Never got our bag. Still don't have it. Had to finish the 11 days remaining in our vacation with whatever we had in our carry on.",1
"My experience is a great one! My wife and I flew into this airport almost exactly 2 years ago moving to Italy.  It is a great small airport compared to Rome or some of larger cities in Italy but it is very busy during the summer times and easy to get in and out of.  It's also easy to get a flight to almost anywhere in Europe from this airport. ""The little American's writer from Pisa Foundation """,4
"First flight to Florence got cancelled with no explanation by them, the flight back got delayed (had to sit an entire hour in the airplane) to the point where the connecting flight had to be rebooked to another time. The reason for the 15 seconds bus drive from the gate to the airplane is nonsensical and inefficient. Avoid this airport when travelling to Florence!",1
"Don’t come here if it is not necessary. This is a chaotic, unorganized & overcrowded airport where you will never see your luggage again once it is lost, even if it is there. I have never seen such a long line of people at the lost and found desk. It takes you hours before it’s your turn. Lost luggage: my friends luggage was not with our flight. After two days of lost luggage in such a small airport, she decided to look for her luggage at the airport and returned by taxi to the airport. She saw 1000’s of lost luggages which will never be sent back to their owners even if they are there labeled!",1
"Overcrowded with no seating. Staff was very slow and unhelpful after our luggage was lost. When they did receive our luggage they made no attempt to reach out to us to tell us. We had to go to airport ourselves where dozens of other people were in line to get lost luggage. They eventually let us in the back room to look through the hundreds of other lost bags to see if we couldn’t find ours which we did because they were very distinct looking. Then on our way out our flight was canceled and the airport was terrible again about giving us any updates about what was happening. There was no staff to assist us and customer service just told us to stand at a certain spot until someone came to get us which they eventually did hours later. Meanwhile we had no way of knowing if they were actually doing anything to book us a hotel and transportation since our rebooked flight was for 20 hours later. When we asked for any information we were repeatedly told that they had no idea because it wasn’t their department and would just try to pawn us off on someone else. If you want to visit Florence do yourself a favor and avoid this airport at all cost. Take a train in. Also, good luck getting a taxi from the airport. We waited in line for 30 minutes, barely moving anywhere and decided to just take the train and walk because at that rate we would have been standing there for hours",1
"Possibly the least effective airport in the world. Came 04:30 in the morning, have checked-in online, and still need to stand 2 hours in line to drop off luggage. There were 3 open desks, but then 2 of them left and didnt return. A family of 5 got priority to buy tickets, wich alone took 25 minutes (they arrived last in the line). Theres also almost no seating, food or other things you would think was normal in a «modern» airport. Stay clear if possible, this is not worth it.",1
"I flew both in and out of this airport and had absolutely no issues whatsoever. Flying into it from the UK, there are no customs to go though (just bag collection if you checked in luggage), which makes it really easy to get out. When I was leaving, I probably got to the airport 2 hours before and there was nearly no wait for check-in. I’ve seen a lot of other posts complaining about the customer service but as I was waiting to check-in, I saw some workers do nearly everything in their power to get a family with small children onto their flight that they were about to miss. I thought it was incredibly kind and I’m sure the family really appreciated it. Security was proficient and once through, there are enough shops to browse through until your flight. I was also able to find a seat by a plug where I waiting until boarding.",5
"This airport is a disgrace for the entire region of Tuscany. And a living example of an incapability to design functional infrastructure.

The car rental companies are located in a parking lot 5 minutes outside of the airport building. It can only reached by shuttle running every 15 minutes in circles.

The passenger flow is a negligent usage of the available building space. 2- way hallways with 1.2m of width, so a kid's stroller and a handlugguge can not pass the space at the same time.
4 souvenir stores, 4 luxury boutiques and 2 ""restaurants"". Maybe a mismatch for passenger needs?

Mentioning the outdated interior is probably not even worth mentioning.

And why do you have to take the bus to the plane at a small airports with only 10 gates?",1
"There are a tonne of one stars and some are deserved but to shine a light on a few things.
This is a small regional airport that has international flights. There are only a hand few of gates and they are all basically bus stops. So be ready to board a bus that takes you to the plane. The outside does look older but the interior is modern if small. My KLM staff was very helpful especially after a small mishap with my ticket and some perfume. If you are flying with the budget Euro companies you may have some issues. Over all just remember this is a very small airport for a huge tourist city.",3
"I’d agree with all the poor reviews.  Chaotic, claustrophobic, long lines, minimal food options. Security lady was very rude when we asked her a simple question, and gave us a dirty look and was a major grouch. Probably because we don’t speak Italian?  I’d try to avoid this airport if I were to do this again.",1
This was my first time flying into this airport and it was very different from the other larger European airports that we have been to. We disembarked on the tarmac and to a very short bus ride to the baggage claim. It was really easy to navigate and there was no extensive screening.,4
"Check in line looked to be 2 hours.

The flights were 90% delayed (see pic).

The location is very small and super slow. You will most likely miss your flight or connection if you aren't here many hours in advance.

The worst airport I've ever had to go through. There are only 10 gates that are bunched up in a single location with maybe enough seats for 100 people total.

Our gate was changed to a different one and with the mad dash of desperate travelers, it became chaos as lines turned into a crowd and everyone was trying to get into the shuttle bus that takes you straight to the plane.

There is no direct access to the plane here, all flights must be via a shuttle.

Highly recommend to try and avoid flying out of this airport and make the trip to another city's airport.",1
"DO NOT FLY IN/OUT OF THIS AIRPORT. My husband and I went to Italy to elope and we could not have been more excited however when we arrived to Florence our bags were no where to be found which had not just our wedding rings but also my dress inside. We waited in line for an hour just to be handed a piece of paper and told maybe they’d arrive on the next flight due in 3 hours. The lady at the desk said we could  go to our hotel then come back and check, no worries. When we went back just an hour later however the lost and found office was closed so there was no way for us to get to our bags even if they had arrived. We had to completely scratch our elopement plans and had to go out and buy clothes since we didn’t have any in our carry on bags. We were told we’d receive a text when our bags were found but we never did, we went back to the airport a day and a half later to see what was going on and had to wait another hour for an employee to walk us back to a giant room full of lost bags where we had to scramble through everything to find ours. My husbands suitcase also was now missing a wheel. Fast forward to 10 days later and we’re getting ready to leave. We got a text at 1 am informing us our 10 am flight had been cancelled but there was no further information about rebooking provided. We luckily were awake but after nearly 2 hours of trying to figure out what was going on and going in circles on their website we finally gave up and decided we’d try again at the airport in the morning. We went to the airport the next morning to figure out if we had a new flight or if we could get a hotel for the night, customer service sent us to the airline assistant, the airline assistant sent us to customer service and customer service told us to wait in a random line and we’d be taken to our hotel but had no other information. We did not know what hotel we’d be staying at, when we’d be picked up, nothing. We waited for nearly two hours asking anyone we could what was happening and no one gave us any information. Our flight was rebooked for a full day later and all our flights we don’t sit next to eachother, a total of 15 hours on planes after our honeymoon and we sat on completely different parts of the plane. Over all I understand that things happen, but no one at any point gave us information, tried to help us in anyway, or was direct and honest with us. No one showed empathy about our elopement being ruined, the airport staff was slow, uncaring, and at times even rude despite us doing our best to keep ourselves together with all the inconveniences they were causing. We loved Italy but we will never, ever again fly into the Florence airport.",1
"Small airport. Not a lot of options for food, drinks or other types of retail shops.

Seating is also a bit short. I guess maybe it was exceptionally busy because of Easter holidays.",3
"First I could not get a digital boarding pass, requiring me to stand in line to manual check-in even if I had no baggage to check. Then the areas inside of security are so tiny that it cannot hold the passengers. Only two cafes found and they were overfull with long lines. Corridors are so tiny with lots of people so you almost get phobia. Each gate only have a few chairs so you cannot sit down while waiting. Only good thing is that the security check was pretty fast.",2
"Your baggage handing NEEDS to be fixed!! Our entire plane lost their luggage and have been waiting for two hours for bags. No one has been willing to help us, they keep saying 10 minutes and then nothing happens. There are pregnant women waiting, upset, without their luggage. Do better.",1
"Vespucci Airport is the BESTPucci airport. I met my wife, Linda, back in 1950. Best time of my life. We’re divorced now, but 10/10 stars! 👍",5
What a mess. Small airport so different airline check in lines overlap. Because of this there was only one line and you can not tell your in the wrong line.  We did not know for the first hour in line. There is only two clerks for 4 airlines. 2 1/2 hours to check in and we had no baggage. Don’t last minute this airport. We arrived at the airport 3 hours early and made it to the gate just in time. My photo is after an hour plus and still could not tell we were in the wrong line along with another 30-40 people.,2
Terrible experience on Saturday 9th. Our BA flight plus another BA flight became a MASSIVE problem due to weight on board and not being able to take off on the short runway due to strong winds.While we waited over 2 hours back at the gate NONE of the drinks machines would take cash nor card. We weren't offered even a bottle of water. Not enough seating and just general lack of help or information. Avoid this airport!!!,2
"Maybe instead of focusing on duty free shops, FLR should improve customer lines and airport safety. The landing strip is too short and flights are often cancelled due to unsafe landing conditions associated with the length of the runway. Airport expansion has been on the books for years but it’s been blocked by italy’s stifling bureaucracy. FLR is more like a zoo than a healthy airport. Fly through Pisa of possible.",1
"One of the worst airport in Italy, the airport layout make no sense. Stairs up and down, then they put ALL the passengers on a tiny room, no seats or enough bathrooms. Then on a bus for 15 minutes to get all the passengers of your flight and the bus ride is about 15 seconds....patetic....
I miss the Pisa airport.....way better and easy for traveling to, parking etc....",1
"Good connections to the city - taxis are about 30 euros into Florence. The tram from the centre goes direct to here (although it wasn't working the day we went without any notice so be careful).

Baggage collection quick, check in relatively good too - not many food options given the number of people, limited space to sit and enjoy any meal.",3
Had a great experience flying from here. Easy to reach with T2 tram from city centre in 20 minutes. Check-in had normal length queues - so arrive earlier if you have hold baggage. Security took 4 minutes.,5
"Oh, dear Florence Airport, where do I begin? My recent visit left me utterly flabbergasted, and not in a good way. One star is a generous rating for this place that seems to exist solely to test the limits of human patience.

Upon arrival, I was greeted by a seemingly endless queue that resembled a snake on a never-ending journey. I half-expected to see explorers with machetes hacking their way through the wilderness, but no luck there. If standing in line for what feels like an eternity is your idea of a fun time, Florence Airport is your dream destination.

Now, let's talk about the seating situation—or should I say lack thereof? Finding a place to rest my weary bones was like searching for a needle in a haystack. And when I did stumble upon a chair, it seemed to have been designed by a medieval torture enthusiast. Florence Airport seems to think discomfort is a feature, not a bug.

But here's the kicker, folks. In a world where basic amenities like water stations are considered standard, Florence Airport boldly bucks the trend. They must think we're all camels, as there's nary a drop of H2O to be found. Maybe they want us to savor the taste of their overpriced bottled water as a souvenir of our torment.

In conclusion, Florence Airport, you've outdone yourself in providing an unforgettable experience—but not in the way you might hope. This place is a masterclass in inefficiency, discomfort, and disdain for the weary traveler. If you enjoy a masochistic adventure, by all means, book your ticket. For the rest of us, pray for a terminal transformation that makes this place remotely bearable.",1
"This airport is simply too small for the amount of passengers it’s trying to serve. As a port for the whole Tuscany region, it’s a disaster. There’s nowhere to sit, people are routinely sitting all over the floor. Past security, there are only 2 bars that quickly run out of food and tables. The bathrooms are kind of modern but just so so filthy, it’s disgusting. It doesn’t seem like anything is under control here.",1
No air conditioning...not conducive to a pleasant trip. Overpriced shop at gate 2!,2
"Best tiny airport experience in the Florence area... no crowds in the Spring time, small enough to reach gates easily, VIP club for business class has refreshments and privacy ..
Dont travel with big group .. don't travel in the Summer.",4
"Showed up 2hrs 45min early. Check-in doesn't open until 2 hrs before flight. They don't even tell you which kiosk will be the check-in spot. (It's not always the same kiosk.) So 2 hrs before flight, the kiosk number pops on the screen, I head over, and there's already like 30 people in line. I guess they found the info before I did, but how? I had talked with employee twice when I first arrived. No idea what I missed.

The worst part is I didn't even have bags to check in! I just needed a boarding pass, which for some reason I couldn't get through the airline's app. All-around terrible experience.",1
"absolutely terrible. too small and needs upgrades. luggage was missing for one of my colleagues and another person. they said it can take up to 24 hours for luggage to arrive. i went up to this place with her and not only, besides the nice lady working in lost in found, we’re the security agents rude to her and careless about her missing luggage, they were also rude to me as if this was our fault or like we wanna be back up at place. she never got her luggage. another person and i damage done to our luggage. this place is also very scary at night. they obviously don’t have issues with letting people from outside walk around drunk carrying alcohol bottles around. i did not feel safe here and am possibly considering moving my flight back home to somewhere else.",1
This airport is very convenient is really a city town Airport easy to get with all the facilities you need with short parking or longer parking the airport is very busy and offer plenty flights to most European town they have just the move the departure area to a new duty free location with more shops available the downstairs has the new bar and patisserie and drinks,5
"This dumpster will leave you stranded. Short runway and if a pigeon farts, they cancel the whole thing due to wind. Do not count on this place. If you need to get somewhere, go someplace else.",1
"Comedy of errors - lost baggage, found it, then lost it again. Sent to the wrong address, then sent back to Australia with no contact prior. when I was still traveling in Europe. Phone line for lost baggage is only manned 2h a day, but never got through after 10+ calls. Email bounces. Just be aware if you chose to travel through this airport and lose your bag it will be a struggle.",1
"Very nice airport, it is easy to get around and there are a nice parking space.",5
I only arrived. There needs to be better signage for getting a taxi. Signs pointed one way at an exit but that wasn't correct. A kind fellow directed me to the proper area.,4
"The worst airport I have ever visited.
Flight had delayed. The screen got updated different than the Lufthansa App, seems they did not want to tell the correct delay time to the passenger, just updated them little by little.
The WCs were super dirty. No soap at all.
Small bistro with few choices and too costly",1
"Was excited to fly in/out of here due to convenience. It was absolutely pathetic. Check-in lines were not staffed enough, ramp shuttle driver didn't even know how to drive the shuttle, not enough chairs, no free water filling station. Do not fly here.",1
"Opening hours 4am-12.30am.

This is absurd! Airports should be 24/7. Especially, in cities like Florence, one of the most touristy ones in the world.

Imagine people flying at 6am in January. Letting people wait outside the airport with -7 degrees Celsius.

Horrible.",1
"Apparently this airport “closes” during certain hours and they kicked us out into the street until 4am. how nice of them 😌 staff open whenever they want. got a flight in 2 hours? let me yawn, drink my coffee, chat a little, THEN worry about your flight 🙄🙄🙄 this airport is hot garbage. y’all might make fun of America but there’s a reason we’re so efficient and your city still in Roman times 🥴🥴🥴do better.",1
"Disorganised mess. After a series of hallways which can best be described as being in a hospital, you get to the gates where there's not nearly enough room for a few hundred people.

Gate staff was disorganised, we waited ages for a bus and there was no priority boarding.
I used to fly +100K miles a year and never experienced something like this.

The only positive point is the security. The wait was OK and the staff among the friendliest I've encountered at a security checkpoint.",1
"A small but convenient airport, the terminal adequate with the usual facilities. I don't recommend the overpriced ""DutyFree-Shop"", same as anywhere in Italy. The location restricts aircraft types, usually the A318 is the largest aircraft here. To get to the city, take the cheap and convenient tramline T2. Ticket costs €1,50 and allows transfer to othe tram- and buslines.",4
"The worst airport experience I’ve ever had, very similar to other reviews. After an hour and a half queueing to check in Vueling staff refused to give us our boarding passes because they didn’t know if they would be able to take a full flight due to “strong winds”. We eventually made it through security and onto the flight. We waited on the tarmac for two hours with very little information from Vueling staff and no water/refreshments and were then taken back to the terminal because the wind was “too strong” - according to the BBC weather app it was a “gentle breeze” of 11mph. After an hour of waiting with no information our flight was cancelled.

We then had to wait two hours in another queue to find out our options, which ended in being given a flight from Rome at 7am the next day (a three hour taxi ride away). Services at the airport were very limited with no food other than sandwiches available while we waited another hour for our taxi.

This seems to be a recurring problem - due to a short runway and mountains on one side, flights cannot take off unless conditions are absolutely perfect. I strongly advise you to book flights to Bologna, Pisa or Rome instead.",1
Worst airport I've been to by far. Not a single staff member at the gates....,1
"Checkin and security (both priority) went smooth. After that the airport lacks capacity. Lounge was full, hardly any available seats anywhere else in airport. Very crowded at gates.",2
Very small airport and took a very long time to check in luggage. The passport control check man was talking on a phone call while doing his job. The vueling check in staff tried to charge us extra for our baggage without even checking if we had priority tickets then backed off when I insisted she checked. Very unprofessional and unpleasant people.,1
"We were in time for bag dropping, long line, self-bag dropping out of order. We were told we might not get on our flight due to windy weather. 15 min before take-off we were handed our boarding passes. No one cared if we could make it through security in time. we had to jump the queue and run to the gate, where we heard ourselves being paged for the last time. At the last minute we reached the gate. Staff was very rude.",1
"Lovely place..
Toilet are neat and clean,, staff is good...
I really like this little airport.. 😍",3
"Airport is clean.

Departure security clearances was done at acceptable speed.

The tram from Florence city to the airport is too slow. Though the price is good.
Cant complain.

Thank you.",3
My wife flew out of this airport loads hers and others luggage on the plane and then proceeded to take some of it off.  Our carrier has tried to reach them multiple times to enquirer about her luggage and has received no response. If you try calling they are only taking calls for one hour in the morning and one in the afternoon.  We know the luggage is there because there is an air tag in it.  Worst customer support I have ever witnessed.  Pretty bad when they don’t even respond to the airlines.  I would avoid this airport.,1
"KL1462, 30/06/2023 our flight to Amsterdam was cancelled because of bad weather. After, our bags were unloaded and left on the tarmac, while 100+ passengers were left to wait for bags that were 10 metres away from them (they were just outside the baggage hall). We were forced to wait 5 hours while many of those passengers missed their rebooked flights. Why? Because the company ""Consulta"" didn't prioritised active flights, and then afterwards, went to eat lunch. 100 passengers in the baggage hall with no food, no water, no escape until they could get their baggage. 3x the terminal supervisor and consulta supervisor were called, and there was nobody in sight to help. An older lady working at lost and found told us it was not her department and started shouting at us to go away.

How did we get our baggage? 100 of us started shouting at the Consulta workers after 5 hours, with an Italian traveller screaming the loudest to get our bags onto the conveyor belt. They were still reluctant.

@KLM, contract a different company to handle your baggage at this airport. Consulta are by far the most incompetent baggage handlers I've ever come across. This was unacceptable and quite frankly a disgusting experience from a customer's perspective. Imagine being a KLM customer stuck in a baggage hall with 0 information or help from staff for 5 hours, while knowing that the bags are literally behind a sliding door.

@Consulta anyone working between 12pm-1700pm should be asked to review what happened this day, and the supervisor should be fired. Many passengers who were walking on the tarmac were saying they had to walk past a pile of baggage just outside. It is inexcusable and your company should not receive any contracts to handle baggage.

@Airport staff, the terminal supervisor who is responsible for the baggage hall between 1200-1600 on 30 June 2023 should be fired. You do not leave 100 passengers waiting for bags 10 metres away from the baggage hall. You get the contractor moving bags to keep passengers moving through the terminal.

This airport does not even have baggage handling company offices inside the baggage hall, just a lost and found department that takes almost no responsibility. In short, passengers should avoid flying from this airport. Its the worst airport I have ever been to, (almost) full of incompetent staff who don't deserve to have a job. The only polite, useful staff were customs control.

I sincerely hope this airport has an overhaul in staff and processes. Its no wonder many others have had similar terrible experiences. What a waste of time.",1
"Very disorganized airport where nothing works. The bag self drop-in doesn't work, conveier belts don't work and the check in is extremely slow",1
"I’ve had a terrible time at this airport. Upon arrival, my baggage was lost. At the lost and found counter, they made it seem like I would get contacted the next day, and if I have any questions to call or email. See attached photo. However, the email they provide doesn’t work, and I have called over 20 times during the scheduled hours, and they never pick up. What a disappointment. I would avoid this airport at all costs.",1
"Small airport, but nice and functional. It would be good to provide more seats in the area around the restaurant before the gates.",4
"This is the worst airport with the most apathetic employees. It's not enough that they have days, weeks of bags waiting be processed but they will do nothing to try and help you. If you're waiting in the blazing sun for a chance to look through hundreds of bags hoping to find yours you might be greeted by 2 employees taking a smoke break for the total 4 hours the office seems to be open. In my 6 days calling, checking, arriving to the airport I met hundreds of passengers in the same state. Lines of people waiting at the lost and found window, waiting outside at gate 8 with no communication, empty offices, rude employees. You may know your bag is here. You may see the air tag for 3 days. IT DOES NOT MATTER. If you've had a good experience here, count yourself lucky, because that is the exception not the rule.",1
"Worst airport EVER. Avoid flying to/from at all costs if you can. Lost luggage, canceled flights with little to no information. On top of our flight getting canceled, we have been waiting to retrieve our bags for almost two hours. People with AirTags can see the bags are only 300 feet away, yet they claim they don’t “have anyone to drive the truck full of luggage back to baggage claim.” Terrible airport, small as hell, and customer service is AWFUL! Flights two hours before us got to leave, now we don’t get to leave until 7:40pm tomorrow. Still no vouchers either.",1
"My bags were delayed and I was told it would delivered in ~24 hours and given contact details. Because I’ve got Apple Air Tags, I know that my bag sat at the airport for 3 days, although the automated notice said it hasn’t arrived. Eventually I drove back to the airport, and was allowed into the warehouse to hunt for my bag. I found it - had indeed just been sitting there for days. Thank god for b",1
Absolutely miserable experience. Canceled our flight due to weather however let other flights fly out. Told us to go to baggage claim for our luggage. No one knew where our luggage was. Took them over 4 hours to get our luggage even though our luggage was just outside (people had AirTags). They refused to get it to us earlier because all the KLM staff somehow clocked off work and didn’t care to get us our luggage beforehand. Rebooked multiple flights to two days later and refused to give us compensation for the flights because it was “weather related”. The next day coming to the airport they refuse to let you check in unless it’s 2 hours before and the staff are rude and unhelpful.,1
"""A small yet well-organized airport.""",5
Vespucci airport was probably the best airport i’ve ever had the pleasure of flighting on. Vespucci and I go way back and he’s a pisces. this is me btw,5
Definitely upgraded since last time I visited. Great staff and super nice pilots 👍,5
"Maybe the worst airport i have ever used. Very small and narrow structure, weird passages. On top, had to walk from the building to the plane by passing the airway tarmac, even had to stop for traffic in the middle, well everything has its first.
Additionally i would suggest avoiding the shops they are literally the scam and they even gone further claiming that customer protection laws do not cover Italy. Do not use shops here!",1
"Following a few tips & learnings if your luggage is lost at this airport, similar to ours.

Some context: after the lost & found department actually managed to lose our luggage again, after Lufthansa already forgot it during our stopover in Frankfurt. The l&f department then, here comes the ""best"" part, sent it back home, instead of sending it to our hotel in Firenze - though we asked them to send it there. 🙄

Anyway, I'll share my experiences and especially my learnings I made during my 4 visits at the l&f department:

- At best, don't lose your luggage at this airport. 😁
- If you do lose it, report your case to the lost & found counter right away. Get a case number.
- You are not alone. Everyday new people show up that lost their luggage here.
- If you don't hear from your luggage after a few days, don't try to contact someone by phone or email. It doesn't work, because every hour new people show up at the counter who lost their luggage. See more tips below. 👇
- You have to sort everything out at the office.
- If you are offered a courier service, don't use it. They complicate everything. Pick it up at the airport instead.
- If you came with Lufthansa (or a sub processor) and they forwarded your luggage to a courier to send it to you: try this number +39558026193. This is their Florence office. The number I got from L&F didn't work. 🤷
- Don't give up: ✊ I have seen 2 ladies miraculously find their luggage after their 4th visit.
- Get compensated: 💸 your airline normally compensates clothes, hygiene articles,... Check their website.
- Stay friendly: The local ladies do their best. 💦But they are understaffed.

What to do in case you don't get your luggage after a few days?
1. Pack your case number, your luggage tags, your ID/passport, and 3€ for the train. 🪪👛
2. Get to the Airport/Lost & Found department in the morning 🌇 or evening 🌅 a quarter of an hour before opening time to check the status quo.
3. Just enter the airport and walk down the corridor to the left 👈 until the end. Someone will be waiting to take your details - provide your case number and ID/passport.
4. A security guard will pick you up, you'll get a free airport tour (yeah 🤘) to check the different storage rooms.
5. Check if they have your luggage in one of the storage rooms (office, hangar,...).
6. Check twice - you never know.
7.  Ask the office what happened to your luggage if you can't find it.
8. Start again from 1. if you don't find it. 🔝

Good luck finding your luggage. 🍀🤞",1
"I have traveled a lot in my life. This is the worst airport terminal I have ever been in my party of four arrived at the airport with just a bit less than two hours remaining before our delayed flight was to takeoff for Lisbon Portugal. There were only two window for check-in open. We stood in a line for an hour because we were told by the attendance when you walk in it was the only line for check-in. We got to the window and an extremely rude, heavyset attendant, a female begin to shout at my wife, without any regard for trying to help us solve our problem. At this time there was still an hour before our flight was leaving, but she would not allow us to check in. We missed our flight and our connecting flight from Lisbon to Boston. We had to fly to Rome, spend the night in Rome, and I had to spend an additional $6000 on tickets. I will never go to Florence again or use tap air Portugal.",1
"Absolutely awful airport. We arrived at 10:30am for a 1:40pm flight back to the UK and spent nearly 2 hours waiting in line to get our baggage checked in. 3 people working on the desks for 3 upcoming flights - complete chaos.

When we eventually made it to the desk we were told we couldn't have our boarding passes and that we'd have to hold onto our luggage because the pilot isn't sure if the plane will be too heavy to take off with the current weather (apparently on a short runway with surrounding mountains you need very little wind for safe take off). Flights before ours were being cancelled, passengers told they had been overbooked etc.

Eventually we made it onto the plane where we were told by the captain that 60 people would have to get off the plane due to weight reasons if the wind didn't drop slightly. He then said it was ok and we took off.

Never fly with this airport, understaffed, nobody to ask for help, complete carnage.",1
"Far from stellar.

Drinks machine not working which is desperately helpful when waiting for bags to arrive which KLM lost.

The lost and found department was so swamped at one point that you couldn’t see the office.

Combine that with a machine for lost baggage which prints out BLANK paper 🤦‍♂️ you are probably getting the drift.

Far from stellar.

Regardless, shout out and thanks to the ladies in the lost and found who were friendly and helpful 👍",2
The most inefficient airport with lazy staff. The lost and found people are useless. They lose your luggage and dont even help you to find it. We waited for hours in the airport in long lines to get our luggage back and there was no one to ask question or help understanding the procedure. They are even worst than third world. Horrible horrible airport. If your are traveling true or to FLR never check your bag in. I hate this place.,1
Small Airport but the ways are really confusing. The security checks are a bit over tthe top when flying in the EU.,2
"WORST AIRPORT EVER! DO NOT FLY OUT OF OR LAND INTO THIS AIRPORT!!! Due to low staffing customer service is TERRIBLE!!! I lost my luggage at this airport. I filed a lost and found report and I was told I would receive the luggage within 24 hours and that it would be delivered to my location. Luckily I had an AirTag in my checked suitcase and it told me that my luggage arrived at the airport later in the day on the same day I arrived. I called the lost and found multiple times and they never answered. I emailed lost and found and the inbox is full. I went back to the airport the next to get my luggage and they told me that I couldn’t have it because it hadn’t been processed yet due to lack of staffing and computer technical difficulties. There were 15 plus people waiting at the post and found office for their luggage from this airport, and no one came to the window. People left this airport in tears due to not having their luggage given to them. Hundreds of people have lost their luggage at this airport and have waited 5 plus days to get their personal belongings after being told that it would take less than two days for arrival. ALWAYS CHECK AIRPORT REVIEWS BEFORE YOU TRAVEL TO THEM!",1
"The special assistance staff here are awesome! I tore my Achilles and needed wheelchair assistance. The attendant was super friendly and all of the other airport staff, especially the desk agents at KLM, were very helpful!",5
"This airport would be better if there were more restaurants, cafes and shops. The room that we waited for our gate also got packed and there wasn’t a single empty seat (luckily we had seats and worked on our laptops, but their wifi never worked).",3
"Lost my bag during transit to Florence? It's not their fault. However, my bag was sent to this airport on the same evening but it took them days to retrieve it. My bag has been sitting on the tarmac for days. They didn't show me the compassion to look for my bag when was simply sitting on the tarmac area. I even showed them the location of my Airtag but it diden's help. When I passed by the Tarmac, they had 3 times as many bags sitting outdoor than the lost and found office area that I took a picture of. Speaking of Lost and Found, airlines here don't have dedicated baggage service at this airport regardless of which airline that you travel with. Any bags lost will need to deal with the airport lost and found instead of your airlines' baggage service. Good luck traveling here. Or don't come here. Land in Rome instead as it's a bigger airport with hopefully, more efficient service.",1
"Easy jet lost my luggage over 2 weeks ago. They sent it to Florence airport,I’ve been trying to get in contact with this airport and no one responds. I’ve called lost and found over 25 times and it always says they are busy. I waited till 8:00am on the dot to call since that’s when they open and it already said they are full. No one at this airport answers the phone. The number they have for customer service does not work! Horrible customer service they can’t even answer the phone.",1
"Not a great airport. The good thing: it's quite fast when your just having hand baggage. The toilets were quite dirty, the rental car shuttle bus kept us waiting for approximately 20 min. Would have loved a shorter frequency to get faster to the rental car offices. Could be quite improved in my opinion",3
"Forexchange here is pure robbery and scam. Only place at the airport to do your VAT tax. They charge over a 20% fee and then claim they can't give you Euro's back and you have to accept a different currency - which they give you a terrible exchange rate on as well. We got maybe 50-60% of the value of our VAT tax back. Absolute scam. Airport is pretty brutal overall as well. Try doing your VAT tax in the City, avoid Forexchange at all costs!",1
"Unorganised, unfriendly and extremely slow groundstaff. We had to stand in queue for ages, only to learn that our flight will not depart in time because of wind.

After a replacement flight, we were informed that they never loaded our luggage onto the airplane. Also they didnt scan it properly at the airport. This means that we now have no idea where our suitcase is at this moment.",1
"Most unhelpful staff I have ever met in any airport across the world. Rude, do not care about practical difficulties for passengers and outrightly refuse to help. Would avoid booking flights from here.",1
"Pretty like this airport, not so crowed. Claim tax refund is totally no need to wait.",4
"Disappointing airport for such an amazing city and country. What is missing is a proper place for a coffee, not the rip off places they have now allowed to operate. Paid 20 euro for mediocre(cold) panini and glass of wine. A shame really.",1
"Really bad airport experience, a lot of delays and no information given to passengers. Almost no staff around the gates.",1
"Our flight was cancelled. 120people need to wait in line. The managing personnel is left us there. Nobody gives infornation. Thx austrian airlines

Btw the checking in also took one hour. The whole structure of the airport is messy.

I recommend anybody to us Pisa or Bologna airport and come here with train.",1
"Again a so called local airport with endles que-lines : Drop-off, security, check-in… endless. Forced way ONLY trough so called taxfree when you’re in a hurry.  NO SMOKING ANYWHERE 😡!  At the gate (1) endless STANDING queuing/waiting spce!
Horible! VIP Room fine and clean but not luxurious.",1
"We are frequent international travelers and have never experienced such rude airport staff and slow counters at any other airports. First our flight was cancelled and the staff was not willing to work with us. In their words “their option is the only option .. take it or book everything to the other part of the world on your own expense” when we agreed to their option we were put in a hotel 15 miles outside Florence with no proper restaurants or cafeterias near by for two days. We gave up after one day and moved to the hotel in city next day on our own expense.
We arrived at the gate of our rescheduled flight only to find more rude people which felt offensive to me. They forced us to check in our standard size carry-on. We took stuff in hand from three carry-ons and they were allowed to go with us.. basically we kept everything back in bags and easily put the carryons in the designated space.
All this to just prove that they are in-charge and can ask people to do what they desire.
We had a long flight with two little kids. We were carrying some stuff that might be needed on a 24 hour flight with kids.
It seems racist and stereotypical to me.
After a wonderful trip to Italy.. it was an absolute worst good bye to the people visiting your country and bringing money to your place.",1
"Very dirty airport, bathrooms are disgusting. Super unorganized when it comes to gates. Also do NOT do your Vat refund here. They make you go to an exchange counter, charge you 19.99% for the transaction and only give you 50% of your actually Vat value. The staff is also very rude. Avoid Florence airport and train to and from Florence instead.

This is my second experience and both times terrible.",1
"Small airport, passengers are bused to the plane, using stairs to get on the plane, it got us to Frankfurt for our international flight back home",4
Very small Airport. They lost our luggage because they can't fly big plans into the airport. Would not fly into Florence again,2
"Best airport I have ever been too. I am from Florence and travel a lot and here we consistently meet very nice helpful staff, that goes beyond its duties to help.
Never found this service in any other airport",5
Terrible!   Luggage check was unbelievably slow. Arrive very early is able.  We waited 15 mins per person/family while in line.  I was way too sober for this type of interaction.  Self baggage check was inoperable. A lot of chaos with the workers.,1
"An embarrassment for Italy. So badly designed. Long queues, zero logic with respect to passenger flow. One staff member for each checkin. 1 hour wait there, then another massive queue mess at security. Absolutely 3rd world. A stain on your country!",1
"I am begging the people of Italy to take one for the team and work at this airport. Very nice place, clean, friendly people, great food. I only give this three stars because they had one girl doing literally everything- she was baggage check, border police AND Air France representative and I feel bad for her. Someone come help her, she deserves it.  I am once again asking the people of Italy to work at this airport. Friends, Romans (Italians), Countrymen, lend me your ears!",3
"Overcrowded, understaffed, and unsanitary (no soap available in the bathrooms). Long waits to get any food or water (vending machines and water dispensers are all broken). And nowhere near enough seats or capacity for the amount of people and flights they are trying to accommodate. Absolute disaster.",1
"There is no infrastructure in this airport:
* There are probably enough seats for 30% of the people that pass by the airport during the afternoon, therefore be prepared to sit in the floor and wait.
* The air conditioner is not very good, so if it's a hot day, be prepared for the heat inside.
* If your flight is late (it probably will), be prepared to be threat even worst, and wait standing up on a crowded area for a long time.

Conclusion: do you want to get out of Florence? Get the train",1
"Very convenient airport, in that it is in a good location to the city. Security line was quick and the duty free shop is nice. However, the amenities are lacking. There is very little seating and dining in the airport and does not make for a pleasant experience when you are waiting for your flight. There were only two open places to get drinks and food once inside, and both have very minimal seating. There are no drinking fountains and the only way to fill up your water bottle is in the bathroom. Everyone is very packed in here which is not an ideal experience.",2
"Massively understaffed. Unhelpful staff. Completely disorganised. Toilets disgusting. Almost nowhere to get food or drink, apart from vending machines that don't work. Huge queues for checkin as very few staff, dozens of empty checkin desks. No self-checkin.

Overwhelmingly awful experience. And this was just on a regular day with no delays. As a neruo diverse person with sensory difficulties, I desperately needed some help, but virtually no-one was there at checkin (where most of the problems appeared to be), and the only person I could find did not want to know.",1
The worst airport in Italy? Literally no cell service inside the building. There is Wi-Fi but it’s broken big surprise. Flights are constantly delayed canceled and the workers could care less. Impossible to get a taxi. Do yourself a favor and avoid.,1
"Very disappointing! On this airport are working talians with the highest level of incompetence and unfriendliness I have ever seen... Due to their attitude and work ethic, baggage drop off takes longer than an hour, everything else gets delayed. By the way, I usually really love Italy and everything works somehow but this today was really not necessarily, and very disappointing.",1
"The airport it’s not bad. The staff are quick. The airport is quite small though and I believe at least 85% of travellers are rocking a low-grade fever. No one wears a a masks and cough openly.

*Edit* our flight is now delayed. The reason being, they still waiting for it to arrive. Yet alone the time to refuel and unload baggage.",1
"Small, crowded and outdated. Absolutely horrible airport, probably the worst I’ve been at. Power went out a lot. People are sitting at the floors.

If you expect the usual big city airport, don’t expect it.

I guess it’s okay for arrivals since it’s only 20 minutes from city centre for €1,50.",1
"Giant queues (one hour to check in), packed everywhere, overpriced food and not enough seating.    Most flights were delayed.  It was extremely chaotic.  On the plus side, it is close to the centre and costs €1.50 to get there by tram.",2
"Although, not the airports fault for my flight getting canceled there was no seats for my wife and my daughter to sit in while we waited 6 hours . Finally we get through security and enter the VIP lounge to find no seats there also. Inside there is no AC so it’s also extremely hot inside.",2
Airport is way too small to handle all the departing passengers. No Air-conditioning and fresh airflow inside terminal.,1
"Regional airport, good for short hops around Europe. For some reason most flights are delayed without explanation. The gates are all super close together since you take a bus to your aircraft.",3
"You've been warned - there are valid reasons why this airport is so poorly reviewed. Incompetent staff and frequently canceled flights due to local weather and the short runway. If you're looking for a way to ruin your vacation, try flying out of FLR.

Rome and Milan are far more reliable int'l airports and only 2 hours away by comfortable, high speed train. Take your business elsewhere!",1
"unbelievable slow 🐌
Possibly just KLM
they have  definitely gone downhill",1
"This Airport has very limited seating. Due to this people are sitting everywhere and anywhere, which makes it hard to get around.
Parts of the Airport do not have air conditioning.
The whole experience is unpleasant due to no seating, no air conditioning and the high volumes of people in such a small space.",1
"Small airport, seemed like the majority of flights were delayed by a few hours (including mine). Not much to do before boarding or many places to eat so bring a book and a snack lol. Didn’t see anywhere to fill up my water bottle besides the bathroom. Not much seating.

However, found charging ports built into some seats which was convenient, and the staff member I spoke to when I had some questions about my flight was extremely friendly and helpful :) Check in and security was very quick (less than 10 minutes to get through both) although I was there 2 hours early.",3
"I highly recommend not to fly to or from this airport. Airlines book the flights full, but can allmost never take a full flight because of the short runway (1560meter / 5118ft). A little change of wind and your of the flight togetter with 20 others. Airport facilities and personal are not great eather. I dont write reviews normaly, but for this one i make an exception.",1
"Consistently a nightmare, if you are lucky you survive it without major hiccups. Check-in experience is terrible, long lines, rude staff. Arrival experience is even worse, long delays, no fingers to deplane. Whoever is running this (and honestly most of the people who work there) should be ashamed. Ugh.",1
"Getting to this airport from the center of Firenze, by taxi, takes 20 min early morning, and about twice as long in rush hour traffic. Small airport, moving through security to the gates was quick. Very few food choices, but Tuscan sandwiches are delicious. Restrooms could be cleaner.",4
"There is a lack of working plugs: not even a plug on tables, and the few ones on chairs are not working",3
"Got here at 7 am to ensure we would be able to get to the Lost and Found before my sister’s flight (leaving at 10am). This lost and found is only open from 8am until 9am for some reason. We know the bag is here because the Venice airport sent it here, instead of sending it to the address she designated on the form they gave her. My sister was the first in line. The woman working here opened, my sister said “My bag was sent here by the Florence airport, here are the forms,” and the woman then said that because she was the only person working, she could not help anyone and shut the entire office at 8:01am. We were left completely confused. Why was only one person working. She had a conversation with another woman in Italian who said that the woman working was rude, but that she seemed overworked and overwhelmed. The woman posted this note on the window and closed. About 15 minutes later another man showed up to get his lost luggage. We told him what happens and he said that this was the third time the exact same thing had happened to him. Completely unprofessional for this airport to operate this way. There needs to be at least two staff members at lost and found. My sister had a flight, but the woman said she might come back later. My sister has designated me to get her bag if she cannot because I have a later flight. We will see if it works.",1
"Really bad airport experience, a lot of delays and no information given to passengers. Almost no staff around the gates.",1
"Horrible airport, rude service, I've never seen an airport that closes at midnight and flights start at 5 am!  Me like thousands of other people, had to wait outside the airport.  The hotels are very expensive and there is no transport that takes you to the airport.  If you're thinking of coming to Florence airport, don't waste your time ,go to Rome or any other airport, it's worth your time and money.",1
Basically a small regional airport it copes quite well but there are very limited eating options once you are airside. It's main advantage is its closeness to the centre of Florence.,3
"Hopelessly overcrowded… only 10% of the passengers can sit, and even standing room is scarce.",2
train T2 is very convenient,4
"PMR assistance / they were amazing 👍 very respectful and gentle. Grazie 🥰

Update on the way back : how devoted and human the staff is, Firenze airport has a lot to teach to bigger airports 👏",5
"Clean, polite staff, easy to get in and through security. Nice amenities too for shopping (Ferragamo!!)",5
"Bag with all my clothes and medicine was lost during connection flight so had to open lost bag claim. The line to submit lost bag claim took 3 hours (and it only got longer after I got in line).

After submission, never received any updates about bag for 5 days, turns out bag and contact info were entered incorrectly into the lost bag site.
Eventually had to go back to the airport and ask to check lost and found myself. It was directly behind their desk and had been for at least 2 days…

Giving 2 stars instead of 1 only because many of the other staff were very friendly and helpful",2
small and easy with 3 belts but the custom police don’t speak english,4
"Bulk standard small regional airport. Staff at immigration control were polite. Landed and exited. Easy reach to tram service which takes 20 or so minutes to get to centre of Florence. €1.70 for a ticket. Good value, frequent service.",3
"Airport for ""big brand"" air companies (alitalia, klm, etc.), while the airport of Pisa targets the low cost flights. Currently, the airport is not well connected with florence (no train connections, buses from the railwaystation SMN).
The Security check was fast.
Restaurant with glutenfree food.
Poor internet connection for free.",3
Air Dolomiti and this airport are the worst. Don’t expect ANY help if they lose a bag. They will not help you in any way except to give you your lost baggage form and show you the door. Good luck.,1
"Terrible experience. On most museum tours everything ends in the gift shop and this airport is no different. After security you have to run a very long gauntlet of gift shops before getting to the gate area. The seating area in the gate area is limited, loud and hot. Take out some of those overpriced gift shops and give the space back to the waiting area. Check-in counters are only staffed at the last moment, truly a poor experience. For the most expensive option getting to Florence you would expect better. Most of the reasonable flights from the US end in Pisa with a 60/min train ride to Florence. Next time I'll fly into Pisa instead of Florence.",2
"The worst airport i’ve ever seen! I am waiting for the ITA Roma flight check-in desk line with the all other passengers who are going with other airlines to other directions. Just chaos, unorganized, please take a trainf from Florence if it is an option. I will not come here again",1
"The Florence airport is a dump. Little waiting area, few offerings if youre looking for a meal, poorly kept bathrooms, spotty wifi and a winding maze to walk through to get to your flight. Florence deserves better than this crap-port.",1
"This is a small airport with very few direct flights to other destinations. No big planes land here and therefore big dogs cannot use this airport to travel because their crates do not fit inside the cargo. Also, the airport is outdated, the bathrooms need to be cleaned more often and provided with toilet paper and soap.
There are not enough seats. Most people have to stand up or sit on the floor while waiting to board.
There are very few places to buy something to eat or drink and the selection is poor.
God forbid your luggage doesn't arrive with you because the process to recover it  is slow and painful due to the poor organization and lack of efficiency of the airport staff.",1
"Flight took off an hour late because luggage handlers were ""too short staffed"" to load the luggage on the airplane. Missed connections, stuck in Europe for an extra day.",1
"If I could go below zero stars I would. Hands down the worst airport I’ve ever been to. The airport is very understaffed. There were only 4 open checking windows in the whole airport. An hour and a half passed by and passed by and the line wasn’t even long. And that’s not even the worst of it I stood up to go to the line once the gate was open. It was 17:45 at the time and my flight to Vienna was supposed to take off at 18:25. From the moment the line was formed until 20:05 not one passenger was on board of the flight. And if you ask
the staff. They tell you that there is no staff available to check your documents after you get off from the bus. So basically we’ve been waiting for 2h30 because of staff vacancy.

Avoid it if possible.",1
Nice smaller city airport! Excellent food!,5
"Not big, but good enough. Doing some construction around. Not many places to eat good Italian food.",3
Literally the worst airport I've ever been to. 8 seats in the waiting hall followed by 2 hrs in line to drop off bags with the most inefficient system I've ever seen. All this followed by the most overcrowded stuffy non air conditioned gate possible. As Ia finally memory of florence really not fantastic.,1
I flew out of this airport a few days ago on a 6:45am Vueling Airlines flight. I’m happy to report that the airport was calm and the line up for security dissipated after Security Screening opened at 4:30 am. None of our checked luggage was left behind or lost. Looks like things have improved at this airport since reviews from a few weeks ago.,4
Small but efficient airport. Good staff ratio,4
"Complete disaster of an airport, travelled in June but I doubt it has improved judging from the recent reviews.

Very run down, understaffed, a very underwhelming lack of shops, restaurants/cafes or amenties, the toilets were not great.

But my major issue was no seats!! Especially if you're made to wait hours for a delayed flight, there wasn't anywhere to seat once a crowd of people came along.

And to ascertain information about which gate to go is a mystery, and to find the gate number and how it is all organised is dreadful.

Both ways, going into italy and out of italy, there were only 2 people checking the passport which took forever.

Maybe I would fly into the airport as the experience was mediocre and the queue to get out was frustrating, however flying out from the airport was god awful,a abysmal shambles of epic proportions.

Anyone reading this, good god please go to Pisa if you plan on flying out.",1
"If you have a chance to avoid this airport, use it. I supposed to have a flight with KLM today from this airport. In the beginning, when we arrive the staff rejected to get our luggage because they don't know how to manage luggage for two flights with the same destination. When we reach the head of the queue again an hour later, they informed us that it is likely we cannot fly out because it is a hot day and they had to cut the number of the passengers on the flight and we have to wait half an hour for the further details. When you try to get any clarification, some staff member started yelling at the passengers (hi Debora and her blond hair colleague sitting next to her).

In the end, after about 2 hours of waiting, ten of us were informed  that we definitely stay in Italy tonight and we will flight from Bologna tomorrow. The hotel is provided but we were waiting in this tiny airport for three hours.

I enjoyed my time in Florence but was extremely upset by the disgraceful customer service at the airport today.",1
"Uncomfortable, very little space to wait quietly. Noisy, either freezing airco or not at all. Food options are very limited. No easy access to drinkable water, I was sent to the lavatories, where they indeed put a sign saying it's drinkable (lukewarm) water. Boarding is messy as there are no clear lines for boarding groups.",2
"Hello!
Very clean and beautiful airport and nice security service and health care for COVID-19.
Thanks GOD I reached on my destination comfortably.",5
Way too small to handle the crowd. The short runway can cause problems like a rough landing or the need to divert if the plane can’t take off with enough fuel,1
"We arrived Saturday morning at 05:10 .
It took us almost 40 minutes to pass the line and check in. Maybe there were to many airplane departures at the same time and not enough personnel at the luggage drop off.

Also the water vending machines did not accept any credit cards. (Maybe their network was down). We didn't carry any money with us. So we had to wait on another line just to get some water.

Other than that the installation was OK.",3
"Very dirty toilets
Took staff 1 hour to check the first 10 pax for our flight
Very very great shortage of seats before and after security
Catering however very nice!",1
"Ridiculous. My flight got cancelled, which is of course not the problem of the airport. But organizing how to handle 100 people whose flight just got cancelled should be. There were 5 people sitting in the checkin kiosk, but only 2 were helping us, the rest was sitting aroind doing nothing. 50 people in, 1 of the ones that was helping us went home...",1
Very crowded airport that was not marked well.  It was so hot inside I was in a full sweat.  Our flight was delayed due to not having a bus to take us out to our plane.,3
"Fight KL1644 to Amsterdam 28 August, lady at the gate, lazy and making up excuses not to do what she could easily do.
The plane was very dirty, the ground staff didn't do their job, food still on the seats.... Maybe management is reading",2
"Very small with no air conditioning, all good and drink outlets had long queues. Security checks were excellent, Heathrow could learn from them.",3
Had two pieces of luggage go missing in this poor excuse of an airport. Waited almost 2 hours in the Lost and Found line because of general staff inefficiency and all the side conversations they were having.  Both self help kiosks were not operational. Barely given any information about the missing baggage process from the employee “helping” us. It’s been 3 days now and I still don’t have my baggage. Cannot get a hold of anyone who works at this phone to tell them the AirTag in my bag says it is in Florence now. Should be ashamed of their service. Poor excuse for an airport. Stop pretending and just tell people you don’t care if they don’t have a decent experience in Italy. 0 stars,1
"Worst airport ever. It is closed at night up to 4am, so if you have a connection flight you have to wait outside.",1
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THEY CLOSE THE AIRPORT FROM 12:30 AM to 4:00 AM!!!!! do not try to book early morning flights and catch the train to stay overnight at this airport because you will be stranded in florence like me overnight.,1
"Horrible service, rude staff and long queues. Very small and with not much to do before boarding. The only vending machine available was 90% empty AND BROKEN (without any sign).

It felt as if there were no staff members… the lady who took our luggage then handled the boarding. Everything took a very long time and the flight was severly delayed.",1
"This is a trash heap of an airport. Zero accessibility for handicap or infants. No changing tables in the bathrooms. Poor customer service and communication. Avoid this airport at all costs. You would be better off taking a train from another city to avoid unnecessary issues. Partner airlines are not helpful, you will be bounced between desks and ""customer service"" but no one will attempt to help, just shift blame and give you the run-around.",1
"Small airport, security experience was good. Had to bus from terminal to get on plane. Several places to get food and drinks while waiting, had a little trouble with getting my items as I don’t speak Italian, but we were able to make it through. I’ve been to several airports and this one is among the top better airports on my list.",4
"One of the best regional airports I've ever flown in or out of. The terminals are very clean, lots of phone chargers, plenty of food choices and you don't have to walk a mile to get a taxi. The staff is very helpful and courteous.",5
Flight at 6am..... Airline advises to get there at least 3.5 hours before but it doesn't open until 4am!!! People sleeping outside on the floor. What a joke!!!,1
"I travelled in August 2022 from here and I was not looking forward to it, based on horror stories I had read online through reviews and articles.

For us however it was fine, we went through security quickly, had a drink at the cafe (playing seemingly inappropriate music for an airport cafe) before making our way down to the boarding gates, it was all very well organised and quite a cute small airport to travel from.",5
It was small but efficient. Had to walk down stairs from aircraft and onto bus. Bus took us to the terminal baggage claim. No issues at all.,4
"Airport staff stopped me (3 times in 3 trips) to check additional documents and covid pass (even if not required to travel within EU). Today at the check in security check the woman removed the box with my items from the conveyor when i passed under the metal detector to let me wait 10 minutes until i realized what she did (intentionally), what a shame. I will avoid this airport in the future.

UPDATE: Im flying to BOLOGNA airport now, you can easily reach a lot of places from here and its fast also for rental cars! No more stupid shuttle",1
If you're flying in Florence FLR expect at least 50 min to get your checked in bags... It's unbelievable how slow they are every single time...,1
Small but efficient airport. Less crowded than big ones and usually with short cues and quick check-in/security check/boarding services. More shops and bars in the boarding areas would be appreciated.,4
"FLR Airport Flight cancelation heaven.  Arriving from the USA flight was rerouted to Pizza.  Flying out flight delayed for 2 hours then canceled.  Rescheduled for 2 days later put in a hotel.  Airline chanced my flight again without consulting me with a 2 hour notice via email the day before I was scheduled the first time.  As I sit waiting to board, 5 flights are canceled.  Don’t ever fly to or from Florence.  First flights leave at 6:40 am. Tram va 2 doesn’t start trips to the airport until 5am. 20 min trip. That leaves you about an hour to check in. Window attendants short handed. Long lines. Carry one very limited in size.  Will never do it again.  I’d rather take a train to Rome Airport. And avoid Amsterdam airport at all costs.     Dec. 1, 2022.",1
The staff was exceptionally helpful and efficient. All were very welcoming.,5
"This is literary a dump! No aircon, no power plugs working, wifi extremely slow (0.8 Mbps), not enough seats to accommodate all the  passengers, toilets dirty...",1
"The worst airport I ever seen. Open at 4 am, shuttle from rental car parking starts at 5 am. If you have more luggage you can lose the flight. No walking area from rental car parking to the airport, walking with luggage in the night is enough danger. Unbelievable...",1
"Really bad experience, if you want to visit Tuscany It Will be Better going to Pisa Airport, take Pisa Mover and than the train of Trenitalia to Florence. It is small and bad organized, in the gates there were too much people waiting and the air was suffocating, the charging station are not working and there were delay not only in my flight to Pisa with Vueling but with all the other flights of the day. A lots of turists confused by the bad organization and the information given by the speaker. This Airport gaves a really bad images to all people working in the tourism field, to Florence and Tuscany!",1
"Be careful this airport closes at night from 12.00 - 04.00.

Also there was a taxi strike so i had to go on foot. Gladly because i couldn't stay at the airport i booked a hotel nearby (3km).

I had a morning flight (06.15) and that was horrible. Only 3 windows open for EVERYONE. I got there at 04.30 but they started to board at 06.10. This whole time i was standing in line. It was too stressful that I would call acceptable.

Also there were a lot of people crying that their flight was cancelled also people whose baggage was stolen or didn't arrive. Those people are everywhere but i've never seen so many upset people.

I was in Florence during 2 events: Fashion Week and Rock Ferenza. The city was overflowed.",1
I love this small airport.  It is so easy to navigate,5
"A very small but very good airport. It's very clean, the staff is friendly and you can follow the signs very easily. Free wifi everywhere in the airport, there are many toilets but they are still pretty clean.",5
"This review relates to Lost & Found (lost baggage). Firstly I understand the staff are under a lot of pressure with many lost bags, however, my wife went to look for our bags (which were confirmed to have been received at the airport), there was a lot of bags in an outdoor area and two other bag rooms that they showed her and the bags were nowhere to be found. Many other people were in a similar situation and ultimately just left thinking their bags were not there.

My wife stuck around and tried to speaking with someone to try to get to the bottom of it. The employees were very rude and dismissive of her, trying to get her to leave. Only after complaining for 15 minutes did they finally take her to ANOTHER area with HUNDREDS of additional bags. Sure enough our bags were there.

When asked why they didn’t take us there to look for bags, someone just said “oh these are old bags” (wrong our bags were there only 2 days). This is just a note for anyone with a lost bag to make sure they take you to all the areas and don’t leave until you find it.",1
"it is important to be consistent in naming the airport, otherwise it’s confusing for tourists. it is Peretola airport in my boarding pass, but the map only gives me Amerigo Vespuci airport. i thought my train was heading to the wrong airport, not a pleasant feeling.",1
"The literal worst airport I've ever step foot into. Avoid traveling through here if necessary, especially if you have a connecting flight because you WILL miss it due to their incompetence. You are not allowed to check in until about ~2 hours before your departure. Due to this, long lines will start to gather as everyone with flights around the same time wait to enter the line to check in. Then the check-in lines drag on for hours because there are only two people working at a snail pace to check people in. I was stuck at this airport for two days in a row and BOTH days I witnessed various flights being delayed because of the absurd length of time it took for everyone to check in. It didn't just happen to us, but many people around us, as well. And they do not care. Bring up any concern to them and they will not help you. One lady reasonably expressed her concern of not getting to her flight on time because of the incredibly long lines and the male check-in agent basically laughed in her face and waved her off. Rude and incompetent staff except for the lovely ladies at the information desk downstairs. Would give 0 stars if I could, do not travel through here!!",1
"The airport is not big enough for the amount of people travelling. Not enough seating and unfortunately almost no food choices. Anyway, friendly staff!",2
Always needed to take the Shuttle to go to any car rental,4
"Italy....it is just not able to do any better. Oh wait....squeezing money out from tourists, dolce vita!

Normal people would be ashamed when turning up for ""work"" there, but not a thing for hard chilling Italians as it seems.

What a whole...",1
"It's a small airport, so there is limited seating and eating places. Saying that we were processed really quickly and it is only a 30 min tram ride (€1.50) from the city centre.",4
"The lost and found center is literally never available and there is no way to talk to a human on the phone. My baggage has not arrived and I want to know when I can get it, if at all, but nobody wants to help",1
"Hi,

My AirPods got stolen from my luggage and I’m able to track where they are. This has been done by someone from luggage service. I don’t care about the AirPods but PLEASE do something about the person that leaves at “Viale Manfredo Fanti 229”. This is were my AirPods are. The Florence Airport deserves better personnel.

Best Regards,
Pedro.",1
"Overcrowded, understaffed, check in desk employees chatting and laughing with each other while there is a long line. Boarding pass from checking in online did not work. All flights delayed without explanation. Waiting in a bus without AC on a hot summer day. On top of it all, lost our bags. Avoid this airport.",1
"Overall not great - Overcrowded, poor climate control, dirty. Gates seem to all have buses rather than walkways to plane.",2
A very efficient airport 🛫  excellent coordination in transferring flights ✈️ when the weather means you have to fly from another airport due to safety conditions taking off vs the weather 😀,5
"My recommendation is to minimise the time you need to be here as much as possible. It is overcrowded with nowhere to sit or be. Everything is extremely over priced.  We got here 4 hours early, but next time would not arrive more than 2 hours before the flight. Coke Zero 450ml bottle €3.60. Squeezing the tourists for every penny.",1
"We were supposed to have a flight with KLM from Florence to Amsterdam on 18/7 at 12.10 in the afternoon. The staff at the check-in desks 22-25 didn't give us boarding passes and refused to take our luggage. The representative, Deborah, explained that due to the hot weather and a short runway,+37 in July in Florence, a captain needs to make the technical calculation regarding the flight. We tried to find out more information about this flight. Deborah became irritative and avoided saying anything else. We asked for a manager. In a few minutes, Deborah and the colleague sitting next to her started yelling at my husband and me. They raised from the working chairs and started gesticulating. Well, that was quite terrifying. The manager came to us and said there was nothing they could do about the flight and that we should have not upset her staff. We had to wait another hour to hear that people with the final destination in Amsterdam had been denied boarding. Our KLM plane flew with people who had connecting flights and sky priority. Then, the staff at the check-in desk finished their work and left. There was no one around to give us any support or solution in this situation. After some time a man came and gave us the vouchers for food and compensation. It took three hours for the airport to organise a bus to the hotel in Bologna. We flew out from Bologna Airport on next morning.
I would recommend the manager of the check-in desk to arrange a custom service and anger management training for the previously mentioned representatives. Also, KLM and this airport need to reorganise the hours for the flight when it is not too hot(early mornings and late nights). Otherwise, they give us misleading information by selling the flight tickets they know are unlikely to fly out.",1
"The airport is in front of a mountain and it can be very dangerous to take off and land, so if there is even a little bit of wind it will be chaos. In the years I've:
- seen half of the passengers denied boarding at the gate because the plane was too heavy
- seen the luggages of the whole plane being left on the ground and lost (including mine)
- been redirected to take off or land in bologna or pisa countless times
- departed or landed with long delays because the wind made it too dangerous

Nearly half of the times there was an issue. Do yourself a favor and use a serious airport, not this joke.",1
"Definitely the worst things I had to see in my whole life, hate them",1
"Disorganized, multiple flights delayed by slow check in of passengers causing a domino effect. Once finally on board after boarding three hours late, we waited on a bus for 20 min to drive less than 100'.  Then once on the aircraft we sat on the runway another hour, simply to have to turn back to the terminal.",1
"Cute small airport. Barely any wait. At least when I went. I noticed a train station next to the airport.  That's nice.
But my bad experience was returning the car rental at night.  Nobody is at the location and u have to find where to return the car, drop off the keys in a box, and then find ur way back to the airport.  Because shuttle don't start until 5am.
A few Americans were lost together at the rental place...  We were going to walk back to the airport on the highway, but someone called a taxi. It was $30 euros for a 4 minute drive.  Taxis took advantage of the situation but it had to be done or we all would've missed our flight waiting for shuttle at 5am.

Airport experience was great except return car in the middle of the night.",4
"I understand many complaints around it: delayed flights, long queues, tiny spaces. At the same time I use it for work and I experiences such short inbound and outbound times that I barely can find anywhere else. All the complaints should focus on the cities around Florence which keep refusing the new airport project: what else can we do?",4
"Main strength is access by tram T2 from Florence for €1.50 in 20 minutes.
Limited duty free range, but good online system for pre-order & collect.
Limited and crowded cafe before security, with grumpy staff. Better to use much better one airside.",4
"Quite a small terminal to get out of. A 2 minute bus ride from the plane, followed by waiting for luggage and a quick exit. The tram station is also close by. All in all 5-10 minutes experience.",5
"Avoid at all costs. Flight was switched last minute to Pisa which was also horrible. Place was small, cramped, smelly and hot/humid. There was no announcement that our flight was switched to Pisa. Avoid.",1
"Florence is my favorite city in the world but their airport is an absolute nightmare. Do not even think about flying into this airport unless you are only taking a carry-on bag. If you're checking luggage, you'd be better off just throwing it in the bin before getting on your plane because at least then you would know where it was. The lost and found baggage dept works laughable hours making it impossible to get your luggage. The workers also have a very poor attitude and almost seem upset that you're asking them for help. Trust me, you're better off flying into Milan or Rome and then taking a train to Florence rather than dealing with this awful airport.",1
"The air company lost my suitcase. A worker in lost in found has told me that it is in Rome and will arrive within 2 days. It has been 2 days. Suitcase is not here. And I cannot even get in touch with LOST AND FOUND offices. Not through email. And when I call them, I get the response that they r still searching for my baggage.",1
"DO NOT FLY WITH VUELING...PLEASE!
I'm stranded in Florence because of Vueling's strange way of profiling passengers for boarding. BEWARE, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
Update: spent 25 hours, with no hotel rooms offered, this was an awful experience. Please, do not use this airport or airline, i understand the weather element affecting flights but the way we were treated is unacceptable. Vueling, if you want to contact us for the whole story please do.",1
"3 weeks trying to contact the handling department to locate my baggage they’ve lost, without any success. I’ve tried by phone (they work 2h a day), by contact form en email (not responding).

I’ve provided all kind of information about the suitcase and there is still no response.",1
There’s only one person to process hundreds of people checking in. Not only that but if you want to get your tax refund and your item is in checked bag you get the delight of waiting in that line twice or making the decision whether or not you want to give up your money. Seems by design to me so that you can’t get your money back. Worst airport I have visited in my life.,1
Quick and easy access with taxi or tram from the city center. Inside the airport there are many shops (for such a small airport) and also seating while waiting for the departure.,5
"I only arrived at the airport but I absolutely loved it! Cute and cosy, very different from the usually very large airports in capital cities. Makes you feel more connected to your fellow travellers. 3 tiny baggage carousels in the little one room arrivals wing. Hilarious that they put us on a bus to travel 50 metres from the aircraft to the arrivals gate! The terminal is small so naturally your options for food etc will be limited if you're departing but I had a great short visit. Would love to fly into this airport again :)",5
"Terrible, extremely long wait times, ridiculous positioning of the car rental deposit and zero communication or information after sitting here with a cancelled flight for an hour. And this isn't the first time. Will never fly from here again.

Coffee is good though, must admit.",1
Very overcrowded and hot airport with no air conditioning and not enough seating for all of the people. Security was efficient.,2
"Honestly terrible, small, disorganised, and badly thought out. As an example gates have seating for 1/10th of the aircraft. Toilets in a terrible state and very dirty. Speaker system is louder than standing next to the jets themsleves. On the up side i was able to buy a bottle of water from a vending machine (as most of the food places closed at lunchtime).",1
Weird little airport but overall not bad,4
"Small airport, entry point to Tuscany.
Security line is well organized.
Clean but seriously lacking some chairs in the waiting rooms.",4
"Absolute chaos with poor signage and a dodgy check system. There were massive queus for check that were not moving. Not a place to check in luggage.
Security was quick but did not seem thorough as I saw one person go through the metal detector it went red they were waved on.",1
Most horrible experience ever. Waiting luggage for 1 hour and 20 min. When asking staff about it they just closed the counter. Later shouted at us (whole plane full of people) and said that if we dont like something then we can go outside to service center to compliance. The service desk was unmanned... just riddiculous,1
"I have no idea what they were thinking with this airport. It es extremely disorganized and underdeveloped. It would make it much better if they installed a few signs explaining where the gates are…etc. insane agglomerations,  there were so many people where you wait for boarding that we thought it was another passport control. On the positive side, you can take the T2 tram to the city and it is very close, fast, convenient and inexpensive.",1
I almost never give 1 star but this airport is embarrassing. If you can avoid using it do it. It is so unorganised and smells terrible.,1
"Worst airport I have experienced for quite a while. Delays, cancellations, loud discussions and no employees to guide it.

We came in early to find hundreds and hundreds of people standing in line, but no guidance for people and employees were completely unphazed, just ignoring people cutting in line.

Check in alone took 3.5 hrs for us but more for others, as many flights were in the same line (despite different departure times) and only 3 desks were open. Flight were delayed a couple hrs while others were cancelled, but no proper communication and everything was only heard from others or on the screens.

Frustrating day in here, for sure will not be going back to this Airport with so many others relatively close by.",1
"Small airport but clean and easy to go with. Only problem is the rental cars company not being in airport. You have to catch a free bus to go there.
Also funny fact, the plane must break harder than in other airports because the landing lane is smaller.",3
Path to departure gates zigzag up and down. Few places to sit. Even less places to line up at the gate when it's time to board. Delay was not updated on the departure screen.,1
"I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are about - this is as good as any small regional airport in the US. There are cafes before and after security and duty free shopping is available too. Getting through security was a breeze and the layout of the airport is very clear. The only issue is that most of the phone charging stations didn't seem to work, which is a shame since they are positioned everywhere.",4
"Worst airport I've ever been to. The one runway is too short and so with any amount of tail wind they will bump people from the flight. They bumped my wife and told her to take a bus to Bologna, causing her to miss her connection to USA. When she told them she would miss her connection in Paris they blamed her for not alerting them about the connection before they bumped her. do yourself a favor and fly elsewhere.",1
"No gluten free options to have a serious dinner. Just a bunch of cookies. We are 2023, wake up please",1
"Small but efficient. Taxi fare downtown 22 euros + 1 euro per bag, bus 6 euros (every hour on the hour) to the right from the exit. Tramway frequent, fare 1.5 euros. Kids up to 7 are not charged. Espresso 1.4 euros but go with double so you get 2 gulps.",5
Easy Airport to navigate. Security was a breeze,5
Flights are regularly cancelled or routed to different airports. Departure area is always crowded. No way to sit. It gets worse and worse.,1
"Scandal ! 1h30 to wait under the sun with a baby then 35 min to get the car. We had paid for everything in advance, including 100% insurance, which was expensive. We had two gold cards for the deposit and they made us pay 650€ more because they don't accept French visa-type cards (even though we had already rented in Florence from Sixt with the same card without problems), we will have paid a total of €1,659 for a Fiat panda over 10 days! We should have gone to Europcar or Sixt, the customers had their cars very quickly and in the end we would have had a station wagon or a 4x4 for the same price and without being ripped off and we would have been more polite, I think. We will spend the next two days going to all the sites and in all the languages ​​to protect people from going to Sicily, it's really a scam to avoid!!!!",1
"Five star airport, for me and my wife",5
"How can a region like Tuscany leaves such a huge airport without any serious investement ?!? Millions of tourists commute here every year : the slop is too short, the terminal is ridiculous, the car rental is a nightmare, the arrival of luggages is a joke, the lounge is a blind cheap and dirty corridor, the kiss and fly doesn’t exist, the freeway access to the airport is a small signal on the right…please INVEST",2
"I visited italy a few days back, flew into bologna where I had a very good experience from where I took a train to Florence. To make the way back more convenient I decided to fly out of Florence. Had a terrible experience at the airport. The security staff was EXTREMELY unfriendly and rude which completely ruined the whole experience for me. Other people were also very unsatisfied with the behaviour of the security crew. Nobody told me clearly what I had to take off (belt/jacket/shirt). So my shirt was still on after which the lady at security got mad and annoyed with me and gave me a really rude attitude. The only person at the airport that was really nice and friendly was the man that served me in the restaurant that looks out over the airport runway. I've flown from so many airports and some are better than others but this was definitely the worst experience I've had so far. It's a shame as the airport itself is convenient and modern but the attitude and behaviour of the security crew made me feel so unwelcome that I will definitely avoid this airport and never come back there again, and I'm sure others will too.",1
It was a nice experience. I was returning with an injury and I was actually spoiled!,5
"Pretty small airport.
Friendly people.
Nice coffee",5
"Plane canceled two minutes before time of boarding, almost no information on rebooking  and long lines. Almost no place to sit by the gate. If a little breeze is enough to cancel a plane they shouldn’t be able to use the airstrip. Not going to use this airport next time.",2
"Airport that closes at 1 am and opens at 4am (which central airport closes for 3 hours?!), no smoking spaces inside the airport, not many establishments for food or beverages. Definitely not a good airport, nowhere near Roma Fiumicino or other internationals airports...",2
"While the world tries to become more sustainable, at Peretola you take a bus for 150 meters to hop into a plane. The buses are always turned on and you wait 30 minutes in a bus which pollutes and makes you breathe exhaust gas as the doors are open. Unbelievable!!!!!",1
I can't really think of anything bad to say about this airport. It was exactly as you would expect a small regional airport to be. Staff were pleasant enough. Bags came quickly. Shuttle bus to city was easy to find.  would fly to or from here again happily.,5
"Small airport, yet popular destination, suffers from a lack of space and passenger facilities despite the renovations. The automated security is a total headache and in winter, with no jet bridges you may even disembark under a snow storm.",3
"Terrible customer service, tried to explain that I have a severe airborne peanut allergy to the staff at the desk and they accused me of lying! Very dangerous. Don't go here please fly to pisa instead",1
"This is a tiny, packed airport that does check in via downstairs shuttle; make sure to come early as sometimes if there is issue with your tickets it’s hard to get through to the counter without meeting a long line.

The airport is really small but not congested. There is a train right by the airport that takes you to the central city, however it doesn’t run 24/7, so if your flight is too early or late you are better off with a taxi.

Mostly recommended method is to leave or arrive during working hours. The train cost about 1,80$ or so, not a bad value for a train ride. The stops are really fast in hop on hop off, so make sure you aren’t sitting down if you are about to get off on the train.",4
"Arriving here is very nice.
Departing from here is pure hell. That thing is a small bus terminal handling hundreds and hundreds of passengers. If you’re lucky you find a place to sit on the floor.",1
Small airport and usually not crowded. Very clean and with enough facilities to spend a few hours. You can park the car for free for 10 minutes and it is close to Florence city center in taxi or bus.,5
"After waiting 45mins+ in the check in line, it seemed like everything was gong fine. Security was fast and easy, the gift shop was cool, but then it came time to board and we were informed that the baggage handlers went on strike.  Almost all the flights were cancelled and the few that were not were significantly delayed. In fact, I’m writing this review while waiting on the plane because I have PLENTY of time before we take off.

If you can, I would avoid using this airport unless you ABSOLUTELY have too.

Terrible smh",1
"Bagage took an hour to get. Everything here is super slow. Boarding an airplane takes at least 30 minutes. Low ceilings, crowded.",1
Not really sure why all the negative reviews about this airport. It's not too big which is kind of an advantage because you don't need to walk far. There are plenty of security staff so you feel safe. The only negative things I experienced were the lack of food options and since it's a small airport you have to be bused to your plane.,4
"The only good thing is the distance to the city.. the rest is catastrophic.

The priority boarding is pointless as you still have to wait for the buss to fill up. And most likely will catch a cold waiting.

The staff and the cafeterias, well; bad. Bad service and bad food. And if you want something warm be sure with will not be.

Time to renovate and upgrade mostly anything.",1
"Bit of a queue for passport control, but otherwise nice small airport. The T2 tram into Florence goes from right outside the airport and only costs €1.50",5
"Overall, it's a good airport but hardly the airport you would think of for a city with the reputation of Florence. It's small, it doesn't have much to offer in the way of food and shopping, and the rental car facility is about a half mile away in a parking lot meant for something other than rental cars. There are two little cafe's in the airport that serve great food and drink. The waiting lines on the gates are crazy. They let people through by times, so by the time you get through, you have little time to go through duty free or really anything at the gates.",4
"The airport at san juan de bariloche has better infrastructure than this. They need to demolish it and start new. Fly to other place, even bolonia and take the train",1
"Flight Aegean Airways 365
March 28, 2023
Departure 18:50
The guy that worked at the final securiry spot is rude and wanted to provoke fight. He is a debt for the job and he needs psychological assistance.",1
"Flew to the airport and had passed all checks and got the luggage in 10 minutes. Flew in business. Taxi to center of city is 25 EUR always (24 to be precise).
Flying out is as easy as the flying in: priority lines everywhere, vip lounge is amazingly well-maintained (much better than Munich for example). All in all, we quite enjoyed it.",5
"my bag was lost on my way to Florence and at the airport we were told that they would deliver the bags to the hotel when they arrived but they didn't.  I had to go from Siena to Florence.  3 times to find two bags on different days.  if you have lost bags, go to the airport personally to check if they have arrived.",2
"On my visit here to get home, i found it was a small airport meaning rough landings on the landing strip, however, security is very quick and easy to get through unlike most airports. Because of it's  small size it is very easy to navigate. We had a personal driver get us to our hotel and back to the airport who was very helpful in telling us where we needed to go once we were inside. Side note: these drivers will also point out the best places to visit and eat etc.
The toilets i noticed were checked regularly and seemed clean to me
Instead of walking out to the plane you are required to jump on the bus to take you to the plane instead, i found this weird because it was a 10 second drive so no point really but safety comes first. It is close to the city of florence so much easier if you hate travelling for so long",4
"Very pleasant, people very waiting orderly and wearing masks! Had a horrible headache, asked for help to the young military officers stationed at the Covid tent, walked me to the doctor's office, who immediately took care of me, writing down my medical history, taking my vitals and providing medicines that right away avoid the oncoming of a tiger migraine!! Thumbs up to our military and medical staff at the Peretola airport in Florence, Italy. A huge thank you, guys, really❤️",5
Airport is close to city center. Taking tram made it easy for us. It’s a small airport but going thru security check wasn’t bad. Has alot of stores. Place is clean and staff is friendly to assist foreigners. Our Italian was limited but able to ask questions.,4
"How to ruin a great location with a subpar airport - not enough capacity during the summer, luggage takes forever, bus to the car rental was so packed we had to pay for a taxi, lines because there are not enough lifts,  just stair access to planes. Good luck! avoid it and please anyone with any responsibility should look into these comments and demand changes. I have seen airports all over the world and this one is a JOKE",1
"The worst airport of my life. No staff, no efficiency, everything takes forever. Be prepared for no AC and to stand. Unacceptable.",1
"It was fast and organized but covid restrictions make it so there was no acessible bathroom when leaving. Transportation to the city center was very accessible and fast. Small and not particularly nice on the eyes, but does the work.",3
"Awful, overcrowded, lacking in facilities. More space for shopping than actual people.",1
"Small airport with a weird setup for the departure gates (the connection between gate 1 and the other gates is very narrow and, in summer, very hot).",3
"Not the most convenient airport. Most people had to sit on the floor while waiting hours on their (delayed) flights. The one toiletfacility present was providing little relief with its broken taps, air dryer and soap dispensers. Catering topped off the experience with a €6 simple sandwich in a cramped up restaurant place.
Florence itself is great though ;-)",1
"Tiny airport with VERY limited amenities! Don't arrive early thinking you will ""hang out"", have some drinks, have a sit down dinner... There is one small cafe with limited food options-- pizza, some pastries, coffee, and few other items-- but no real restaurants. The waiting/boarding area for flights is small, so don't expect to get a seat. Likely you'll be standing with the rest of the crowds.

But, on the plus side, I never had trouble finding a first or second row parking spot when picking people up at arrivals.. But the arrivals parking isn't cheap at 3 euro per hour. Getting to the airport is a little confusing, even with Google Maps, so allow for a little more time than you expect when arriving.",2
"Just renewed and refurbished. Clean design and faster security procedures makes this small but important airport an interesting hubnto access Italy. Polite staff helps you during the process and everyone in my today experience went smooth.
A new big duty free invite you for the last buy choosing between all the big brands.
The renewed Business License spoil you while waiting your flight.",4
"We had a terrible experience at this airport. First, it's tiny and staff is not very helpful or communicative when there are issues. Second, the flight we were waiting for was unexpectedly diverted to Bologna airport ""due to wind"" (although no other flight was diverted) but there was NO announcement and the board changed only 15 minutes before boarding. Eventually we were bussed to Bologna and put on the plane but we missed our connection in Paris and our luggage was a day behind us.",1
"Worst airport. Very crowded, long lines, a mess.  Way too small for amount of passengers.",1
"After reading reviews we even wanted to fly from Rome, but because we had little time, decided to take a risk. In the end, we had a good experience with this airport: clean, lots of shops, no lines at registration at security and a very comfortable VIP lounge with a nice choice of drinks and snacks, and many seats. Definitely better than many of the airports I've been too, incl Rome airport and Heathrow.",5
"Quite small airport , not to many shops",4
"3rd world countries have better airports with better organisation. Staff flustered. Yell at customers and each other.

Flights always cancelled. Basically it's a bus port in disguise of airport. Planes get turned into bus trips to another airport
No announcements are made. Rely on chinese whispers to get information. So much confusion.

I had to make announcements for fellow travelers as the staff said they couldn't announce because the speakers were broken.

The one positive experience I had was the security guard confiscated my bottle of wine and genuinely offered me to drink the whole thing before passing security so I wouldn't waste it.",1
"Warm, not well organised. No self check-in machine worked. Strange plan of transit area.",3
"the airport is small. they have a problem of organization in the control of passports both at landing and at departure. Although there were many at the landing, at first there was only one man then the second one came but it went very slowly. Also, at the start, do not spend too much time on the shops because the last check, the passport one, lasted an hour because the same story at the beginning was just a man then the seat came and went slowly and eventually they came those from the aircraft that had been late for a long time.",3
"When planes manage to land, expect a “bit” of a wait at arrival. In the last few times I landed here I had to wait for over 45 minutes to get my luggage... for a one-and-half hour flight. Mind you, it is still faster than being diverted to Bologna.",2
This airport is incredibly easy to get around. It's super small and convenient. The toilets are clean and the facility in general is well kept. There are plenty of taxis outside ready to take you to the center of Florence (or anywhere else for that matter) in minutes and for a very low cost.,5
"Avoid at all cost if you have checked in baggage. The Lost and found office is open only 2 hours a day and calling the phone number send you to a prerecorded message that either ask you to call between 8-9am and 15-16pm or that disconnects the call after a prerecorded message. Use Pisa, Perugia, Rome or Bologna and steer clear of this place you want to visit Tuscany and Florence.",1
Hot and totally disorganized. They do not respect boarding procedure - eg boarding by zones was discarded…,1
"Appallingly bad airport. Read all the reviews including those about delayed take-offs & thought it can't be that bad. However, it is and then some! Our flight back to City Airport, London. Was late in taking off by over three hours apparently due to strong winds on the runway; looked more like a gentle breeze & other aircraft were taking off! We even had to go back to the stand at one point for a doctor and ambulance to attend to passengers suffering in the extreme heat - no air-con on the aircraft. When we finally arrived at city Airport, most people's luggage including my wife's had been left back in Florence - the excuse given was that due to waether conditions and the short runway, they couldn't take all the bags! My wife eventually got her luggage 3 days later. I'd strongly advise against using this airport.",1
"Not enough seats at the gates and only 1 restaurant.  Our plane was delayed by more than a hour together with 2 other planes. The crew at the gates were far from efficient, not really speeding up the boarding process.",2
Disaster in such nice place like Florence. Italians don't care of tourist. They treat them as a milk cows. Quality of service at the airport is unacceptable. Rent a car service less than poor.  If you are unlucky because your flight was canceled immediately escape from this place.  Otherwise you spend few hours to be informed that they rescheduled your flight in two days.,1
"No pedestrian access. Had to pay a taxi €20 for a 2km journey (early Sunday morning rate). Bizarre, claustrophobic design.",2
"Online check in not possible, and only one check-in desk open for approximately 4 flights departing at the same time. One hour queue time for check in, even though the airport is relatively empty.  Incredibly inefficient and rude.",1
The lost luggage office is completely useless. Not only did the clerk fill out the lost luggage form incorrectly making it impossibile to trace the luggage via web. The office supposedly answers the from 8am to 9am and 15 to 16. No one answers the phone.,1
"My flight was delayed by 4 hours, so I missed my connection and then they lost my luggage, it's been 5 days that I call all the services of the airport one by one to know what's happening with my luggage, no service answers. I think that nobody works in this airport...",1
This airport is small but very conveniently connected to the city center - it's just one ride with a tram from the SMN station.,5
Very nice staff. Its little but efficient,5
"The airport is small which is nice, however if you have rented a car the shuttle takes ages and there is no process. People are trying to storm the bus like it is a refugee boat.",2
"Weird , italy is an awful place with racist people , they don't imbrace difference.  And veuling is a terrible Airline very predgudice, rude, disrespectful, no manners, condescending, patronising,  money making greedy and godless towards anyone who is not italian or spanish and dosnt agree with there godless  ways . Never again will I use that Airline. Taxi drivers in italy are thieves and abusive, they rob you when they know you are foreign, God isn't asleep and will deal with the taxi driver in question. Mark my words .🔥",1
"Pleasantly surprised with this airport! Getting to it from the city center isn’t exactly convenient, sure, but the aiport itself is clean and functional, with smooth security and a decent selection of shops.  If your ticket allows it, check out the lounge area too :)",5
"Very little place, but... If you arrive, you wait minutes to get everyone from the plane to enter the bus, and the bus takes you like 10 metres. It's crazy. On departure, the way to the gates is zig-zag so it is really long. What I hate most is having only one bathroom for all the people in the departure zone. The second star is for the great bar in the same zone, which I like.",2
"Very unorganized. Our flight was supposed to leave at 9:50 and they made no announcements about it being delayed. So people are waiting to board are you start hearing people say it’s delayed by an hour and 15 minutes or so. So chaos ensues and everyone is rushing to the info desk. Meanwhile I get a text from travelocity saying it’s delayed by 2 hours and 10 minutes (which means I would miss my connecting flight to the USA) so I finally get up to the desk (20 minutes or so have passed and they still haven’t made an announcement but they finally updated a nearby board saying the flight is delayed) and show her the text about it being delayed 2 hours 10 minutes and she dismisses the message and says I don’t know where you got that information from. Then her colleague gets on the phone next to her and after a few seconds hangs up and says yes my text is correct, it’s delayed 2 hours. They are so unorganized that I knew the knew flight information before they did! And when I told her we would be getting there at the same time that our next flight was supposed to leave she said she couldn’t help me and that I would have to figure it out when I got there. Awesome.",1
"The airport itself is very nice and modern inside with nice amenities.  The issue is the weather.  I flew in on Christmas day.  But my large suitcase filled with my clothes and Christmas presents for my host family did not.  I expected it the next day. But it was foggy and all planes that day were diverted from Florence to Bologna. My bag went back to Paris.  THIS HAPPENED 5 MORE DAYS IN A ROW!!!  If there is ANY fog, no landings or takeoffs.  I cant speak for Summer or Spring or Fall, but only Winter time.   I finally got my bag 8 days after I landed.  Then 3 days later, upon leaving Pisa/Florence it was raining and some fog, but not bad.  The flight out was diverted to Bologna.  We were then bused to Bologna one hour away. Missed my connecting flight in Paris to Detroit.  Had to spend night in Paris and make arrangements for other connecting flights to Dallas via New York.  Very frustrating trip to central Italy. I will not fly into Florence again in the wintertime way too stressful and frustrating.  Better to fly to Bologna or Pisa or Rome and catch a train especially if you have to make a connection in Paris or anywhere else.  Not worth the risk. I wasted 2-3 days of my time because of super short single runway and Fog.  There is nice farmland to the NE of airport to Double the length of a new runway. They should STRONGLY consider this.",3
"Unfortunately we have had a very poor experiemce at the airport in Florence. We arrived 3 hours early for our flight. Since it was raining, apparently we were not allowed to check our bags until 30 minutes prior to the flight leaving. Therefore, our entire flight of 150-200 people did a mad scramble through baggage check, security, and running to the gates. This caused unnecessarily long lines at all locations. When we got to our ""gate"", we got on a bus. The busses then had to wait for everyone that was on our flight before driving to the plane. The sad thing is that there were alot of very nice shops and stores in the airport, which no one had time to even look at, because they were all behind security. The employees of the stores were standing there with no one shopping, watching all of us scramble to get through security.

FYI - oir flight was to Paris - so its not like we were on a rare and wierd destination.

All in all, this is the most inefficient airport i have ever been in. If it is at all possible, fly into and out of other Italian cities, and take the train to Florence.",1
"I understand that the departure area is under renovation (but seems it has been for a while now) honestly this airport is way way too small, it looks promising after security with the dutyfree area but don’t let it fool you, the way too small sitting area at the gates was cramped with people and the only place that sells (way too expensive but that’s airport food) food stopped serving warm dishes (fastfood) at 16:00?? The shuttle service to the citycentre goes twice in an hour, which is way too little at times but it goes fast and easy, therefor I give it an extra star.",2
"If you are staying in a nearby hotel, walking into the airport is inconvenient and very dangerous as the route crosses the arterial road leading to the highway and there is no pedestrian access on the route.",1
"Our lugagge was delayed and the airport was not able and had no interest in helping us.
One person told us, our lugagge will be shipped to our hotel in the evening, another person told us, she does not know, when or how we will receive our lugagge. Simply NOBODY at the Lost & Found department is willing to work and help us. Nobody answers at the Lost & Found hotline (even in the given times), nobody at different departments at the airport could help us. Everybody said correspondingly ""I dont know how I can help you, but I hope you receive your lugagge soon"".

Advice for everybody who miss their lugagge: Drive to the airport yourself a few hours later or the next day and ask, if your lugagge is there.
Ours was there for a whole day and nobody thought about calling us, that our luggage arrived. I have never experienced such a poor service",1
"Absolutely “disconnected” to the city centre.
No metro, buses coming from city centre to airport never show up.in the end we took a bus that stopped nearby the airport , and asked some hotel staff what’s the best way to go to airport from there, and they all told us to take a taxi.(it’s actually just 2km away) . And we called a taxi, but got informed that no taxi was available (Italian speed). So we ran on the highway to approach the airport. Thank you, Florence for giving us this unforgettable experience.",1
A little chaotic fr foreigners visiting as  signs are in Italian; staff are not as welcoming and helpful as one would expect especially for non Italian speaking visitors. Tarmac only so walk off or bus transfers only. Nice duty free shops..,3
"Have a flight at 6:30am so basically need to get to the airport at 4am... However no public transportation except taxi is available to take you to the airport at this early (public transportation i.e. Trains, stop service at ~8/9pm).. I decided to come to the airport the night before and stay a night at the airport so that I don't miss my flight. HOWEVER, the airport closes at 12 midnight and doesn't only until 4am in the morning... So me and quite some people (who has the same situation as mine) got kick out of the airport and need to spend the night outside (freezing cold in May)....just be aware.",2
"Absolutely horrendous customer service. Our luggage was lost flying into this airport and we were told by the lost and found department that we would receive it back within 24-48 hours. A week later... Still no luggage and we are only able to call lost and found between the hours of 8-9am and 3-4pm. The trouble is that there is no phone holding system so if the line is busy, you won't get a hold of anyone and the system will hang up on you. We have tried contacting them by phone for several days with no success. In 2018, an international airport should have a better phone and communication system. Avoid this airport if you can help it.",1
"Slowest check in process for Lufthansa I have ever experienced. 10 available counters with only 3 staffed and a huge queue. Multiple staff sitting idle and seem unconcerned about the stress the process (or lack of process) is causing their customers.

Update:
Lufthansa flight cancelled because of “weather”. See attached for what weather looks like.",1
You cannot stay overnight at this airport and around midnight the staff will ask you to leave kindly. They recommended the gas station located right next the parking lot that works 24h where you can wait for a few hours till the airport reopens.,1
"Absolute disaster. Avoid at all cost!
Nowhere to sit, bare minimum to eat and extremely slow staff. Use literally any other airport if available.",1
"The departures area needs renovation!

The arrivals looks better. Not so many shops after security check. The only place there that has quality products is super expensive for the products offering from Tuscan area.

Try more ... You have a city that is gem and an airport that sucks!",2
Small but packed international airport. Feels like no air conditioning at all! Never come back to Florence again.,1
Smaller airport but well staffed and efficient. Tram right outside with a ticket machine.,5
Get here early. They're completely disorganized. The line for checkin is backed up to the elevators. Outrageous in the time of covid that they would force us all to stand so close for so long.  Absolute gross negligence by the staff here.,1
"Slow air port with staff who does not really care for your air plane making it today or tomorrow. Nice renovation inside ongoing, though. Extremely poor rental car service level (not operated by air port facility)",2
"The passport control speed is a joke, even for europeans. No automated gates, only two bored officers. Based on other reviews it seems is not an accident. They do not realise that next time, tourists will prefer other destinations.",1
"Very limited sitting next to the gate, wifi works at the departure hall but not at the gates. Power outlets do not work. Otherwise typical regional airport, direction signs are clear, connection to the city centre is decent.",3
"10 Gates with seating for about 200 people makes finding a seat almost impossible. Elderly and mothers with children roaming around looking for rest.
An unattractive and worn down building rude staff and always the risk of having the flight moved to another airport due to wind.

Nice coffee at arrival, though.",2
"Terrible airport. Flight keeps getting delayed, now 10 hours because they don't have a crew for the flight. Airport closes at midnight. Fly somewhere else.",1
"Toilets STUNK, no soap, very dirty. Downstairs wine shop staff super RUDE. For the amount of the money this airport is making through tourists, they should fix this place up. I will never fly back to this airport!",1
"This entire airport was very warm and smelled like a bathroom. However, no issues with transit or facilities otherwise.",2
"Worst European airport !!!
Dirty, lines with no information, nobody at the check with automatic check in not available, température is very low we were freezing inside, poor number of shops …
The security check is a bunch of incompetents who confiscate solid instead of liquid !!!! Because you know it s liquid cause you can put it on a toast !!! Yeah of course like water on a toast … with a pound and not volume on it … so I think clearly this lady should have skip some physic classes !
And after that she permits to use familiarities in Italian ! I m going to contact the airport this is clearly unacceptable from employees.",1
"The lost and found office has been an absolute nightmare to deal with. Their working hours are a joke, and the lack of communication over our lost baggage has been so stressful. I will never fly through Florence again if I can help it.",1
"Baggage lost during flight. Search was started. We were told it would be delivered within 24 hours. But now it is not possible to gain any information on the whereabouts of our luggage. The phonenumber is a bad joke, with a computervoice that states, that the search is ongoing. Emails are not being answered. The airline is waiting 5 days for the airport to do something. Unfortunately it seems, that nobody is interested in helping us. And 5 days is a very long time on a holiday without most of our luggage.
It would really help to talk to a human being from the lost & found Departement.. but that is impossible. Thanks for a ruined holiday.",1
I just went through security and was told to take my MEDICAL ID bracelet off! I was crying after due to the treatment I received here.,1
"This is the worst airport I've ever used in my life. If you are visiting Florence, please avoid using this airport. Pisa or Bologna is a a lot better alternative to access to Florence city.
Facilities are old as many already pointed out, but the worst point is that flights here are often cancelled or delayed.
When I checked in, I was told I may not be able to get on board due to the weight limitation caused by the wind in Florence area. The lady at the counter rudely said my tickets had no priority to put me on the orginal flight as they had more important customers than me. She also said nothing is sure until 1hr before the flight, maybe I would be allowed to fly from Florence as planned, so I waited for the announcement until then and even a lot after that time. After my original flight has already departed with ""more important customers"", poor passangers like us were told to go to Bologna airport and then take a flight. The worse part is that the flight they offred us was the one we had to change once to get to the destination.
In the end, I arrived in the destination 8hrs later than expected. During the process, the staff at Florence airport said no one word of apologies. I really felt insulted by them, I will NEVER use this airport again.",1
"Also known as ""Pretola""

It's a very very small airport only European flights until now are departing as they only have few landing lanes

The airport is super small guess no more than 10 gates shops only two tiny coffees after check in and one before check in.",2
Do your best not to fly out of here.... several flights cancelled with no explanations. The ladies at the check in were nice and did their best. But if the wind blows in the wrong direction planes wont fly. Sorry excuse for an airport. Avoid flying Iberia... terrible.,1
"Badly organised, overloaded and understaffed, resulting in a 90 minute delay to our flight back to Gatwick. Best avoided if you can.",1
"VERY bad organised, people working there sooo rude, not willing to help you at all! Especially people at the metal detectors, security workers so rude! I travel every month all around Europe and I've never  felt so bad!",1
Nothing fancy. The entrance is annoying as one has to walk through a maze of shops that's larger than the terminal hall before getting to the terminal hall. This can be very stressful.,3
"Very small airport, lots of people use this airport for Florence trip. The airport is connected through tram services. After exiting one have to turn left and have to walk. Only automatic ticket machine is there to book a ticket, after buying ticket one have to validate the ticket into the ticket machines, which are located inside the tram coach.",3
Bad. Not really turists friendly. Cold food and no restaurant available near the gates,1
"Horrible terrible waiting to check in process.  Fly out from ANOTHER airport if possible.  Even if you come to check in early, they will only allow you to check in flights 2 hours in advance.",1
The customs workers were extremely rude and very inapropiate. There was no queue but the woman was really impatient and arrogant,1
"After reading many bad reviews of this airport as our vacation in Florence was coming to an end, I did not have high expectations.  However, it was quite the opposite for us.  We flew out of the Florence airport this past August, 2017 and had no issues.  We did have a 10:00am flight and the weather was warm and clear.  Our flight to Paris left on time and we made our connections the rest of the day.  Therefore, I guess we were lucky that day.  So, I would say it all depends on the weather.  Florence is a wonderful place and with a little luck, your flight should be on schedule.  We would do it again!",5
Terrible checking in service. Most travelers arrived 2 hours prior to their flight and stood in line to check in for so long that their flight got delayed by 40 minutes.,2
New tram service has started to take you directly into Florence city centre. Tram no 2. Buy your ticket before you board or you will face a €50 fine. Tickets cost €1.50 each & are valid for 90 minutes. Validate your ticket when you board at the yellow machines. Trams run every 10 minutes. Journey time is 20 minutes.,4
"A friend was racially profiled and singled out in a flight from Florence to Madrid. This is unacceptable and an airport I will now avoid, there was no reason for her and another passenger who were the only POC to be stopped with no reason and be questioned and embarrassed when they were not exhibiting any behavior that would demand suspicion",1
"Check in 5min, security 10 min, wonderful small airport with nice cafes before check in and partner VIP lounge near the gates. Not sure what all the bad reviews are about but I'm glad I didn't have to experience it.",5
"Very tiny and overcrowded airport, try to avoid it whenever possible. The staff is incompetent and unfriendly, too. Additionally the transfer (only possible by bus) to the car rental station is a disaster, it takes almost 20mins for approx. 500m and the shuttle buses are overcrowded and don't run frequently.",2
"Extremely small and understaffed for the crowds that pass through it, resulting in chaotic lines and no place to sit. The only positive is the convenient location.",2
"A friend's luggage went missing and after initially being told we would not know when the luggage would be delivered, we were provided with a contact number. The contact number is not answered.  The office is only open for 2 hours a day and during thr opening hours the office was unattended for the first half hour. An email was sent to my friend saying he could collect his luggage from the airport (on the last day of his stay in Tuscany) however, once we arrived we were told the luggage was not there and was with a courrier. So my friend has left now with no idea if or when his luggage may be returned to him in Australia.  The service was really poor and the whole situation was unbelievable. This is not an uncommon experience either, we were in line with about 7 other people all in the exact same situation. We were advised by a local to avoid the airport and instead to fly in to Rome and train from there.",1
Most worst airport i ever seen.. Absolutely Desaster.. Not professional in any direction,1
"Probably one of the worst airport you could wish for.
Extremely incompetent staff.
Be prepared to pay an overcharge of €8 for your extra back as they will not be able to take payment on the check in desk or apply your allowance.
Just a real shamble",1
"For one of the world's most beautiful cities, it is a truly stunning effort to create such an awful airport. No food options (literally one fast food place after security), terribly laid out and not fit for purpose.",1
"Funny.  Expected more from Florencd. Terminal is pleasant enough.  Not what I expected for an airport serving a city hosting GE Oil & Gas and all the tourists.

The lounge is before you pass through security (LOL).  The waiting area is pretty bleak.

Security was smooth at 4:30 in the morning... arrived 2 hours before the flight (as suggested by my hotel receptionist ... silly rabbit)

Free WiFi",3
The runway is apparently too small and flights are frequently cancelled or passengers are denied boarding to meet the weight restrictions. This may happen only in the fall but it was the case 2 days in a row. Communication from the ground staff is terrible and everyone seems to be fed up with the situation including the staff. Extremely unpleasant. If possible avoid Florence airport.,1
Small but perfectly formed and efficient airport. The sad thing personally was having to stand in the non-EU/Other passports queue for the first time.,4
Horrible customer service. Hundreds of passengers waiting to check in. Must take a bus to and from your airplane. Spend a little money and build a real airport!,1
Flights are always delayed and help is scarce when you get stranded here due to cancelled flights. Vending machines will take your money but don't give you the food,1
"Pretty small airport but easy to reached from Firenze.
Toilets were cleaned.
Easy to find your way once inside.
There is also a little shop if you forgot something!",4
If I could do a no star I would !!!!!This is the worst place I have ever been. My luggage got left in New York ( in the states) and they send it to Florence airport. I told them I was going to come get it since I was in Florence for three days and thought I would be able to come get. But I was leaving Florence and need them to go ahead and just send it back home. It’s been two weeks and I have been trying to get ahold of them to give them my address. But they Never answer and just drop my call. I have never had this type of problem. So if you loose your luggage forget about calling they never answer,1
"I was travelling to Venice and Florence and at the airport I think I had the worst coffee yet ( even in the train from Venice to Florence the coffee was better...) Poor breakfast choice at the coffe place after check-in as well..

For the people that have to present ID or Pass before boarding, there is separate waiting space with NO Toilett!!!, no drinks nor snacks...

I suggest you fly to another airport like Rome for ex. and take a train to Florence.

At the boarding there was only one lady, some passengers had problem with the tickets and all the other passengers behind them had to wait... At boarding normally there should be at least 2 persons checking boarding pass and so on...not here..Eventually one lady came but even then we still had to wait...",1
"Additional check for coronavirus at the airport arrival. Unclear reason, no real inspection in fact. Just to put a mark on luggages....?  No business lounge available... just a few people by security check, long queue....",1
"Small airport so you can get through fast. One lounge shared by all airlines, was okay but a little small.",5
Very small airport with a huge wind problem. I got my flight cancelled at least 30% of the times flying from here regularly. Pisa and Bologna are close and strongly suggested as an alternative,2
"Wish we can put 0…
Nothing to eat, super super dirty, no place to sit.
We will really make sure not to travel from Florence next time",1
"My moms luggage got lost by the the airline and it was impossible to get ahold of them during phone hours and automated messages were out of date and inaccurate. Having lost luggage many times before, this is clearly the worst service ever. Making it worse it was her 75th bday.",1
"Barely any toilets, crappy wifi and the hole place looks dirty and old. Desperately needs renovation. Doesn't have enough seats so people sit on the ground while waiting for their plane.",2
I am a frequent flyer and do not recommend to land in Florence. The traffic in the airport is very sensible to weather conditions: with a bit of wind flights are redirected either in Pisa or Bologna. This happens quite often believe me.,1
"I hate when police ask me for my ID while am about to check in,  if am checking in i must have documents... if u r looking for terrorist go to the entrance morons!
Why this bigots italian picked on me out of 300 and precisely when checking in? If the imbeciles want to prevent attentats they should do the randoom screening at the airport entrance, when you are already at the checkin counter is already too late! Dont you think?

I wanna file a racial profiling complain but i do not know where...
Happened yesterday around 10.30am at alitalia counter

PS
Alitalia counter is super... slow",2
Very nice airport. It is small in size but very modern. It has a lounge on the air side with snacks and drinks.,5
"OK-ish regional airport relatively small for the volume of tourists visiting Florence and Tuscany. However more importantly the airport is a nightmare for travellers. Both our arrival AND departure were diverted because of  excessive wind.

This airport is a hit and miss when it comes to planes landing because of its bad location - dangerously close to some tall hills. And it happens to flights all the time.

Book your flight to/from Pisa or Bologna. The chances are your plane will get diverted there anyway. You get more choice of flights at theses alternative airports, probably cheaper and  you avoid the frustration of severe delays.",1
"Worst airport I’ve ever been. Too crowded/collapsed, almost no food services or spaces to wait for flight. Try Pisa instead.",1
"Smells like a public bathroom during a cleaning strike, EVERYWHERE. Besides, they close down a whole area I believe to save money while there are no seats available for people waiting for gate opening, embarrassing. shame!!!! The worst experience ever.",1
"I have been in a looot countrys and this is the worse airport in the world, a lot of money in this city but with a horrible airport",1
"Too many people, a lack of benches, and a lack of cafes. A bigger airport is needed.",3
Baccanale restaurant service was poor. Had to wait while server finished has conversation with other waiter. He then made coffee using preheated cooled milk and then was upset when asked to make a properly. Also first gave me change for a 20 Euro note although gave him a fifty. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for this as a mistake. I suggest you go elsewhere.,1
"I was having a lunch at a snack bar called ""Wine and Food"", and one of the stuff almost hit me when I told him to relax, because he tried to clean my plate in a really brutal way that all the plates and cutlaries jumped out of the tray. It was my first time threated by a waiter like this for no reason. I will never use this airport again.",1
"Terrible check in experience. Lack of staff, those who are there are totally overwhelmed. It’s a real mess… allow lots of time or travel via somewhere else if you can…",1
"Small, no seats and not much.",1
No place to sit. For the cost of the flight it should give better conditions while the passangers are waiting,1
You can't leave people in ridiculous temperatures stood waiting on a bus for 45 minutes.,1
"Terribly run, very slow. Flew TAP out of here and they had 1 person working the desk for maybe a couple hundred people waiting on line so it took forever. If my flight hadn’t gotten pushed back I probably would have missed it.",1
No jet bridges. It’s all taking buses to planes. The “terminals” where you wait for bus are so tightly packed together that it results in one of the worst airport experiences imaginable. They need to convert 50% of their duty free shops into terminal space.,1
"My flight was supposed to take off at 11:10 to Rome, and I was still sitting on the plane in the runway at 11:50. There was no announcements about delayed flight and I had a connecting flighting in Rome. Airport is so unorganized.",1
It’s a perfect airport,5
Absolutely no help with lost bag!  Will look for other ways to get to Florence.  Need someone in the baggage claim with compassion.  Shocking how a wonderful city can have such awful customer service in baggage claim.,1
"Avoid flying out of here at all costs, they will kick passengers off the plane at no notice due to the dangerously short run way and baggage/passenger weight limits",1
"Do NOT rent cars in this airport, 2 hr waite to get my car from Hertz",1
It's small and easy to navigate. Personal are polite and helpful. Quite a few options for food for such a small airport.,5
"One of the worst airports ever designed. When it rains, flights are canceled. When little wind, same. I still have no idea how it is possible that this airport is still opened.",1
Decent airport with very limited taxi’s. Plan accordingly.,1
"Awful airport. Staffs here don't want to speak english. There's no line, no politness and no arrangement. Even with the sun shinning brightly, almost all flights are either delayed or canceled. LOL.",1
So so so hot in here. Hot and crowded. Not enough seating even for a Tuesday afternoon. Only plus is that it was easy to reach with public transport.,2
Took the T2 tram from Firenza train station and checked in with Lufthansa. The experience has been fine. Our flight is mid afternoon on a Tuesday.,4
"DOV:Nov2016  Though I read lots of bad review about the airports and flight delays, I do not face any problem. However there was big queue in the check-in counter.",3
"Flew in on TAP from Lisbon. No jetway, but no bus either - just walked right into baggage claim! Very convenient without all the walking!",5
"Small, but comfortable. Decent shopping for a small place if you feel the need. Clean restrooms.",4
Never fly in or out of Florence directly. They are so inefficient and disorganized. They give you little to no information and you are let waiting for hours.,1
"Dante's Hell, recreated in airport form.  Possibly the worst check-in experience anywhere, ever.  Hour-long queues.  People skipping lines and being served ahead of others.  No organisation or control.  Staff sitting at desks but waving passengers away. A scrum around each check-in desk.  Passengers shouting.   Staff shouting.  Cancelled flights.  Buses to other airports.  For a tourist showpiece like Florence to have such an abysmal airport is unbelievable.  Avoid at all costs.",1
It is a small airport. Serves its purpose.,3
"Worst airport I've been in a while, is a mess everywhere,smells, only 1 place to eat after passing gate, delays all day, just a clusterfuc$",1
"As always a pleasure to arrive and to depart from. Compact, quick handling, great service, friendly staff.",5
It’s amazing you can go on an international flight to Houston Texas de board a plane with 400+ people go through customs have your bags and be outside within 20 minutes and in Florence it’s a gamble you never know it can be no less than 35 minutes but on average 40 - hour to get out of the plane obtain your bags and get to the curb worst managed little airport I’ve ever seen in my life!!!,1
The only reason why I'm giving this review 2 stars is because we checked in and flew through security in 20 minutes! The unfortunate part about this is the food and shopping on the other side. Where's the Italian love for the food?!,2
"it is literally one of the worst airports in the world.. the staff is not helpful at all, at the passport control it literally took 10 min per person, because of that we left more than one hour later..just two offices at the passport control for a flow of thousands of people...degrading",1
Car rental shuttle runs once an hour so you have to pay for a taxi to and from the airport which is around the corner,1
Very cute airport. 😺,4
"The worst airport ever. I can not believe that the local government pockets all the tax money instead of investing some in that dump. Wc so stinky and dirty you can not enter, not enough seats, staff supper rude.",1
"Nice small airport, they were very helpful when we found that our baggage had been in Amsterdam.",4
Total missmamanagment at check-in. Almost missed my flight after 1h waiting.The staff simply went home and the people in lines were staring at the empty counters.,1
The passport control is a joke. It takes forever and there is absolutely no automation. Please upgrade the airport to standard automatic passport control systems,1
"This airport is the absolute worst place to fly out of. You will either get delayed, cancelled, or your luggage will get lost. Three of these occurences in just a month.",1
Great airport. Very clean and well-kept. Nicely designed and very quick to get through security and check in,5
"Very nice, small and clean.",4
Nightmare with lost luggage. Lost and Found doesn't work at all and are only available from 8am to 9am and 3pm to 4pm. Staff is clueless and don't bother to help. If you plan to come to Florence get a flight into another city and come by bus or car.,1
Apart from not being able to use the EU passport lane all work well and quickly.,4
"The terminal closes from 00:30 until 04:00! My flight is at 06:30 and I got here early to check bags and SURPRISE, SURPRISE: it was closed! In this damn cold weather. Me, my mother and my aunt (both 60+ y.o.!) OUTSIDE, IN THE COLD!",1
Eh. Not my best airport.,2
"Lost my luggage and found it 8 days later as we were leaving, was there the whole time. Impossible to communicate with them.",2
"Doesn't deserve even one star as customer service are very far away from knowing what is a customer.
If you are going to use this airport, please be aware of bad experiences through you visit here.",1
"Whilst the checking in process was fine, the food in the airport is truly awful and lets down the region, which otherwise has great food and service. At the very least eat before you depart or arrive.",2
Very small but efficient and painless 👌🏽✈️ there is an additional food and beer place at the gates too.,5
Probably the worst airport ive been to in the past 10 years. Not enough cafes for travelers and not enough seats. The only place i could get food at was very dirty and horrible food. Very disappointed and I am a regular traveler.,1
"Small, badly laid out and woefully inadequate to service the tourists arriving en masse to Florence. Such a massively underwhelming way to arrive to (or depart from) this great city.",2
"Passport control on incoming flights is ridiculous. Waiting for nearly an hour to clear the passengers from one flight is unacceptable. With more flights coming from London this is only going to get worse.

Sort it out!",1
"small airport and no organisation at all,two different flights mixed together in one line to check in.
after checking in,we have to take our luggages,and come back to drop off it one hour later,never met this situation before!and at last they canceled our flight,terrible experience.",1
"Why does Florence airport insist on bussing passengers from gate to plane at a distance of less than 30 metres. It’s annoying, unnecessary and surely not good for the carbon footprint?",1
Great airport. Stop by global blue across from the check in count re for your tax refund before checking your bag for those leaving the EU.,5
Worst airport ever. Super inefficiënt. People that work here don't seem to make any effort being faster than a turtle.,1
This has to be the worst organised airport I've ever been at and the people couldn't care less.,1
"Terrible airport, insufficient chairs so you are likely to sit on the floor, only one (overpriced) cafeteria at the airport where food is not tasty. Unkind staff and just terrible altogether",1
The airport is closed 12:30-4am.,3
Tiny airport. Limited direct flights. 15 mins from city center. No issues getting luggage. Planes unload on tarmac and you shuttle to terminal,4
Encountered racism by airport staff.,1
"HORRIBLE SERVICE! The airport closes from 0:00-4:00 AM.. can you believe it? Also the seats are so stupidly small, it makes you think that all the years of architecture history were lost",1
"This airport is a joke, security opens late, passport checks opens late and all the passengers already arrived but there’s no one working there",1
"No notification, it is completely crowded, all flights at the same time so there is 1100000 people in gates and no place to sit. Horrible",1
"No shops, limited food options and dirty toilets",1
"Very slow. Not an enjoyable experience. Very hot and crowded, also a lack of seating space.",1
Efficient and clean only downside was the snack prices they let you pay 30 euros for a burger if you are daft enough,4
The ticket machine at the tram station doesn't accept card easily (if at all). Carry some cash!!,4
"Sink broken, water block...the hook of clothes is also broken after hanging a simple clothe...hotel looks pretty but the quality of facilities are really low aim...not worth to call 4 stars hotel",3
They should close. For 10 minutes rain they been able to delay all flights of one and half hour. No buses to transfer passengers....,1
"Lovely airport. Small, clean, efficient and friendly. We loved Florence. We will return!!",5
"Unacceptable that you can do an online check in at this airport in 2022 and have to wait 1,5 hours in the line!!!",1
Rude staff. Didn't take into consideration my medical condition. Very upset about the way I was treated. Looking for an email address so I can contact someone.,1
"Small airport, not a lot of services. Transportation to Florence proper can be expensive or time-consuming (at least until the light rail line is done).",3
"First time, verry crowded but nice",4
"If you lose your luggage, you can forget that you will find some contact to talk to them. Completely unprofessional",1
Like a jigsaw puzzle. Way to small to accommodate all the people.,3
Worst airport ever… probably the management of this airport should do something else. It’s frustrating to see how Italy and Florence can give such bad impression to the tourist from EU and more.,1
Amazing airport. They also have airplanes!,5
Very very very long waiting queues. 2 coffee for € 8 ish... and no friendly faces at all at the airport...,2
"The only lounge is on the landside, not airside, of the airport. For connecting flights you need to go through baggage check.",2
The most incompetent airport I have ever traveled through. Lost 30 bags on one flight. One person working lost and found.,1
Worst airport I have ever been to. For a delayed flight there were no system-wide announcements and no queuing system which resulted in total chaos.,1
"Almost no oower sockets to charge your devices, seating area is cramped, but there seems to be enough space for crappy fashion shops.",1
Getting the tram to get to city center is super easy and it only costs €1.50 do not waste your money on a taxi.,5
Last plane in and bags came out in minutes…no complaints,4
Small airport with super smooth transport to the heart of Florence with the tram just outside. 1.50 eur.,5
"Supersmall, it gets crowded and hot just with a couple of flights. People sitting on the floor and stairs, narrow corridor to get to all the gates",1
"Very small  very easy to find…
But Customs incredibile 😨",3

Careful : no smoking lounge once security is passed.,2
Planes are delayed and cancelled often.  Several days in a row sometimes.  Rental car locations are sub par.,1
Nice setup and clean. Could do with more seating area at food area and at gate area.,4
"Looong lines, 'nobody' working. 2 out of 10 desks open. Stayed in line for 2h 30m",1
"My flight got changed and I called, wasn‘t able to reach a human. My call got canceled.",1
"The airport is larger than its look, don't be fooled by the small corridors (be there early)",4
There are never enough seats at the gates.... Sad conditions before onboarding....,3
Very efficient arrival. Covid 19 Test 20 Euros and results in 30.minutes!!,5
Small and fast airport,5
Ridiculous passport control at arrival. It took nearly 1h 45mins to go through passport control! Not acceptable!!!!,1
"Lounge is before you pass security, no fast lane either, selection at lounge very limited, just one WC per gender, cramped and dark",2
The staff in general is not very friendly. The food is really bad. They should definitely upgrade the restaurants. Desapointing,1
"Terrible airport with no facilities, no space to sit and absolutely atrociously rude staff. Stay away",1
"Small airport, good signage, efficient check-in.",5
"It's fine.  Moves as quick and sometimes quicker.  As for bteakfastchoices,  it's an airport, people!",4
"Small, fast & friendly

And good coffee",5

Airport staff is very helpful!,5
Hastle free airport. Not overly big but good enough for a regional airport.,4
If you actually want to get where you going take a train to bologna. Trust me.,1
Lady at the border control is dumb. Advised to join the long queue when I didn’t have to. 0/10 wont travel here again.,1

"I arrived at 10pm for my 4am flight because it didn't make sense to buy a hotel room nearby for just a few hours. The C-Gate (which I've read had 24/7 security) had closed security at 10pm on 4/8/24. I confirmed that by asking multiple airport employees and several other groups of people were met with the same response from the remaining personnel. Several of us just wanted to visit a Minute Suite for the few hours left before our early morning flight. This airport is unlike many I've visited... It's supposedly a high ranking airport, but has bare bone amenities with third world conditions. Also, there are no sidewalks to safely walk the 5 minutes it takes to get to the hotel. It truly feels like an entrapment situation among big business to milk their visitors of more money.",1
"Terminal E Gates 22-whatever is the worst terminal at DFW. The security check points do not all take TSA. You have lengthy distances for ticketing. I travel through DFW often and this gate always ruins my day. It’s not customer friendly!!!  Do better DFW, close it down if you can’t make it like the rest of your gates. When you are given E gate you feel like a red headed step child this gate is so AWFUL!!!",1
"Where to begin? Rental Car shuttles run every 15 minutes if you are lucky, so lines back up for hundreds of people. Run more buses! Only one Clear + TSA Pre check across this ginormous airport. Hosre a few 22-year-old industrial engineers and they will reduce traveling pain for the tens ofillions of Homo sapiens who have the misfortune to transit through DFW!",1
"I have NEVER been treated so badly at an airport. We had a minor flying for the second time in her life we were responsible for, and when going through security at D18 at 9:40pm 3/28/24, we were met with the most RUDE AND IMPATIENT employee. We explained the situation and that her mother had secured assisted boarding, etc, to which eye rolls and outright NO COMING THROUGH SECURITY WITH HER. We didn’t know what to do and he basically told us to send her through and move aside. He didn’t even let us watch her go through security safely from the sidelines, and actually sent someone else to tell us to MOVE ALONG.  I’ve NEVER been treated so badly, I’m worried for this little girl’s flight, and after explaining to her mother what happened, I feel I wasn’t able to do my job keeping her child safe because of this guy at the security checkpoint. I hope this review gets him fired!
To top it off, we needed help and the info both was and remained deserted the entire hour and a half we were there.",1
"I understand that they have no control over bad weather and those conditions, but the airport on yesterday trying to travel back home was so chaotic and miserable. Our flight was delayed for several hours and the Terminal and Gate that the flight were to leave out of changed at least 8 times and I'm not over exaggerating. It changed right up until the last 25-30 minutes to boarding. They need to do so much better with that. You had people running all over the place due to them changing it. Thank goodness I had enough sense to sit in a restaurant until it was closer to boarding time. People are already tired from being in the airport literally all day and night. This only amplifies it.",1
"Dallas Airport is notorious for allowing other planes to idle in previously assigned gates. They are allowing other airlines to use gates without foresight for even 30 minutes into the future.

This means that if you have a connecting flight you will likely miss it. You’ll be forced to sit on the taxi way waiting for another airline to get out of your gate.

Dallas Airport operations really needs to look at other airports to understand a viable model.",1
"Hi, in the photos I attached ou can see the absurdly large line and there is only one officer attending all these people. It is crazy, we’ve heard now from people who are in the line with us that they had connections but they’ve been waiting for so long  that they missed it. I have already asked to the lady that is charge of the line, an airport worker, and she barely speaks English and said she could do nothing about it.",1
"DFW police have no brain..

Blocking traffic in Terminal B and closing the Uber lot for what? If it wasn’t shut down traffic would move as normal. Made it impossible for EVERYONE to get to Terminal A and B. DFW police just standing there like airheads doing nothing, not even directing traffic. Literal clowns.",1
"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! They Skylink was down, but there were no signs or information about it, you just had to figure it out on your own thanks to other passengers. Then when you try to figure out how to go from A terminal to a different terminal, good luck! One employee will tell you to go left, one will say go right and a third will tell you to exit the airport completely. Turns out if you are going to E terminal you do need to exit and catch a terminal link bus… spoiler alert, they hold a max of 14 passengers and take about 25 minutes to get to the next terminal where you have to go through security again. When I called the airport directory to ask if they could please handle the wild situation and help the other thousands of passengers, they said “no, we will not be doing anything about it, it was an emergency so there wasn’t anything we could do”. So no, there are no contingency plans for the only decent transportation to different terminals. Awful awful awful experience. I had a two hour layover and just barely made my flight. I feel awful for all those who didn’t make theirs because of this absolute deplorable situation.",1
"DFW used to be super easy to travel internationally from. Having always followed the instructions and used apps like MPC was super easy to get in and out of immigration. Over the last six months, DFW has removed the ability to use the MPC app. Causing much longer wait times to clear the immigration line.
What used to be super quick and simple has become very difficult and time-consuming. Would love to see DFW re-integrate into using the MPC system.",1
"Very poor experience from the American Airline as well as the baggage handlers. I came in town for a one day meeting and they lost my bag. The young lady at the baggage desk was nice and tried calling the “crew chief” but no response. Waited an hour just to hear that my bag was placed back on the plane and going to another destination. It was almost midnight at this point.

Bad communication between staff. Poorly handled situation.",1
"I am compelled to share my recent experience here which was far from satisfactory. From the moment I arrived, the service provided by the gate agents and customer service staff was subpar. The gate agents were notably unresponsive; several passengers, including myself, struggled to get clear answers regarding gate changes and flight delays. Simple inquiries seemed like monumental tasks for the agents who displayed little interest in assisting us.

Additionally, the overall demeanor of the customer service staff left much to be desired. Their approach was not just unhelpful but also grumpy, making an already stressful situation more unpleasant. There seemed to be a lack of training or perhaps a lack of motivation to provide the level of service one would expect at an international hub.

I hope this feedback reaches the management and that significant improvements are made. Travelers expect and deserve courteous and effective service, especially when dealing with the inherent stresses of air travel.",1
"Poorly managed from air traffic standpoint. 3 time in row that flights are delayed /  gates changed and delays are for hours and not just minutes for no apparent reason . It drizzles a little bit or there is flurry - get ready to spend a whole day or night  at airport. Airports shop do a roaring business because of the stranded passengers …. I guess, some is happy at least . 😀",1
"This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience I've ever had at an airport. Delays after delays. Then I had my flight canceled.  Had to miss a night I paid for my air bnb. They didn't bother to compensate for absolutely ruining my plans for the day. They didn't offer to get us a room for the night we had to stay here unplanned. They basically said I'm out of luck. Last time I'll be coming through this absolute train wreck of a place. If you don't want your day to be ruined, avoid coming here. Very very unprofessional staff here.",1
"My husband and I fly first class. We're also both visually impaired. He uses a cane and I use a guide dog. We waited over 30 minutes for a person to get us to our next gate. We ask for assistance when we registered, we double-checked it in Tucson before we left and we asked the first person waiting outside the plane if he was here for green he said yes but go up there I'll meet you. We never saw him again. We spoke with the gate agent who really could seem to care less she said I'll call but it takes him awhile to get here. When I asked what happens if we miss our plane she said then we'll take you somewhere and get you rescheduled. Four people later, all of whom refused to speak directly to us They spoke to each other or spoke on the phone and ignored our questions until my husband stepped up and demanded to be heard. This has almost always been the case in Dallas. No other airport has ever treated us so badly. We will rout through Chicago whenever possible in the future.",1
"This Airport has very bad customer service skills. I was waiting on my flight at Terminal A 17 area. I had to use the restroom and the attendant blocked it the opening and wouldn’t let me in.

This is very sad for business.",1
American Airlines and DFW staff: This was my first time flying in almost 15 years. The flight was canceled multiple times due to weather however that is understandable. When we and my fiance finally were able to fly to Dallas we were stuck on the airplane for an hour and a half since there was no available gate open for the pilot. Our bags were in two locations at DFW. We spent three hours waiting to try to locate our bags and were given the runaround with no help from the staff. After locating our bags we had to spend more money on our parking pass coming out of pocket for additional cost and time. Very disappointed in the service and staff. Absolutely no help from the staff and hard-to-understand signs for transportation to terminals are so far walk from where the state is.,1
"No Dr. Pepper anywhere on there premises. No smoking anywhere on their premises which is very prejudicial against many of their customers who are smokers. Outrageous prices from their vendors and machines. A constant hassle of being switched from one plane to another because of delays or cancellations. I have nothing good to say about this monstrosity of a place. If you are going there. Be prepared for a hassle, layovers and delays. They can't get a flight anywhere on time.",1
We paid 12 dollars just to drive to cell phone lot to wait for our sibling to land! That is ridiculous and ghetto! I have never had to pay to wait at the airport and honestly will limit my travel to this airport … I will fly to love next time,1
"Security told my poor old mother to ""shut up"" because ""I don't care"" after she gleefully tried explaining to them her issue in line. Security is loud, obnoxious, and extremely rude. I'm baggage claim yelled at me because they couldn't find my bags?",1
"On April 5, 2024, at 12 noon CST, while at Dallas Fort Worth Airport, specifically near gate E17, I encountered a situation with TSA Agent Ms. Pritchard that prompts me to share my experience. My frequent travels have taught me the immense value of the work TSA agents do, balancing rigorous security measures with the need for efficiency. Their role is undeniably critical and demanding, fostering my usual approach of patience and understanding during security checks.

However, my interaction on this day was a departure from what I've come to expect and left me feeling quite disheartened. As I prepared to pass through the TSA Pre line, I asked Agent Pritchard if I needed to remove a hoodie tied around my waist, seeking to comply fully with security protocols. The response I received was unexpectedly rude, not just in the content but significantly in the delivery. Her tone was sharply dismissive, accompanied by an eye-roll that seemed to underscore her annoyance at my question.

This encounter went beyond a simple miscommunication; it was a moment that made me feel demeaned and unnecessarily chastised. Such experiences can significantly affect one's perception of travel, overshadowing it with negativity where empathy or at least neutrality could have prevailed. My intention in writing this review is not out of spite but from a desire to highlight an area for potential improvement. Effective communication and respect form the backbone of service, especially in roles that engage with diverse groups of people daily.

By offering this feedback, my hope is to invoke a broader consideration of how patience, understanding, and professionalism are integral to TSA interactions. Cultivating a respectful and positive environment at checkpoints not only enhances the traveler's experience but also aligns with the TSA's commitment to treating every passenger with dignity and respect.",1
"My AA flight at DFW was delayed 6 times throughout  the entire day, and then 2 minutes before we were finally going to board, the attendants left the desk, and  then the board flashed CANCELLED!!
NO EXPLANATION!
Nearly every flight in every terminal experienced the same. Because of a 4 hour medium rain storm?
WHAT A CROCK!
They could have let everyone know very early on, but the
airlines/airports have their covert reasons NOT TO. By the time we were canceled, nearly every hotel in Dallas was booked. We finally left the airport at 1am, having found a room for the NEXT DAY! Slept on the marriot's couch for hours, then paid $50 more to get into a room, at 8:00am, instead of waiting for hours more!!
Got home 2 days later.",1
"The skylink is listed online as 24hrs. I walked through over 50 gates and each skylink access point said ""Out of service, proceed to next terminal."" So I did, several times. Apparently they have an hourly schedule that is not posted online nor on any of the ""out of service"" signs. Ended up having to leave and go through TSA again. Don't ever layover here late night, nothing is operable and they will not tell you what is and what isn't. You'll have to find out the hard way after walking a mile.",1
Uber drivers are paying lot of toll with every trip and we  always stuck when we got ride. We always late for pick up and it's affecting are business.they need to work on it,1
The worst airport in America. Tarmac delay on arrival over 2 hours. Finally got off at 1am and wow hope you didn’t check a bag because they will send you back and forth to different baggage claims to fill your hour and half wait. American Airlines seems to always have issues nowadays.,1
They make you re check your bag on domestic connecting flights. Caused us to miss our flight despite having a 2.5 hour layover. Almost all of that time was waiting for 1 bag. Longest lines to go back through security. AWFUL PLACE,1
"Worst airport I’ve ever stepped foot in. I’ll never step foot in this airport again. We came here for a connecting flight and we had an elderly women traveling with us in a wheelchair. The women pushing her wheelchair didn’t wait for us and literally ran her to the terminal. We were all supposed to be following the women to the terminal because we only had about 20 minutes and we’ve never been here before. We asked an employee for directions because we didn’t have time to play around. And she said she couldn’t help us and she told us to go through a door and ask the person in there. Again never being there before we trusted the employee and went through the door and couldn’t go back through. No one wanted to answer our questions on where the lady we were traveling with was at and how we could get back to our flight. We finally stumbled to TSA after no help and tried to explain what happened and how we had 5 mins to find her and get on the plane. She rolled her eyes and just said you are no more important that me and go to the back of the line. I then asked to could we speak to some so we can come to a solution and find the women that was traveling with us. She just turned around and went back over towards the scan machine. We got in line and missed our flight. We was in the line for almost 40 minutes before we were able to get to the front to go through. Then the same lady was being weird. We did the basics to get on the plane and then wanded me and my mom down twice. Then came up to me while talking to my mom and told me to tell her to listen to her or else she’ll have to embarrass her. And I asked her what was that supposed to mean and she chuckled and walked back over there to my mom. After that was all over a man came over to talk to us but it didn’t get very far probably less than a minute and said he was coming back and never did. I have severe anxiety and severe depression so this situation was very overwhelming for me. After sitting on a bench for a few hours I finally got some help. There was only one amazing person that I’ve come across. He was a young man and he helped me get another flight for me, my mom, and my sister. And if left an hour after I conversed with him he told me that it was going to be okay and really helped me figure it all out. I wish I remembered him name because he really deserves recognition and a raise. DFW honestly doesn’t deserve an employee like him and I hope he comes across a better job with even better pay.  TSA = Terribly Sorry A**holes!",1
Worst airport experience ever.  Lack of communication.  Constant gate changes and conflicts on monitors as to which gate we needed to be at.  Had 4 gate changes.  Sat at security check in for 2.5 hours due to the airlines not communicating with us. Half of the security area smelled like poop. The vending machines wouldn't take our money.  The whole experience here just straight up sucked.,1
Bathrooms with broken doors and stalls is very not ok.  Very 3rd world country.  Not even in a 3rd world country u will find this horrible amenities. Fix it. No privacy,1
"If I could give negativity I would. delaying my flight 16 times rescheduling it to that night (missed my shuttle to my hotel ) then you canceled that, decided that the next flight I I could do was two days  away so all my money I wasted on my hotel in costa rica was wasted so now I’m stuck here with no hotel no compensation and they can’t even tell me where my 100$ checked bag is  , if you think customer service would help you would be wrong because it took 5 and a half hours to reach the  front just too have them say we’re out of luck ,you could call too but they took off the prompts so after 45 min on hold it hangs up on you 0/10 would never come here again I would never use American Airlines again!!!!!",1
"I haven't had the best experiences with flying through Dallas and in the future will opt for a longer layover if I'm connecting flights through here.

My first experience was in October 2023. My friends and I had to wait to deboard, wait to get off, wait for baggage to come off the plane, wait at the carousel, and then had to catch a tram to get to the other side of the airport and sprint through to reach final boarding at our gate. It was brutal.

My second experience was just just recently and the entire plane had to wait to get towed to our gate, wait to deboard, and then rush to get to my connecting flight. Again brutal but luckily for timezone changes, I made it. Maybe they were short staffed but it made me anxious while waiting to catch my next flight.

The pros, if you have the time, there are lots of restaurants and stores to check out if you're into that.

Pack your patience here at this airport. Good luck.",1
It is a good thing there are a lot of shops and eateries to distract from all the frustration and disorganization  of actually catching a plane. I needed the distractions to help me with my sanity while a certain airline had me play time and gate wack-a- mole. A 21st-century PA system could help. I will go out of my way to avoid this airport.,1
"Very poor service overall. No after hours services. Plane was diverted here. I very much doubt that I'll come back here voluntarily. Nothing open in the morning when passengers are arriving. Vouchers given out by airlines not accepted by taxis, restaurants, and issues with the hotels which indicates clear lack of communication on the airport's part as the airport staff were coordinating. TSA has no pre check lane and argues where other, larger and more competent airports have no issues. Overall a pretty awful airport. I'd say on par with JFK for terrible operations in a city that deserves more.",1
"We just arrived on an international flight here at DFW, along with at least two other large planes and there's about 700 people waiting to go through customs with one...ONE!!!!...customs agent available for US citizens and one available for foreign nationals.  ONE each!!!  And there's at least 30 stalls that could be staffed.  I'm absolutely speechless.  This is the first.. and will be the LAST time I ever arrive international into DFW.  People are enraged because they're missing their connections.  It took us 60 mins to get through the line and we were near the front.  DFW is regularly one of the worst airport experiences in the country, but even this is a new low.  My advice: plan on AT LEAST 3 hours for an international connection at DFW.  Better yet, go through Atlanta, JFK, LAX, Minneapolis, Detroit...anywhere else but DFW for an international flight.",1
"First impressions of this typical murican airport: others can see you take a dump with this nice hole in the stall...
Other countries be jealous of this fREedoM",1
"First : I had 21 minutes to get to Terminal A ( where the heck is this Terminal
Second: I have to transfer myself to that on a train (I’m not familiar with this place very well
Their:When I got in the terminal and the gate… guess what the airplane at that gate is going to Fort Worth
It is 6:53
I asked to a gentleman to indicate me what’s going on with this scenario. He replied to me to go and check on electronic device for my gate and details….
We found that my gate, 34, was updated to 24. ,yeahhh
Finally I got a the updated GATE, 24, and ask the employees what was going on…
The answer was you here!!! Like who the heck is caring…., no one you are on your own
That’s it
Now imagine yourself in a totally this situation and wouldn’t realize that your airplane is not the intended one
Anyone would it be stranded, there losing their plane
These are little details, however, someone needs to correct them

It is 7 minutes after the departure…..",1
"Health concern!!!! Do NOT eat here in terminal A- Came here to order with my family and tall black male worker in the kitchen was eating the food in the kitchen licking his fingers and serving food. When I saw this we Cancelled my order and went elsewhere- manager also saw him and told him to stop. Employee thought it was a joke and was waiving bye to us - glad to know you licking your fingers and eating the food your serving to people is a joke to you. Disgusting!!!

Happened 10/29/23 around 1845 hours",1
"TSA will steal your expensive watches and sunglasses. Their claims department will offer a laughable 50% value if you are lucky enough to get a response 7 months later like I did. Don’t waste your money on pre check membership just do CLEAR and video record your bags going through if possible. Put pressure on the TSA employees to stop stealing and maybe the negative attention will spark some preventative action. If your items suddenly go missing, call the police immediately because TSA will protect their own. The police will look at the security camera footage and protect you where TSA will not. Make sure your stolen items are returned this way.",1
"I just boarded my plane and had a very negative experience minutes before this. First I witnessed a little elderly lady get treated very rudely by a security woman, for absolutely no reason I might add. The woman seemed to just genuinely hate her job and was not friendly to anyone that passed her. Then in the same security line they kept my purse without saying a word to me, there were so many people pushing and I was a complete dingdong and didn’t realize it until I was on the skyline. After circling all the way around I got back to security where they kept my keychains, I did have pepper spray (which I didn’t mind tossing and should have realized was not allowed but I’ve taken it with me on many plane rides in the past, including one 2 hours before this and never have been questioned) but my keychain my dear friend got me had to be tossed as well which made me very emotional. The only option they gave me was mail it to myself and miss my flight or toss it, what a great system they have in place.. normally people greet you and are friendly in airport but I only recall one staff member actually greet me. I’m glad I’m just passing through, because this airport was just depressing.",1
"By far one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at the international airport. For one, the American airline wouldn’t let people get off the airplane due to the shortages in gates! Are you kidding me?  It took about an hour before everyone were able to finally get off the plane. For two, Getting through the customs and security check point also added another  2 hours which made me miss the connecting flight. Explained the officer im going to miss the flight yet they were taking all the time in the world and joked with each other while every other passengers were stressing. Nobody wants to spend their valuable time at the airport let alone spending a night there after missing a flight. The American airline did absolutely nothing to accommodate except for rebooking the flight the following morning. I will not be booking the flights through AA nor flying out of DFW ever again!",1
"Why the bad attitude towards decent people who had questions about their flight plan? We asked one question. Hands thrown in the air like, ""Duh. Dummies."" And so much unwarranted sass. Can we ask about our ticket information without degradation? No worries. We don't want to be in Texas for too long. Hopefully, they have a better year and find positive moments to power them through their long work week.",1
"I truly loathe DFW airport.  Everything from actually getting there, to the parking, to the merry-go-round terminals, to limited Pre-Check and CLEAR check-ins, lack of the number of electric plugs at the gates, and the worst part - the inevitable delays.",1
"Had to stop at this airport on my way back from a Mexico trip.

1. During baggage claim I was told by 7 different people where my luggage would be and needed claim and recheck it in so I  waited 1 hour only to be told that my luggage wasnt going to  need to be claimed and rechecked because it was already going through to my final destination

2. The staff here are really passive aggressive and will tell people all different things because the clearly do not communicate

3. Because of the unnecessary waiting and confusion amoung staff it added to so much wait time for going through airport security and I  was very close to missing my connecting flight. And this also happened up multiple other people and I witness numerous people get so angerly frustrated because they missed their connecting flights.

I would really give this airport 0 stars, but I was happy that they had a Buffalo wild Wings (food was really good but the hostess didn't let me know they were closing at 8:45pm and it was 8:42.)",1
"The police at customs for non us citizens was very racist and rude. First, I ask how long the queue was because I had another flight, and they looked at me up and down and said a few minutes ugh, after some hours I had the talk with the police person to continue the walk to my flight. I think she should be more calm and understand that after a long flight and English not being your first language it's a bit more tricky to explain. She threatened me with not letting me walk to my plane.",1
"Worst airport I have ever been in. I have traveled all over the country and have never experienced such a terrible airport. Gates moved 9 times and spent 10 hours in an airport! Avoid traveling through, to or near this place...it's a trap.",1
"Beware the taxi drivers. I didn't use my map (my fault) to see how far the hotel was from the airport (it was 3.6 miles). He drove around for 20 minutes, turning a quick fare into a $45 dollar ride. I should have just used uber for $8 plus tip but didn't want to walk over to the ride pickup area (again my fault).  The taxi stand person at the airport even got the cab at the baggage area..",1
Possibly the WORST place for layover! All our American Airlines kept getting delay over and over again. The lines were long and no one was helpful in anyway. WORST PLACE. Do not come for layover,1
"The saving grace is staff are respectful and nice. However it is a horrible airport, it is dirty nasty, disgusting, and horrible place to go. Full of homeless people, drinks, and methheads. Everything is too far away from each-other, and is a hassle to get too. Panera and Starbucks the only edible places in the airport are far away from most gates and difficult to get too.",1
"I’m convinced that DFW is one of Dante’s Circles of Hell, although I’m not yet sure which.

Planes are never ever on time, whether incoming or outgoing. It’s always packed and disgusting. Don’t expect to not stand in urine in the restroom because they don’t get cleaned. You’re not going to be able to buy any refreshments because the workers apparently get carted out in ambulances from the stress.

Just abysmal.",1
"This airport may be huge, have plenty amenities, and restaurant's but the customer service is horrible. My grandfather and brother, were flying back to Arkansas with a layover here is Dallas. My grandfather had wheelchair assistance on his flight at booking and leaving out of Tucson, Arizona but it was such a hassle to get anyone to provide a wheelchair and get him and my brother to their Gate in a timely manner. After arriving in Dallas, an attendant said they would have someone bring him his wheelchair and they didn't come in time which resulting in them missing their flight to Little Rock, AR. After contacting American Airlines, they only had two flights available. One of which only had one seat left and the other not departing until 6:45 PM!! Which means, my grandfather and brother would have to sit in the airport for 8 hours to wait for the next flight. This is heart wrenching and extremely unacceptable. My grandfather is 67 years old and my teenage brother is 15, and already afraid of flying so what a great experience. The airports are just going down, there's no customer service, no more helpful employees to even tell you where to go or where you need to be. It's just very disappointing and something needs to be done ASAP!!!",1
"If I could give it less than one star I would, super big but poorly signposted, we missed a connecting flight because we came from another country, and there was only one guard to review immigration documents, for more than 300 people and a huge airport, bad organization, lack of signs and personnel for information. I have traveled from almost all airports in the UNITED STATES and this is by far the worst.  I recommend that you reject any stopover at this airport if you don't want to have a horrible bad time.",1
"Security dumped out all of our toddler and infant drinks, refused to screen them, completely against the policy of the Federal TSA. Absolute chaos at this airport, recommend avoiding for any other location.",1
"I had the nuttiest experience here. The flights were NOT correct on the screens for multiple gates. Then our plane changed gates but it was not reflected in the airport's big gate information screen. People were running back and forth between their supposed gates trying to find the plane, which we thought was boarding then. Then finally after the boarding time was past, we started getting texts saying our flight was delayed and the gate changed, although even the gate it was supposed to be at did not say our correct destination so we were still confused. THEN, after waiting through multiple delays, they finally started boarding us, however, the gate attendants refused to give multiple people enough time to buy their pass for oversized baggage! They ended up closing the door on some of us, and some customers were screaming and crying! I felt like I was in another country trying to board a war plane. It was just completely bizarre. They said it was $99 to rebook, WHICH WAS MORE THAN THE FLIGHT COST in the first place!!
I will never fly that airline or go to this airport ever again if I can possibly help it. It was totally unreal.",1
"Terrible!
I was carrying 2 apples that my mom put on my bag and when I was passing customs the beagle dog smell'em!
So I must to go to check with the Agriculture department and they made me waste like 25 minutes there waiting, because they were taking their sweet time as it was late and they were tired 😫
So after they cleared me I must to run to find the gate like crazy as I was really late!
I'll give them zero stars if I can!
USA agriculture claim that they protect their nasty food, but they are crazy, their food is full of poison and GMOs!!!!😡😫
USA buy all the produce from México! What aré they talking about????",1
"I travel to Texas about once a year and usually pass through the DFW airport. Today, during a long layover, I thought I would enjoy a Dr Pepper. I'm in Texas, after all. After walking by every shop and restaurant within a reasonable distance of my gate, I could only find Coke products. It is insane and an affront to capitalism that an airport, especially of this size, would limit the offering of soda to the millions of passengers that travel through here every year. In a state that so strongly values freedom and capitalism, I couldn't imagine making the decision to block other sodas from being offered. To say I'm upset would be a huge understatement. I hate Coke anyhow, and am even less inclined to buy it anywhere else now, too. I'd rather drink water!!!!!",1
"Been through DFW numerous times.  This just irks me!  The walkways and escalators were in this same shape on 12/30 and obviously stayed the same through today,  1/4/23.  No help with carts in site in the underground tunnel out to gate E30.  Really, DFW?  Best you can do?  Highly frustrated from someone with a little mobility issue.  DFW, you can do better!",1
Really bad experience.  I landed in Dallas on time after an international 10 hour long flight with American Airlines.  It is incomprehensible to me how the gate was occupied by another airline.  After 30 minutes of waiting on the tarmac we finally were routed to the adjacent gate and had to wait another 15 minutes for the agent to move over one gate.  Not sure who’s to blame for that.  I’d add that the AA personnel didn’t utter a single word of apology throughout the whole wait.  It feels like when things are so bad there is more than one culprit.,1
Please hire kinder and more professional Prospect wheel chair and cart service personnel. I’ve witnessed and have experienced multiple times people are unprofessional and rude to passengers. For a big airport this is not ok. They leave people stranded and even denied them services. They rudely service the cart yelling and whistling at passengers. Yes there are a lot of people but also there is a professional way of doing their job. Either hire better people or train them better.,1
"OLD...VERY OLD AIRPORT. Very confusing place to drive in. Very poor road signage. Most directional road signs are missing, or they are very difficult to see and understand. All of the road pavement is in very poor condition.  If you fly out of DFW and return back to DFW, you may not return to the same terminal that you departed from.  Curbside pickup and drop-off may not be available at all terminals. Also, if your gate changes, you may be in for a long walk, or you need to change terminals. You may need to use the Tram, which is not close to the boarding area . TEXAS DUMP!!!!! Love Field isn't any better.",1
"I'm in Terminal E. Yes this place is huge but they don't have any tables or anywhere to work. I am stuck here for 4 hours with no place to work. One of the few airports I've been to that has this issue.

They have some Coca-cola bubble but they don't provide outlets.

They have nooks with bench seating but no table.

Such a shame and a waste of my time. This place is so backwards.",1
"I was supposed to have a wheelchair to my connecting flight on Saturday December 23rd and again today December 26th. I didn't get one at all on Saturday but had 2 hours to get to my connecting flight
Today I had from plane to the seating area and was told to wait for someone else to take me to connecting flight. I was dropped there and ended up having to walk across the airport with only 20 minutes to takeoff.
Guess what. I didn't make it I have 2 bad knees and can't run.
So I missed my connecting flight and of course no more flights until noon tomorrow
Not happy.
I can't afford a hotel so hopefully I can stay in airport",1
"Awful,
American airlines issued my infant ticket without working parent ticket.
Told the gate he was on the skyline, told me he had 3 minutes, she let 3 people on.  As my partner was telling her he made it, she ignored him,  told the man next to her to close the door, never talked to my partner or even made eye contact. Nothing.
I can't even rent a car because they have my carseat. So after a 15 hour journey back to the states with 2 children and a disabled parent, here we are...",1
Incoming flight 45 minutes late. 40 minute line at customs. TSA precheck closed. Connecting flight leaves 5 minutes early. We actually made it to the plane on time but they were closing the door as we ran up. 22 people missed the flight.,1
"The videos were taken at terminal E17, May 18, 2023 at 13:15 local time. I was at the gate looking out the window and I watched this process go on the entire time he loaded this luggage cart it wasn’t just once or twice, it was every single case, it’s almost as if he wanted personally see if he could break the luggage through the luggage cart.
I get nobody can and should take the blame for all damage done to cases, but this was deliberately and unnecessary roughness, comparable to a younger sibling having to do the chore that the older sibling got out of.

Completely foolish, especially since it was out in plain sight for any paying customer to see.

I know this is taught over and over again in training on how and why to be carful handling luggage because everyone has a camera just waiting for you to mess up. Well guess what you just messed up for the world to see.

Other than the worker it’s hard to know who should take the blame for this, the airport or the airlines, I personally feel the airport seeing he was not associated with any airline, but it needs to be shown so people (and the airlines) can really see how the luggage is really handled, and so the managers can take corrective action, as this costs tens of thousands of dollars if not more every year and causes serious frustrations for everyone.",1
"If I could I would leave a -5 (NEGATIVE 5 star) to Volaris airline. The two ladies that are at the front one with black hair and the other with blonde I believe her name was Jacky. They both were so disrespectful from the beginning. Their customer service was ridiculously horrible and illogically incorrect when I only respectfully requested help in my situation with my documents for my daughters to fly internationally. Calling me names and crazy and blaming it was my fault for not checking with them first when I believe that’s why I was there at the airport to ask for help in the first place.
Both those ladies never helped to find the best solution to my situation and I believe they need to go back to classes on how to treat and speak and assist a customer more so to how to do their job because what it looked like to me was more like I get a good paycheck and I just go home and sit in a chair al day on my phone and I could careless the people that I “help to check in” attitude.
My daughters and I were suppose to fly out in the middle of the week and the other lady that’s was not helping me directly suggested to change my date to the next week. ( a full week , seriously?!??!) well I said immediately No that is too far out and pointless since we can all come to our senses and logic that school/classes start on Monday the following week, right?!  So she then suggests to change it to 2 days out from Wednesday two days out I’m pretty sure it’s Friday , not Saturday Sunday or Monday or Tuesday. Let alone other ladies that were behind these two women , were much nicer helped me by suggesting one day change or two. But no because the other woman that was not infront of the stand were I was supposedly being helped had to suggest ironically and senselessly a date way out their like in space or something. And to top it off disrespecting me and my daughters my family with name calling and insults of supposedly being a liar for suggesting a sooner date vs taking forcefully a date she suggested that I neglected. When all I wanted was to set a better date to get my things situated with their feedback. I ended up loosing my respect as a customer , my dignity or believeing Volaris is a good airline , no I doubt their customer service and their employees at least these two women bc they were not treating me like a customer, they’re treated me and my family like a piece of trash that they could careless if I took the flight or not. That’s not acceptable. I requested a full refund immediately, and they are deciding either if it’s reasonable to do so. O and they can’t change their mistake to correct it with out having to charge me yet another full price ticket for each of my family just so that I don’t “miss” the flight.  Plus another extra charge of more than $110 for their services of changing it, supposedly. That’s what I would call ripoff’s and stealers and inhuman treatment to someone that’s new to the airline Volaris and to fortunately never will I or my family fly with these careless disrespectful agency and i won’t tolerate any more disrespect in my face and in front of my daughters like that ever again. I hope the airline sees this comment and immediately sends their staff to customer service classes and do extreme check offs on how to assist a customer before they ruin and force a single mother to loose over $1000 on flights and the chance to see their family again.",1
"Substandard. And considering it is one of the major airline hubs and an international gateway as well it is quite an embarrassment. If you happen to have a late night connection, say from terminal D to terminal C, the train is out of service after 10 pm, thus you have to make a walk which takes 30-45 minutes long.  Lounges are also closed (this is an international airport, serving many connections!) And, if you are unfortunate enough to have a flight canceled, the only 2 places you can rest within the airport book up within minutes and are outrageously expensive. Not a good place to make late night connections, specially after an international flight.",1
"Compared to other major hubs I visit around the country, this airport is always overcrowded, filthy, most staff (airport, airline, resturant) are unpleasant, and there are no updated amenities here like common power plugs or updated sitting areas.  Unfortunately, this airport has largely unchanged for the last 20 years.  For as much people that come thru here, updates to the older terminals should have taken place multiple times by now.",1
"Absolutely useless. I had a connecting flight and asked for help multiple times so that I could get to the gate on time. Only one person tried to help me, but they couldn't do much. Everyone else brushed me off. I missed my flight. Never coming back if I can help it.",1
"This airport is filthy!!! The men’s rooms are disgusting and old!! Torn apart, urine stained floors. Sinks that don’t work, trash overflowing!!!

They allow restaurants to GOUGE the travelers… $4.25 for Water!!??!! $15.00 for a To Go sandwich!!??!! Everything is outrageous set in filth!!! Rude and lazy employees everywhere doing nothing but checking out their phones tucked away in corners!!! I see it all as someone who is very observant in my surroundings.

DFW is OLD and GROSS….i will definitely try to AVOID this place a hub like avoiding getting COVID!!!!",1
"Discriminations! Just facts as followed

April 2nd 2023. 9pm to 10pm. DFW airport Terminal D

American airlines delayed flights continuously due to severe weather storm warning. We arrive 1.5 hours before our flight from dfw to msp.

The line at the security check was long as the amazon river can last and wait up to 24 minutes. While we were lining up, there were a group of individuals accessing the line for wheelchairs and crew members only. All of them are not on wheelchairs and healthy looking individuals including a few gentlemans in their 40s, few ladies and a few teenagers and all are whites. Despite the snake line on the main waiting line, the two security check point guards have allowed them to by pass! Why is that?! Several of us in the line look over at the sign board to confirm that we have see the information on the sign board correctly.

The incident of cutting through the line continues until a group of 4 Asian try to do so and was flatly denied?! What is the rationale for this behaviour? In addition, we have also confirmed thay the line for DFW fast pass is on the other side and would require a personnel to be in presence and present those who use the fast pass as such. Yet, we do not see any personnel at the scene other than these people try to cut in the line and was allowed to do so

After that, it is annouced that at 10pm the line will be closed. Those who do not make to the cut off entrance are asked to leave! Our heart break for them why there is no one, airport individuals or airlines individuals direct the flow and let people wait as such! Yet somehow some individuals who do not follow rules and use their “white” privilege to cut in?!

We also noticed the two security guard who have allowed a group of people mentioned above cutting in the line shouted at any attempts to join the line after this point even though the lady told him that she only have 15 mins before departure. They were also very aggressive at a lady who r in the line and there r only abt 2 people in front of her that she only have 10 mins left before departure time.

We should question the two security guards practice of discrimination by allowing some to cut off the line while others cannot. We also question if it is just happen to be a coincident that the groups of people allowed in are al white while asian, black and other races are not allowed to be in.

The person of the pose is to (1) call out DFW and airlines lack of support for its passenger and (2) voice out the human rights to be treated with fair and dignity instead of succumb to those who were given the power to deny or grant the access to the departure terminal. Regardless of races and if one has not paid for premium service, they need to join the line! If there is a rush for those who are really in need then this needs to apply to everyone and not selected individuals! We are in the land of freedom not oppression and discrimination.",1
If I could I would give zero stars! This airport is the most ghetto & rachet airport I’ve ever been to. None of the employees want to do their job. None of the restaurants or stores in the airport are open for the customers. They had delays & cancellations that were not reported until last minute or they just didn’t report them. They have places in the airport that are falling apart & I felt unsafe I’m certain areas. OSHA needs to come I’m there to see that there are so many hazards.,1
"Terminal Link Shuttle is completely overbooked and full, so you have to wait for multiple shuttles before one can actually pick you up. I am still waiting at 1030pm with my 9yo child. 4 shuttles have stopped and haven’t let us get on.",1
"02/14/24 time 12:30pm
My family flew from Qatar and their stop was at this airport, state department who escorted them supposed to help her get on board to her final destination, unfortunately they denied and led her stranded on her own she don’t speak English and is her first time in the country, so i called the airport to see if there’s any help the customer service with a very weird attitude told me, we can’t help in anyways just call police. At international airport employee with such a sick a short tempered attitude is not what i expected.",1
"This is a terrible airport, my mom had an internatinal fly and bougt some stuff at Dutty Free , the bag was sealed she has her recipt , she pass for Miami Airport all was fine, but here at Dallas OMG they make mi mom cries, they was rude , unprofessional and the my 73 years old mom trow away the stuff she bought. The TSA lady who checked was very aggresive wirh her and make her feel unconfuble  touching her everywhere. OMG when I heard my mom crying I wished I have wings and fly overthere to protect her. Terrible terrible expirience",1
"I don’t usually leave bad reviews, but the experience we had when we went through the airport on January 4th was just terrible. Traveling with kids is not easy in general, but the super long lines, changing gates 3 times for our delayed flight, and dealing with rude TSA agents made it even worse. Some kindness for exhausted travelers would be nice.",1
"Flew into DFW airport last summer, arriving at terminal C.
Wow, it was like landing in a 3rd world country. The restrooms wreaked of pee, all of the urinals were overflowed on the floor, there was a guy that fell in the terminal and people were just walking around him as he laid on the floor. The food court was disgusting - dirty, smelly and very unappealing. The only thing missing was a guy with a herd of goats wearing a robe, hat and carrying a long staff/hook.

Well done Dallas. What was the crown jewel of an airport in the 70's is now equal the Mogadishu airport - well, minus the RPGs.

One word: ""Yuck""",1
One of the worst airports in the country. Especially terminal E is cramped up near baggage claims. No train link between terminals available unless you check in and go through security which is very unusual as compared to airports in north east… so it sucks when you arrive at a different terminal as you can’t take train and you have to take a bus to go to your car if it’s parked at another terminal (flights change departure and arrival terminals often). Bus availability between terminal sucks. DFW Parking will charge you twice - on your toll tag and prepaid parking. Long lines for bag drops . Everything about this airport sucks,1
"Big airport and nice but the service was very bad. Dfw airport should do better. The wheelchair service are very poor service the people already get paid to work there but they all expected the traveler to tip them. I felt like I got force to have to tip everyone who have push my mom wheel chair. When we get to Korea airport the worker didn’t expect nothing from us and they are very friendly and helpful.
So be warn if you fly DFW airport make sure you have some cash or you will hear them talking in different laughing because you didn’t give them money 😡",1
"I am about done with the airport employees. SUPER RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL first time landing when you pick up your baggage with a firearm/ my husband is military. he showed his id as a form of identification and the lady was very rude saying he shouldn’t be pulling out his military id because he isn’t in uniform. EXCUSE ME?? My husband is in military business what in the world? And on top of that he does not have a Tx id??? Well that isn’t all, when i was going in for security checking, the lady checking ids on 5/1/24 @6:00am to go in on Side B-15 i was priority, she kept skipping me for some reason? And she was pointing at the poeple behind me to go??? Like what? I am in line first and then when i said hey i am priority, i dont know who you are pointing at to go she said “NOT YOU MAAM” and then she told one of her colleagues to check me in because I didn’t want to follow her rules?? LIKE WHAT LADY I AM NEW TO FLYING WITH MY HUSBAND ON MILITARY BUISNESS and that was so embarrassing I didn’t even ment to be rude shw just kept pointing at random people behind me.",1
What a nightmare. Customs held us up (due to understaffed) and the flight left 26 connecting passengers behind. Will avoid this airport if possible and side note - the American airline ladies are not helpful and extremely rude. Boarding ended @ 8:40 and we were at the gate at 8:44. 🤬,1
"Its 1030, the airport is packed, every monitor says restaurants are open yet nothing is actually open.   Thanks for directing customers to faraway terminals in search of things not actually open.  Its like they dont even want to make money.  One of the worst ran airports.",1
"One of the worst airports I ever been, dirty, old, not comfortable.. feel so bad here",1
The airport was very clean. But when  our flight arrived  from  Miami to Dallas.  We found out that the  flight from Dallas to Tyler had already left. Very disappointing  Very disgusted.  Told us that we would have to sleep  in the airport.  That is not right.  American airlines  owes us a reimbursement for the  flight  from  Dallas to Tyler.  Both flights was on American  Airlines.,1
Very unorganized airport.  Sky cab was not open at 6:00 am.  Woman at luggage check in told me my carry on was too big so I had to put my stuff in different luggage and throw mine out.  Get to terminal and 100's of people had carry on that size.  I am one pissed fool.,1
"Worst airport I have ever flown in or out of. Long lines, terribly marked, and you rides can never locate you because of the confusion.  I will say that the workers there were very nice and helpful...so that helped ease the pain of this facility.",1
I fly all over the country and this is the worst airport!  TSA is a joke and they close all of their stations at 9 pm. GET there early,1
"Worst airport ever if you’re coming into Dallas. Once you land, you’ll taxi for a minimum of 45 min. Sometimes up to an hour or more. I’ve never flown into a more inefficient airport. You’re prob better off jumping out of the plane and hoping you parachute to where you have to land than hoping your flight doesn’t taxi for 2 hours. Fly into love field instead. The idiots that run this airport need to be fired immediately.",1
"We Arrived from overseas at 7:00 am and there was 300 people waiting in line for Customs and only 2 Custom Agents working. TSA was the same way except they were callous and rude.
Many People were missing connecting flights. Totally unacceptable & obviously mismanaged. TSA agent said, "" if you don't like it tell your elected officials.""
Awful...",1
"The employees here are inexcusably irritable and rude. They are very uninterested in helping anyone, I spoke to 3 different people and got no answer each one of them at the desk acted annoyed they had to help me and at first when I greeted them they ignored me and my question. And yes I spoke clear and confidently so they heard me.

Been in the Army 10 years and traveled a lot, this airports staff need an attitude adjustment.",1
"This place it too big, and too complicated. It doesn't mesh with Google or Apple maps to make it around. I had to spend money to go around and around in circles. Now, the staff, all super helpful. Great staff. Great people. But I'm from a major city and in and out of airports. This is the most confusing place. It's worse than a horse in a unicorn stable",1
"Extremely poor service in Passport Control.  Huge lines, little help, only 2 lanes open out of around 12 for U.S. citizens.  Come on people, you know this is Spring Break time.  I suspect hundreds of people missed their connecting flights because of poor staff planning and poor signage.",1
"The airport, where you have to stand in que for 4 hours with no rest, and still miss your connecting flight. The staff dont care. I've been travelling a lot, but this is the worst experience ever. I'll recommend everyone to stay away.",1
Doesn’t deserve one star. Absolute garbage. Needs more employees and rules need to be clearly stated. Wasted so much time due to some lacking employees misinformation,1
Awful experience moved 6 times in 2 hours on trip home. Trip out moved 4 times and had 3 hour delay. I hope I never see this airport again,1
If you ever have an AA flight out of gate D1 prepare for at least a 30 minute commute to get there. Flights leaving from here should come with a disclaimer and have a defibrillator on hand for all the elderly and out of shape Americans sprinting to make their connections.,1
"This airport has tanked. They have new gates and restrooms but a great airport is measured by its customer service which I would include security.

As a quadriplegic I have am expectation to have some form of mobility assistance available. The airline AA saps they called but none picked up. I walked 22 gates, got accosted by TSA and barely made my plane because of how long all that took.

American Airlines was no better. There were 3 empty course carts unattended between security gate A-15 and A-38. I would have thought someone would have met me at security. There could have been a disabled chair or two at the gate too but there was not.

TSA followed their procedures but did not pay attention we were at the precheck when he asked me to take off my shoes when that was not the procedure.  Then it was decided to park a chair in the middle of the bag claim so everyone could watch all my private get groped. Not right

DFW used to be my home. I am disappointed to see what has happened in 10 short years",1
"I love when people are helpful and informative, unfortunately I’ve had multiple experiences right before the security check point where they made me feel dumb instead of helping me understand the process, very arrogant.
My family members felt the same way and unfortunately, it’s only here at the DFW airport.",1
"I fly twice a month, and unfortunately travel through Dallas for most of my connections. DFW is by far the most dysfunctional airport I encounter. I catch a connecting flight through DFW somewhere around 20 times per year, and at least 90% of my flights have issues resulting in delays. Avoid DFW whenever possible.",1
"My experience at DFW Airport was nothing short of a nightmare as I was discriminated against by accessibility staff. I arrived on Emirates flight 221 on Oct 25, 2023 at 10:05 AM. Even though I am in my 20’s, I had requested wheelchair assistance well in advance due to a recent surgery on my right leg, which left me unable to stand for extended periods as per my surgeons advice. Despite my genuine need for help, the treatment I received from the airport accessibility staff was utterly appalling, discriminatory and ageist.

Upon disembarking from the plane, I was one of the first passengers to exit from the business class cabin. I identified myself to the wheelchair personnel, only to be met with mockery. One of the employees even had the audacity to laugh at my request, and say that I am too young to need a wheelchair. It wasn't until I insisted that they reluctantly provided a wheelchair. This initial encounter was both humiliating and unprofessional.

The situation took an even darker turn as I was pushed off the jet bridge. Unbeknownst to the staff member pushing me, I understand Arabic, and he foolishly began to converse in Arabic with his colleague. They started calling me a liar and saying I should walk instead. I was handed off to a different staff member who pushed me through customs, I expressed my gratitude to him and informed him that I could manage the short distance to the luggage area on my own since there shouldn't be any standing time from here.

In the luggage area, the same employees who had insulted me earlier in Arabic confronted me once again. This time, they spoke loudly in English and they were joined by a female colleague. They belittled me, labeling me a liar. Their comments and behavior were not only unprofessional but also outright offensive. The female employee went as far as to question why I had requested a wheelchair, saying I should walk instead. I tried to explain that I had recently undergone surgery and couldn't stand for extended periods, but their response was dismissive and antagonistic.

It's inconceivable that airport staff, particularly those responsible for accessibility services, would engage in such ageist and discriminatory behavior. This incident highlighted a clear lack of training and lack of managerial oversight. The disrespectful, ageist, and discriminatory treatment I received from DFW Airport accessibility staff was not only unacceptable but deeply concerning. Immediate action should be taken to address this issue, and those involved should be held accountable for their actions. No traveler should ever have to endure such discrimination and humiliation when seeking assistance at an airport.",1
"Can't wait to get back to home, my travel experience on the way here was so phenomenal and fast and the TSA agents were kind to the fact I was traveling with two young children. My experience at this airport set the tone and it was not a good one. TSA was unnecessarily mean and impatient. I mean I only have two hands, two kids, and 3 bags to maintain. Our stuff was put neatly into buckets but came out flying all over the place I was trying to grab all our stuff as fast as I could and get yelled at for placing the buckets underneath the table as the passenger before me did I said sorry, just following everyone else. He said don't follow everyone else and as I leaned over I dropped somthing and he said don't drop stuff on the floor. Like are you serious right know Paul blart???? All I could say is, rude.",1
"Absolutely awful for people with a disability. They dump you at a terminal and leave you there for hours. No one comes to check on you or ask if you need anything (water, the restroom, food). WC service takes forever and some of them are rude. I pay a lot of money and am treated terribly here. Also, it’s very unsanitary and the restroom is nasty.",1
"This is by far the worse airport I've ever flown in our out of in my life! Completely unorganized, communication is terrible, I've used cleaner port-a-potties at Mardi gras compared to the bathrooms in this airport. If I never see this place again in my life it'll be too soon.",1
Worst airport ever. Employees are not helpful and American Airlines is a joke. They cancelled my flight when people were already boarded on the plane after they changed the gate multiple times. Waited in customer service line all night for them to say they can’t do anything about it.,1
"Biggest waste of space ever. Half the airport isn’t even used, and everything runs so slow and inefficient. It’s a ok looking airport but that’s about it…. If you’re tryna move quick you may be a while here.",1
"This is the filthiest, rundown, most disgusting airport anywhere I’ve ever traveled.  The security system is outdated.  There is no body scanner at TSA pre-check.  The TSA employees are obnoxious and need to be replaced.  This area looks as though it hasn’t been cleaned in years.  The restrooms in the DFW area are deplorable.   This airport will make you feel like you are in a third world country!",1
"I took frontier airlines 10/22/2023 from ATL to DFW. I used my debit card to purchase onboard snacks. From there, someone(pretty sure it was the flight attendant that took my card), has been trying to use my debit card number to make purchases.  Thank God my bank has been turning down all 8 attempts. I tried to chat with customer support of the airline (because they don't have a phone number for you to actually speak with someone), and they had the audacity to inform me to call my bank and have my card replaced.  I immediately emailed them back, and informed them, that is being taken care of, but that does nothing about your employees using passenger's cc information. That's theft, and apparently they've done this before. That means passengers aren't safe to use there cards  on your flight due to the possibility of their information being stolen.  Beware, and try to avoid Frontier, they do nothing about their corrupt employees.",1
"On a midday Wednesday, my American Airlines flight from LAX had to wait 20 minutes for the assigned gate to be available making many of us run for our connecting flights. The air crew insisted we all needed to take the airport Skylink even though the AA directions to my gate said 18 minutes to walk to it. The Skylink was up an escalator, then five minutes more of walking and waiting for the elevated train that sped around and around, throwing anyone not holding a bar tightly off their feet, before finally coming back around to the section of gates I needed. Then an escalator back down a level and a short walk to my gate. Ladies rooms were scarce and had to find on this level. Seating at the gate was also very limited. Once aboard, we had to wait another 20 minutes from the push off to take off as the flights were so crowded. I will never book through DFW again and recommend against it for others.",1
DFW has to be the WORST airport. Bathrooms are always nasty and entire place shuts down with flights coming in. No point in closing skyline. Like I want to leave the airport and get on a bus to go to another terminal. Shape up DFW. You are embarrassing.,1
"TSA here is pretty wild. I had 2 8oz unopened (just bought) packs of Kingsford seasonings. I have TSA pre-check. They took almost 20mins to “test” the seasonings, PLUS I had to be searched very aggressively
from head to toe (for about 10mins) AND my 2 carry on bags completely ransacked and left in shambles - all for NOTHING! We almost missed our flight because of this nonsense. You are allowed to carry any seasonings under 12oz - there should have been no issue (read your own rules). This was completely insane and unprofessional - never again. Also, as soon as we walked up there were some employees talking loud negatively about people who were coming through their security lines. Unbelievable experience. TSA DFW get educated and teach your employees how to be professional on the job!",1
Horrible.  Our flight was delayed coming into DFW. No wheelchair service when we got there. Tried to rush to our connection.  Elevator was not working.  Escalator was not working. Had to go all the way to the other end to get an Elevator.  So of course we missed our flight.  What a mess this airport is.,1
"This place has multiple terminals that are never in use, and their employees never want to be there. It's clear when you look at their comments that they do not get paid enough. Now let's hop back to the fact that multiple terminals are never in use. The geniuses at DFW have decided that on top of charging people just to drop others off; they are going to build a 8 billion dollar terminal like that is going to attract people or be used effectively or efficiently. Regardless, more and more DFW just becomes a leech, prepare for your drinks and food to cost at least 30% more, and prepare your staff to be stretched even thinner than they are: especially when they can't even unload a plane before it starts raining, genius.",1
Needed wheelchair ♿ for to gates . Had it on my tickets. Had a 1hr 25 min layover had to walk bc never came. I almost missed my flight ✈️ mad at American airlines too. But today I say yall suck. Hated it. Don't expect help. Bc you won't get it . And I'm a vip with American airlines. Didnt get service I needed  my foot is 3x its size very disappointing.,1
"I am traveling through here today.  This place smells like a outhouse.  Fix your sewage system what a dump, used to be a world class airport.",1
"Enormous, disorganized , confusing passport control area that does not treat US permanent residents like citizens, as do other major airports. Shambolic security check area. I was late for my connection and I was handed a bright orange ""express connection"" envelope that was absolutely useless. This was confirmed by TSA agent who said "" they are only good to bother us"". Avoid this airport.",1
"Avoid this as a international transfer airport in and out. Dallas customs is grossly understaffed - we had 2 customer officers for 500 foreign travellers- they don’t give a hoot about you so you will miss your connection-need to book a hotel if all flights are full effectively incur extra costs .  we had 3.5 hours to transit but we had 2 hours in the queue. Coming back even worse - thunder storm delay and baggage had 1.25 mins to transfer from AA to Qantas, no hope in hell - luggage missing. LA has improved according to reports. Avoid Avoid …",1
"I hate airports.  I hate the useless TSA, the food, the prices, the non-helpful help.  Most of all, I hate the airlines.",1
"DFW Airport holds a special place in my heart. The bustling terminals, diverse cuisines, and constant hum of activity create a unique energy. Navigating through its vast spaces, I find joy in the seamless blend of cultures and the anticipation of exciting journeys. Every visit is a reminder of the world's interconnectedness, making DFW Airport more than just a travel hub—it's a gateway to adventure and discovery.but I'm in nigeria probably no one cares",1
"Worst airport in America. On 4/21/23 they closed terminal C with no guidance making hundreds of passengers miss their flight. Since their was no communication, all these passengers went in circles on the tram. All it takes is a little communication and we all could of gotten home to our families on time. Disappointed in the staff and management teams.",1
If I could give 0 stars I would. Got stranded here. No way to get a car or hotel. Tried to get back into terminal to atleast have a snack while I wait on equally terrible airline reschedule. All security gates closed all night. No way to get in. No security around. Nothing.,1
"I'd give em -5 stars if I could. These people are so rude to the guests, they are so entitled and disrespectful to everyone. I have been here for over 12 hours  and have been delayed multiple times since leaving Mcallen Airport. This place is so hateful",1
"I expect this won't be read, and I am not the first person to be voice these concerns, but there needs to be some a customer service training with the TSA and AA agents at this airport. My experiences over the last 12 hours with these people have been horrible! From the desk agent snapping at us because we had questions about flight delays longer than 6 hours, to the early morning TSA officer who was unbelievably rude when I asked where I needed to go since my delayed flight from the evening before now leaves at 5am, I got back to the airport at 3am (2 hours before as suggested) from the sketchy hotel they sent me to, but they don't open general boarding until 4am. I get they may deal with different personalities daily, but every person's story is different. Compassion or just a little bit of humility will go a long way to make sure a bad experience doesn't get worse.",1
"TSA officer, Robbins, who was working in customs on 2/09/25 at 7:50pm was incredibly rude and off putting. He clearly does not enjoy his job and in my opinion should retire (or be fired) immediately.",1
"Nobody really knows what’s going on and flights mostly get out on time, somehow.
Don’t get dropped at the wrong airline because you are not their problem 🥹 You will be left walking literal miles if you get dropped off at the wrong terminal. If you get stuck they have hotels on “campus” and they have a Whataburger, so not all is bad 🥴
Good luck keeping up with construction 🚧 and have a great flight ✈️",1
"My wife and I had a short 2hr layover in DFW recently and having never been to DFW, we figured we would walk the place and check it out.

There’s lots of restaurant so you won’t be short of food and drink.

The most glaring issue with DFW is the lack clean facility sanitation standards.

This is one of the dirtiest airports I’ve ever had the displeasure of visiting.

I hope Dallas City Mayor Eric Johnson addresses these issues swiftly and promptly as DFW is well below the faculty sanitation national average in my opinion.",1
Dropped my buddy off yesterday. They gave him a ticket to Arkansas (he purchased a ticket to North Carolina online) and made him pay an extra $400 to get the original ticket that he purchased. While being uncooperative and after a 30min argument. Now I'm having to go pickup his luggage because it was loaded into a plane headed to California. At this time no refunds or compensation has been issued. This level of incompetence shouldn't be allowed. Extremely unhappy.,1
"Some smushed faced lady in TSA wouldn’t let my son board the plane & he’s a minor…. I may have been going too fast when purchasing his ticket & put the wrong year for his birthdate. So the CONTOUR attendant helped me revise the ticket to get him through TSA. They nailed him about his age and he missed his flight and baggage is on the plane. This is the worse experience we’ve ever had and the same TSA lady let him go thru the back last week when he took this same flight. Now my son is pissedd because he can’t be with his family for the holidays because of this rude lady. We had to reschedule flight for December because all the flights are full for the week, what a waste of workers you guys have. They thinking he’s 18 and need state issued id but he’s still a minor because of one simple mistake. You guys suck",1
"Let’s just start by talking about how stinky and out of date Terminal C is. After arriving for my American Airlines flight at 7pm and having it delayed 2 times, my flight was finally delayed another time to 5:30am the next morning. Since it was 11pm by the time I made it to the counter to receive my hotel voucher, I chose to stay at the airport for fear of having to go to the hotel only to turn around and go back to the airport 4 hours later. I’m writing this from trash-covered chairs and stained floors. It honestly looks (and smells!) like an old roller rink in here. The carpet is badly stained, the tile floor cracked in many places and the water in the bathroom sink smelled like sewage. I hope DFW invests more in Terminal C. It’s not a pleasant place to be.",1
This is the last time I ever fly into Dallas. Every connection flight I have ever had here I have missed. I will no longer give my money to American Airlines and I will never connect in Dallas ever again. This is it DFW we are broken up.,1
"Terrible.  American Airlines is the WORST airline for customer service.  Missed a connecting flight last night because of THEM, and they couldn't care less.  If you are smart, use other airlines.  Delta always has worked with us when mistakes happen.  Not these incompetent people.",1
"Frontier Airlines cancelled our flight after delaying and updating gate and departure times 5 or 6 times. Finally after 6 hrs of waiting, the completely canceled the flight. All other flights were booked on Frontier and other airlines. Can't get our money back from hotel.",1
"Seats are set up like they are trying to keep homeless people from sitting on them, we’re not homeless our flights are delayed and we shouldn’t have to sleep on the floor.    You could just take every other arm rest out so the kids could lay on their parents lap since they are missing out on a holiday or Gam Gams funeral because of a delay.",1
Worst airport I’ve ever connected through. I will go out of my way from now on and even pay extra to never set foot in there ever again. I mean who closes their security station down and only has one ID scanner at the TSA entry point? Who doesn’t have the ability and technical upgrades to accommodate passengers who PAY extra to get through TSA screening checkpoints with ease? Get it together DFW or should I say Dallas FortWorthless!!!!,1
"My experience of getting through Security point was humiliated.  The staffs' tone of the voice are annoyed and judgmental.  I have followed the direction as they do and they think I am making a joke or something.  They put me aside and conduct body check and then make me to went through CT scan.  I have follow whatever they ask and they think I am joking or playing.
I was with my wife and 2 kids (7 and 2).
We have almost missed our flight.
These people needs to learn Customer service or Commonsense or something.
I am NOT a criminal.
I have served Navy 5 years.
How could these people treat us like dirtbags and criminals?
When we were coming from Las Vegas, they security point was Professional yet touch of human in them.  There is NO comparisons with Las Vegas Security people.
I believe Dallas Security people needs to learn Curtesy, a basic of Professionalism.",1
"#tsa at #dfw was particularly rude today. There was a 75 yr old gentleman in front of me going through security. Our stuff went through the scanner.  The guy running the scanner just kept cramming bags and trays through. Everything became so compressed that the gentleman's tray of stuff went flying everywhere.  TSA was oblivious or didn't care and just kept cramming things through.  I stepped over to try to hold back the tide while he picked up his loose items.  I found his ring in the rollers.  ""Y'all need to pick up your stuff and get dressed over on the side"".  Seriously?!  I'm envisioning my expensive laptop flying off the belt as they try and cram more bags through.   I found the gentleman's cell phone with my things.",1
"Need to understand between flight again control and remove shoes like old time, it's dirty down the floor! Nothing provided to cover your feet! Really bad",1
"Security staff should stop laughing at passengers belongings. If you want fun then this is not the right place for your job. People may travel from different places, regions, with different cultures and respective belongings. You don't have the rights to laugh at passengers. Do your job first without insulting passengers. We give respect but that is until you give respect to passengers. And when you are taking out stuff from passenger's boxes or bags for checking, it is your responsibility to keep everything securely in same box/bag with tape completely. But you people didn't  do like this. You are giving the wrong impression to passengers by doing like this. Give respect to elders too. Elders may not know English so support them for smoother security check process.",1
"I try not to give 1-star reviews to places, but I honestly have nothing good to say about this airport. The employees are unbelievably rude. Several things such as escalators, toilets, sinks and outlets all seem to be ‘out of order.’ Parts of the airport smell strongly of urine. We have had to wait hours to get a rental car. Every time I have come here, its been a very unpleasant experience. If I didn’t have family in the area, I would never fly into this sorry excuse of an airport.",1
TSA employees by C terminal have unprofessional/ rude attitude. TSA at ID scan verified Pre CK and told me procedures. Told TSA at scanner that I was Pre CK. Said he didn't care because wasn't Pre CK line (no other line close). After removing all the items. Another employee said they do Pre CK. So I didn't have to remove all my items afterall. Made me waste more time on an already short connection.,1
"Always delays every time I have to take a connecting flight to/from here. Even worse, some terminals have no seating or two rows at most. By far, I avoid this airport the most.",1
"Terminal C is old, dilapidated & should be demolished. TSA at C10 doesn’t have precheck. Closest is C21. .",1
"Hated almost everything about this airport. The layout is terrible: the bathrooms are far apart, there is no plan for people standing and waiting at gates so everyone ends up in the hallway, where people need to walk and the accessibility cars need to drive. There are always massive lines at any food place and then no place to sit. There is not enough seating at gates either. Everything is HOT, sweaty, loud, and chaotic. They changed our gate 4 times between when our international flight landed and our domestic flight took off. The last change went from the very end of the terminal to a completely different terminal with less than an hour before we were supposed to leave.",1
"By far the worst bathrooms in the United States of America. I went and used the stalls by A36 and every stall had human poop on every single seat, it was so gross. When people go to bathrooms they expect cleanliness. I even put two seat papers down and that didn’t even help. Poop was on everything. Please fix this!!",1
"My best friend had an overlay on her way back home, the plane she was on landed late (due to weather issues when here, there, and where she was going was completely clear). The manager she spoke to was completely rude but yet accommodated a family that were his same race. I am not the type of person that racially profiled anyone, or takes anything to heart like this, but that was something completely uncalled for. There are 7 other people that got left as well, and this isn’t the first time people have been left at this specific airport. Do better.",1
"After decades of air travel with the exact same travel kit, today TSA decided part of my med kit was a ""dangerous saw.""

These people are ridiculous; TSA is ridiculous; security theater is ridiculous.",1
"I missed my flight because I landed with a short window to catch my connection. I get to the departing terminal via Skylink & start looking for gate C31. There are Blue signs directing travellers to C28-C31 as soon as you get off the Skylink. I get to a sign that says  C25/C26/C31. I follow the directions and end up outside the terminal. This means I now have to clear TSA again to get back in. That wasn't enough time.

Apparently this sign means if you got off a flight at any of the mentioned gates, this is your exit.
That's not that apparent to a person desperately trying to make a connection. Passengers just want to see their gate number and that's enough to go in that direction.",1
Worse airport in history. Been sitting on the runway for hours with no information after 5 hour delay with every excuse why. Airportis clear to fly by ffa. Zero ability to talk to anyone. Keeping me on the plane so I can't drive to Austin. Dfw should be shut down every employee  can barely spell tsa!! Thanks for absolute nothing!!!,1
"Most horrible experience in my life, needed wheelchair assistance due to a bum knee, was left at C21 for 35 minutes while 4 wheelchair assistance people told me they would be back, NO ONE returned, absolutely NO ONE, at this time I am in tears, due to the fact my plane was boarding in 30minutes and I had no way to get too E26, I again went to customer service desk and a nice American Airlines rep pushed me to the train and then my gate....Just unbelievable experience, by the time I made it to my gate they had boarded, the nice woman who was pushing me had to talk to them and they let me board. I'm extremely upset with this experience at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport.",1
Coming in from Europe and going thru customs was a joke.  We all had to go thru security again just to connect with another flight.   What do they think we did while in the plane that needed another security check? The lines for 2nd or 3rd security check were 20-30 mins.  The line for TSA Pre-check was longer than the regular security line.  The employees were rude.  All the fancy stores don't make up for a good airport.,1
"A man who is an agent from the Dallas-Fort  airport customer service was stand up at the 2do level of the scalator which connects with Terminal D, I was looking for orientation how to get in the train that goes Terminal B, door B17,he was very rude. I just ask him what train should I get since it was my first time at this location, he actually yelled to me saying ""that left train is the one I've to get"". I told him I've not been here before but again what rude person to respond as one is began to him as a favor?. DF Airport must train and review what kind of people hire as staff to work at. This man is no proffessional. Passangers like me whom come from a long hour trip, what actually gets your body restless, don't deserve treatment like this, there is not right! so disappointed",1
"Terrible. Going thru security was the slowest process in 20+ years of traveling, especially the checkpoint at B29. Avoid at all costs, I'd try a different one if possible and make a longer trek to the gate after security. Only 1 security line open and would only open a second after someone complained about the suuupperrr long wait. And that with at least 6 agents standing around not doing anything at all times. It took 25 minutes when it should have taken 10 tops. They need to get it together.",1
"This is the worst airport in the united states. Everything is old and ugly, the staff is unfriendly, traffic patterns to get to and from terminals make no sense, and if you’re flying in,  Don’t expect to get your bags for between 30-60 minutes after you get to baggage claim.",1
"I fly a lot and this airport is positively absolutely the worst I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with . If they truly want to be part of everything is bigger in Texas , how about more seating for eating areas , more seating in gate areas , more water fountains, DFW you are far far below world class in travel...",1
"My family suffered and was treated unfairly.
First the flight was delayed for two hours and then arrives at the airport 9:21pm. It’s 12:05am and my wife and baby are not out yet from customs check. This customs check is terrible hurt and offend people from different cultures. I believe this is ridiculous and very bad services. They should have more workers who could help…..Not to consider my family been traveling long flights and it’s already  exhausting. Sadly, this airport does not care if have a baby or if your ill or even if you elderly with disabilities. I witnessed this and disappointed.",1
Dallas Airport implements hard socialist policy by discriminating against anyone that vapes or smokes. They do this by removing all areas to smoke because they have decided you know what's better for you than you do and since you won't freely choose to do what they wants there decided to take your choice away. Will not ever fly into Dallas again.,1
"This place is definitely paying people to give positive reviews. There’s NO way any frequent flyer -or any flyer, for that matter- can think positively of this place! It’s massive, and hard to navigate. I’ve never been to a clean bathroom in this place. The employees are slow, rude, and unhelpful; my worst experience was flying with my bf’s family recently. There were 6 of us, all of us had a carry on and of the 6 of us, 5 had a checked bag. I also want it noted that we packed these bags together so nobody had a suitcase to themselves. When the carry on my bf’s brothers gf was carrying was too large I told her I’d take it as my checked bag since I didn’t have one and the guy at the gate said no, we’d have to pay to check it since “he knew we were trying to cheat the system.” We explained that we were a group and these bags were all of ours and had mixed clothes he fought us for 30 mins. We didn’t have this issue at any of the 4 airports we went to, only here because they are GREEDY and will do anything to make an extra dollar off of you. He also refused to tag our carry ons afterward and we had to ask another employee to do it for us. I hate this place and wish I lived near any other international airport.",1
"International airport with flights 24 hours, but no open restaurants or bars from 10pm to 6am? Horrible place to have a nighttime layover",1
"I've loved this airport previously but arriving in from outside of the US is horrendous. Probably the worst airport experience I've had, including other countries. Sat on the tarmac after landing for 30 minutes. Signage is so terrible they rely on staff to route people but they direct people to contradictory places frustrating crowds as they go around in circles. No lane dividers or signage to keep global entry, us residents, and non US residents in separate lines creating massive 2-3 hour lines. If you make it through that and manage to then get your bags, you approach the connecting flights queue where agents direct some overflow traffic back out to the main entrance unbeknownst to the workers there who then yell at you for trying to enter the main airport entrance and make you return to the connecting flights queue. Another 30 minutes later and you then arrive at the dog pit where you have to pair up side by side with random passangers like you are walking down a wedding aisle, all the while drug dogs criss cross back and forth around you. (really here you might as well be swinging branch to branch above crocodiles.) Finally, you get directed by a tsa ticket officer to the final security line where, once you get all your things in the bin, the xray officer comes out, asks you what flight you came from, and then yells at you that somehow you are in the wrong xray line,which at this point everyone just ignores and makes him deal with it. Of course then you have try ride the sky link to your final terminal. I feel bad for those I left behind....",1
"Silly stuff goes on at DFW. Why is there a lady waving a wand telling you to keep going? I know I have to go and let people out I don’t need you telling me that And acting like I’m a nuisance . Also, keep in mind it takes more than one minute to get bags out the car and say goodbye fix the airport and you won’t have issues with parking or crowding",1
"Security was incredibly slow, and their airport needs a major update. Not enough chargers and it felt dirty. Haven’t been to the other Dallas area airport but if I have to come back I definitely will not be flying into DFW.",1
"I have no idea why this airport has such a high rating. THOUSANDS of peoples flights were cancelled not once, not twice but three to four times. The lines to receive hotel vouchers, and to talk about rescheduling were over three hours. They were not apologetic and could care less if you had hotel reservations in your destination, missed excursions and family members on other flights trying to make it there all over. After sharing our experience in social media, many people messaged saying they had the same experience always with this airport and to only fly out of Austin or Houston. Just don’t fly American Airlines and try to change your connecting flight to somewhere else.",1
Spirit Airlines scandal.. three flights fates are not decided and attendants has no solution from above and all passengers are furious asking what’s next.,1
nice airport don't get me wrong but so many flights are being canceled my flight got canceled at 12 am after making us wait inside the airport for almost 4 hours. I got moved to a new flight for today its already been delayed almost 3 hours and if this flight gets canceled again I'm not sure what I'm going to do I just  want to go home,1
Flight was late and instead of telling us they waited they left without us and gave $12.00 for food and nothing is even open. I will never be flying with American airlines again or using this airport no one could answer my questions. I had to yell to be heard.,1
If I could give it zero stars I would! But it wouldn’t let me! This was the absolute worst airport I have ever been to. Shame on you!,1
"DFW remains the worst airport in the United States to fly into. You can expect an hour long wait after you reach your baggage claim to get your bags at DFW.  If you ask questions about the ridiculous wait- you are treated with apathy, hostility, and a complete lack of help.  Everything else works fairly well, but this alone drags it down to the worst.",1
The worse airport in USA they gave so much power to tsa as they can remove stuff that is seal but they read it 1st to see if the agent like it they will keep it don’t risk it,1
This airport nickel and dime you for just picking someone up.  No parking.  They charge you for Just drove straight through for literally 3 minutes.  Never seen any airport like this. 🤦🏽,1
"Nice. But it's hard to pick anyone up from here. There is a TSA agent Jacob Who has a very bad attitude  and does not belong  working  with the public I also saw him being rude with a lady  who showed jacob  her digital  passport  on her cell he started  what who do u want me to talk to I need your passport.  TSA does not need to be rude  when working for the public  they  are public servants who do an important job, but remember, they are public  servants  June 1st 2023 at  5:10 pm",1
Flights are nonstop delayed. Hours and hours go by with nothing to be said about our flight other than it being pushed back. All of this is because of 1 inch of snow.,1
"International customs were completely rude and unprofessional.

My friend is visiting the U.S. for the first time all the way from Australia. She informed International customs she was visiting the U.S to visit me. Customs got angry at my friend and said ""that answer is not good enough"" and to ""come up with a better answer"". This situation put by my friend in tears. Rather than calming the situation, Customs got annoyed at my friend and insisted he provide ""a better answer"".

Unreal. I've always wanted to go to visit Texas, but if their International Customs reflects the rest of the airport and the state even in the slightest, I'm all set.",1
"People who work here are rude and won’t let you speak. They treat you like livestock. Avoid this airport if you can, fly out of love field, it’s much better.",1
"Most overcrowded inhospitable airport ever!! Never never easy to get through and the TSA are rude,  ill prepared for large numbers of passengers - they yell, shout and misdirect people. Always try to avoid this airport!!",1
"Every flight both directions late! Missed connection, then was told by rude gate attendant (A28) that needed to to Customer service (c25) to get new boarding pass when customer service told he could have done it.  Insensitivity from all flight crews was unacceptable.",1
"This place blooooows. 7 hour layover, landed at midnight and not leaving till 7 AM. Couldn’t find a single place in this entire ginormous airport to get a brew doggy. Plus the employees were moody.",1
"I flew from Seoul for an hour and a half before flying to Denver. My ticket was issued 16 hours before in Seoul. It didn't have the gate on it. That's ok. It probably wasn't known. My problem is with DFW: they did not post that flight to Denver on the Departure list screen. That's a big problem. Not posting that a flight exists causes a problem for the people who don't already know where– which gate– to go to.
March 2024: the departure screen lines swap between different flights to a specific destination.",1
"Take a bottle of vanilla we got from the Cancún duty free cause it didn’t have a “sticker”

Worst airport I ever been in

Do better",1
"The worst airport I have ever been in. The rental car are far away from the airport that you need their buses transfer you. They are full most time, so you wait for long time to get from the airport to the rental car. The rental car area are the worst. We waited for hours to get the car. The car was dirty and was quarter empty. It was worst experience. Our flight was late. They don't have comfortable seats who need sit for long time. The gate open to a bus. They take us to another area to go to our airplane. It is very unprofessional.
We waited in the airplane for an hour until they get us down because they did not have an open place for our plane.",1
"If i could give a zero rating, I would. People have places to be and it'd not fair to have flights delayed 8+ hours.. two hour flight. First, mechanical issue, second, people don't want to show up to work on time to board everyone. So, it gets delayed again. I would highly suggest getting a connecting flight elsewhere! Never again.",1
"The American Airlines gate agents are rude and unhelpful. The treat flyers with disrespect and do not care about whether or you make your flight, are comfortable, or feel helped. They do not care. Unbelievably incompetent service.",1
"If you’re going to continue to use the E satellite gates, fix your equipment!! I fly through here 1-2 times a week and have yet to see everything working at the same time!! I can easily walk it but watching multiple elderly and disabled passengers struggle without the aid of carts or wheelchairs is embarrassing and a huge disservice!",1
Dear DFW and CocaCola: having the only available bottled water cost a minimum of $3+ is a joke. There is only a small number of filtered water dispensers as well. Seriously disappointed,1
"I feel that this is a horrible and greedy airport. I was flying from one smaller US city to another smaller US city, and had a 8 hour connection time.

My flight to DFW was early in the morning. Due to waking up at 4am, I felt a little tired. In vain did I look for a place to relax (relaxer chairs to put your feet up or some other chairs where you can extend yourself).

I found the airport to be so greedy. They invested in chairs that prohibit you from lying down due to armrests.

People are camping on the dirty floors. Others try to lie down on the chairs with armrests, though it is not comfortable.

HORRIBLE. Very poor experience. I’ll avoid if an extended connection time.",1
"Very unorganized.  You will most likely be waiting several hours for one thing or another.  Last minute gate changes, lost your luggage, different every time but they are consistently bad.",1
imagine: you get off your flight to see an *entire* foyer at customs brimming with countless travelers all in one line is terribly understaffed and inefficient. an hour+ for anyone to get through (especially if they have connecting flights) is a joke.,1
"The airport strands thousands of people late at night with no type of accommodations like pillows or blankets.  Then, every single store, including a dump like 7-11 is closed. So not only are you stranded without any accommodations you can't even purchase anything. Hundreds were told to get into the service center line. 2 hours in line and they announced that the service center is closing with over a hundred people still waiting. We were told over the pa systems the service center will reopen at 3 to 4am. At 3am the line started back up only to be told the center doesn't even open until 6am. This place is a joke. Even the employee's have no clue whats going on or what hours of operation they have. Talking to people who fly in here regularly, they say this is a normal occurrence for this place. Do yourself a favor and don't fly out of or do a connecting flight here.",1
Boooooo! The airport itself is fine. Clean and pretty efficient. You have to pay to leave the airport on the road and everything is overpriced. Like way more expensive than it needs to be. It's extortion because it's not like you can bring your own drink to the gate. It's trash and very much taking advantage of travelers. Change your policies DFW.,1
"This airport shouldnt be rated with 5 stars, the employees that work here are VERY rude and mean. When me and my family got to the gate to scan our ticket to get in the plane the employees at the front put us aside and they let everyone go in that was standing in line.They ignored me while I was asking questions they gathered together as a group and totally ignored me until I started getting loud with them it seemed like they were being racist, we also heard them say ""Lets not let them go in"" after we had showed them our confirmation and seats from my phone. Ill never come here again to be treated this way.Dallas Fort Worth airport has bad customer service!!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",1
My parents don’t understand English. They need a wheelchair to help direct to the gate. Nobody helps them at all. They left my parents at the airport until they missed their flight. They just standing and smoking. Bad services ever.,1
"Great airport! All is well and pleasant with my experiences at this airport other than employee nayyar from american airlines.

I understand that boarding can be stressful for passengers and employees, but please train your employees to be direct and professional, not direct and rude No smiles, very short, no empathy, the ugliest tone. Why work in customer service?

Please give her a raise so she can be better with your guests",1
"I got  comment on internet about this problem right away.  During winter season , it would be nicer to make available warm water  for hand washing Purpose This is the first time in my life  Iam experiencing this problem. Someone who has joint issues would have to fly with pain after hand hygiene would be ridiculous",1
"Beware of the Fake Taxi on the Lower Level terminal E. These are not Cab drivers! They are scammers and the Airport has a blind eye to this! If you need a Taxi, go to the Taxi stand on Lower level.",1
"American Airlines did not want to check my ID when I picked up my firearm. They only wanted to see my bag tag which is unsafe. Do not fly through this airport if you value safety or security. Additionally, my bag was left on the carousel with my firearm in it where anyone could have taken it.",1
"Long, chaotic and unfriendly waiting lines for Passport controll. Even for connecting flights.
You have to plan wisely the time when connection flight at this airport. Loads of patience is needed.",1
"Worst bathrooms of any airport in the country. The ones at A12 have had broken doors for 3 yrs.  The rest aren't much better. I'm in the airport multiple times a week, and they're the worst!",1
They need to get their baggage claim system together. They had guys pulling off bags before they even made a full rotation and leaving the every where without any regard for organizing. One even slammed a bag on top of my foot - no apology- it was mayhem.,1
The worst experience ever! I will never fly to or through DFW again. And AA American Airlines or the absolute worst airline. Zero stars if I could.,1
"Our flight was delayed due to mechanical issues and I travelled with my service dog which made me miss my connecting flight. Well, I was stuck in the A terminal and needed to walk her but couldn’t because they had closed and locked the Pet Relief station, which was absolutely absurd. Also, I was frequently looking to see which gate I was flying out of because it was not on my ticket nor had it been posted yet. So, when 4:00am came, I was finally able to see the flight info and that’s when the Jamaican man, Patrick, on the ride along floor cleaner tried running my service dog over and yelling at me and threatening me. Needless to say, I’m a combat Veteran and again, he threatened to run over my dog again. This airport is so far outdated as well that it’s so difficult to find a good place to relax while having to wait until a few hours until my next gate opened. Absolutely worst airport I’ve ever been to. If I could give them a “no-star” rating, that would’ve been more suitable.",1
"The pitiful delays at TCA checkpoints are appalling. Do better, please. By the way, the gate times and whether they are open or not on the website...rarely accurate.",1
Missed my published connection due to over 30min wait in security line - if this airport is serious about being a hub it needs to resource security adequately as in my experience it's a joke,1
The restroom on baggage claim A28 was very dirty and the ceiling was leaking. It’s a dam shame! As big as Dallas is they can’t clean and repair? It’s horrible and a hazard for both staffs and visitors. Water on the floor with no one drying it! It’s sad!,1
"“Beep beep watch the cart” they yell as they are weaving in and out of the people in the terminal.
They expect you to jump out of the way with the threat of getting run over. I wonder how many injuries they have caused?
I twisted my ankle trying to get out of the way.
There has to be a better way!",1
TSA is the worst at Terminal E. Stood in line for 45 mins waiting for them to open. They all should be fired.,1
I needed a wheelchair and no body came with the wheelchair after 30 minutes. So I had to walk and hobble around on two broken feet while empty wheelchairs passed me and when I asked for help they told me they were all taken and I couldn't have one. So awesome!!,1
"The black women at the Terminal E American Airlines bag drop next to Frontier bag drop are extremely rude and treat you like they don't like you.

American Airlines - get your act together.",1
I will go out of my way not to fly thru DFW. Most gate staff for American Airlines were rude and highly unhelpful.,1
"American Staff are completely rude when asking for direction inside this screwed up airport and claim that’s not what they are here for. Even canceled my flight for the disagreement. I asked one employee how to get to a simple destination and got an eye roll and was told can I not see he was on the phone. (He had in AirPods) He proceeded to yell at me as I walked away and the manager defended him and said his employees aren’t here to give direction and that he was probably on break. Mind you I have a 5 month old and 3 year old with me. I was left stranded. I was told if I couldn’t handle this airport, maybe I should fine different means of transportation. American, if you have people in uniform not wanting to help, even taking a break, maybe they shouldn’t be standing in YOUR uniform to be approached.",1
"Wow. Security took 2 hours to get from our international flight to our connecting flight. Several people on our plane missed their connection even though we areived 15 minutes early. TSA here was the rudest bunch I've ever encountered.  To anyone whose first experience in the USA was this, I'm so sorry. Please don't judge us by this.",1
"My mom came back from a vacation in Portugal, and brought back a bottle of olive oil and they made her check her bag and charged her 75 bucks and then stole it!!!!!!!! THIEVES.   ONLY AUTOMATED NUMBERS ARE GIVEN TO HER AND NO ONES ANSWERING WATCH OUT BECAUSE SHE EVEN HAD LOCKS ON HER BAG WOW!!!!!",1
"More times than not I end up paying for my own hotel due to canceled flights. Try to get help, ya right just wait in the line of 1000 folks",1
Disgrace. Half the elevators and escalators are busted. So hard to find a place to change levels. This airport had seen it's better days. Broke down.,1
Black Male ..TSA Officer pushed me really hard while i was waiting to go thru security at work. I wish I would have reported it earlier but now saying something because people shouldn't have to get pushed at work!,1
"Why is this airport reviewed so well??? Construction is never ending, baggage can’t get priority off before anyone else, the shuttles are understaffed, overworked and often abused by the likes a Karen who has simply been waiting too long… boo hoo.  Chaos, or rather calypso rules over this airport.   American Airlines needs to get their staff under control.  The pilots want to come home early, inconviencing everyone on the ground.   The flight staff are angry, rude, bullies, that simply have a control complex.  Last two times I’ve flown felt like a hostage situation rather than something I purchased.  They made going home to bury my mother 10 X more painful.",1
WORST AIRPORT EVER. .This place is a joke with only ONE person at TSA for all the travelers.   Disgraceful for an international airport.  You should be ashamed of this,1
"We had arrived for our flight and forgot to check in which was my fault, but the lady who Was giving us service was so freaking rude!! I don’t think I’ve ever encountered someone so rude before, so just be aware they don’t care!",1
There is a reason this is one of the worst airports in the country. So happy  to have been stuck on a delay here on Thanksgiving. You literally and clearly do not care about any travelers. Suck a big d Big D!,1
Toilet overflowing and the staff that was standing in the bathroom just stood there while on his phone swiping away for the 5 min I was in there. Not did he only ignore the problem he was there to fix but I'm not sure the bathroom is the most appropriate place for a dude to be pointing his phone around,1
"Worst service for the disabled the workers have no care at all, they were very rude, I nearly passed out and they still didn't care, all my boarding passes clearly stated WHEELCHAIR REQUIRED and when I arrived non eas there and going to my connector flight either, I will try my best to NEVER have to go through this airport again.",1
"Took an hour for luggage to arrive.  The TSA lines were absurd too.

Updated, still slow and rental car situation is even worse",1
"Overcrowded and unenjoyable. Terminal A is not a good experience. Even the mens bathrooms have giant lines the whole time and everything is a giant walk.

Everything also shuts down around 8 even in the bigger terminals which is crazy for an airport.

It’s impressive that it can look so nice and new and still be so bad in function.",1
If I could give 0 stars I would. I lined up for general boarding for 35 plus minutes to catch my flight. I get called by the security check officer (I’m clearly in the general boarding line) and he scans my ID and ticket only to tell me I’m not pre-boarding check in and to go ALL the way to the back of the line. I then request to speak to the supervisor who also sends me to the back of the line claiming I cut the line when I never did. Poor management of staff is the blame here and he clearly made the mistake. There were no apologies or attempts to listen to me. There were no clear signs or indications that his check in spot was only pre check in. I’m absolutely appalled with the way I was dismissed and pushed to the back all due to an error on their end. I will try to avoid traveling through this airport at all costs. I was dismissed and embarrassed in front of so many people for a mistake that I didn’t make. Not to mention I almost missed my flight. Do better.,1
There is always delays in this airport especially if you are travelling to San Antonio. Several stores are closed either temporarily or permanently.,1
"🤮 this airport sucks! Don’t use this airport if you have any early/overnight international flights. We had a flight that left at 5am and the area where you checked your bags was closed until 3am and so was security. I’ve never been to an airport where those things were CLOSED. The customer service attendants were on their phones, and seemed put out by having to offer assistance. They shouldn’t offer flights that early if they can’t accommodate with sufficient time to get bags checked and through security. -10/10, I’ll be sure to pay extra to avoid this airport!",1
DFW needs to seriously update technology wise. Finding a plug/charging area is pretty difficult. Several plugs didn't even work making us sit gates away to find ones that did.,1
"Worst airport ever! Too huge to function. They closed the Skylink to my connecting flight with no reason or clear directions of what to do. Only option is to leave security, take a bus to the terminal and go back thru security. Missed my flight! How do you shutdown the only way to connect to terminals inside security with no other options. “Sorry for the inconvenience”. Incompetent!!!!",1
"I travel all over the country and Dallas Fort Worth (DFW) is the slowest baggage claim by a longsho and it’s been that way for years, doesn’t seem to be a desire to correct.",1
How many piles of VOMIT have been left to sit and rot up in this joint? Typical Republican establishment...Can't pay anyone a living wage to clean up after the messes you make.,1
This is quite honestly the worst airport I’ve ever been to. Every single connection I have had out of here has left me stranded.,1
"The trashiest airport I’ve ever flown in and out of!!! There was black mold on the ceiling panels at baggage claim, there was a huge roach that ran across the sinks in the bathroom, and a RAT on the bottom level ground transportation!!!",1
"On flight 2522 on 9/4 at 10:30, I observed extremely rude behavior between the stewardess and a customer who was at the wrong terminal. The customer was in a panic trying to figure out where to go, did not speak English, and the stewardess rushed the customer away. Simply told her, ""Go that way.""

Food and bathrooms are alright here, although you have to pretty much make travel arrangements within the airport to get there",1
TSA security line long. DFW people were bossy and rude,1
"My disabled father was not given the resources he needs at this airport, didn't give him a wheelchair he needed, or anything of that sort",1
"This airport is a living nightmare. It's the size of a small city, fast-paced, and chaotic. If you have never driven through here, good luck. It's impossible to know if you're going the right way or provide directions to pick someone up.",1
A woman that was working on September 19 2023 at gate D 36 with American Airlines I do not recall her name. She was very rude to me and my mom we had a horrible day that day because we had missed our previous flight by two minutes and they wouldn’t let us on the plane. We had missed our 4:00 am flight we made it on our 12:00 flight then we finally got to Dallas. We missed the flight from Dallas to Phoenix because they kept changing the gate so we got rebooked on standby for another flight we made it to d 36 and this woman called us up around 5 min after we arrived at the gate. We did not hear her say a word and we were right next to the desk and she yelled out our names and said “I CALLED YOU GUYS FOUR TIMES” so my mom calmly said “oh I’m sorry we didn’t hear” then she said are you guys willing to fly separately and we said no so she said ok sit down so we did then she yelled out our names again and she said “COME ON GUYS GET YOUR IDS OUT DO YOU WANT TO GET ON THE PLANE OR NOT” so we did and my mom gave her some sass back to her and she said here you go. She was nice to the pilots and flight attendants that were ahead of us but she made me and my mom cry because it was just adding more and more fuel to our bonfire of a day and I wanted to say to this woman you don’t know what someone is going though so you should be more courteous to people. Also it is very hard to navigate the Dallas airport so now you know which airport to not fly to.,1
Nobody don’t answer the phones during business hours been calling since yesterday for lost and found. Call other airports to see if maybe airports don’t answer phones and so far DFW just let the phone rings and send it to Automated voice services,1
Terrible airport someone a plane is always worked on maintenance this happened twice  in one week. Always being delayed never on time,1
"Words cannot express how much I dislike DFW airport. The C terminal is filthy and unmaintained, the escalators and elevators or broken or rickety. The restrooms smell like raw sewage. They change gates like they're changing music playlists. TSA agents act like they hate their job and take it out on passengers. PreCheck lines were closed at every security checkpoint. The agent got pissed that I only had my ID out and not my boarding pass. I have traveled through a dozen other airports this year and have only had to show ID, except for here.",1
"Stuck here overnight due to American Airlines canceling our flight because there were not enough passengers going to Europe.  The motel they provided was literally the most disgusting experience of my life.  Everything was dirty, there was trash left in the room.  The sheets had stains with crusty stuff (I don't want to think about what it was).  There was a used q-tip 🤮.  The room had no soap.  American Airlines gave us $12 for food for three meals.  We were supposed to be in Italy for our anniversary but obviously missed it.  American Airlines didn't show that they cared at all.  As a matter of fact, when the flight that was supposed to leave at 4:55 pm was canceled at 11 pm keeping us hostage on the plane they told us to exit and get hotel vouchers.  When we exited there were seven agents waiting.  We were the first off.  We stood there for at least five minutes as the rest of the passengers lined up behind us.  None of the agents would look at us or even acknowledge our existence.   Someone behind us finally asked are you going to help us and one agent said step forward.  My wife and I were originally separated and put in coach seating even though we had previously paid for the upgraded seats.  They told us we would get a reimbursement eventually.  Since it was late they gave us a taxi voucher to get to the hell hole of a Motel.  Of course, after waiting 40 minutes on a Sunday night at the taxi stand we found out there were no taxis.  We walked 4.4 miles to the Motel.  The following day we tried to use the voucher to get back to the Airport but the taxi drivers refused to accept the voucher because American Airlines takes several months to pay and they take a percentage of their own voucher off the top.  We paid $28 for the taxi and offered the voucher to the driver and he said throw it away.  It was not worth the paper it is written on.  We had to get covid tested 3 days in a row due to American Airlines delays and cancellations.  Each test was $79 or $80 depending on the Airport.  We had to pay for four test out of pocket.  We are still stuck in Dallas.  I called American Airlines complaint line and after waiting over four hours they said they don't accept complaints over the phone. We have to go to AA.com to file a complaint.  Yet we are still stuck here.  Not sure when this nightmare will end.  Thank you American Airlines for ruining our 25th anniversary.  Oh and by the way we missed our own family celebration, not that you care.",1
"While I can’t speak for the airport itself as much as the American Airlines staff, my experience was horrible. The flight attendants, gate attendant and desk associate at Rapid City airport in South Dakota all told us that we should contact customer service and they will take care of a hotel due to the fact it wasn’t weather or FTC related, they were unwilling to help and looked for every excuse in the book to blame it on someone else. I never fly with American and this is a prime example of why. Delta or Southwest would never of handled the situation in this manner. We are now stuck in DFW airport with no one from American Airlines willing to do or say much.",1
"How this airport has such great reviews is beyond me. My gate changed 5 times in 2 hours. Then, the flight was delayed because the previous flight took a long time to leave due to loading baggage on that previous plane. I heard many people complaining of their gats changing, people running all over the airport, planes circling because they have no gate to land, flights getting delayed because they decided to change aircraft’s last minute. It’s the most unorganized airport I’ve ever been in. Save yourself the hassle and fly out of Dallas - love.",1
Ridiculous how cold it was in there. We had a 10 hour layover and froze the whole time. No stores where open so we couldn't even warm up with cofee.,1
I’ve been here for 13 hours straight and have nothing redeeming to say about this place. Next flight is in 2 days so….,1
"DFW & American Airlines is incapable of managing the services you pay for.  DO NOT under any circumstances trust them with your loved ones. They just wheeled my 86 year old mom off one flight and left her to miss her connecting flight. REMEMBER, employees represent the character of their owners.  THESE PEOPLE DO NOT DESERVE YOUR MONEY.",1
"We just witnessed an older female passenger in obvious distress who ultimately fell right next to a baggage claim desk with two attendants and a security “guard” and no one offered to help her.  My husband and another gentleman passenger helped her off the ground and into a chair.  Another passenger brought her a bottle of water. When the other passenger asked if the ‘security’ person could get help or a wheel chair he said “I called 911 get off my back”

Terribly disappointed with the personnel.    Huge fail DFW.",1
Totally upset Uber q cuz back up traffic everyday and charge toll even double and no body care plz move this q outside to move this traffic frequently,1
Enjoy having your bags thrown by this guy when you fly in or out of DFW. He launches bags like he gets a bonus for furthest throw and hardest landing.,1
Security lines do not work. The E terminal routinely only has one TSA employee checking IDs with 3 lines feeding into him. Expect to wait 1-2 hours in the security line even when there is not a crowd.,1
"TSA staff is horrible and rude. Older African American lady with brown and black twists was rude to everyone that was in her line. If you’re having a bad day, don’t mess up someone else’s. And baggage drop off area is extremely disorganized. Please do better.",1
"You combine the level of inefficiency of this airport and American Airlines' style of ‘99% always delayed flights’ is atrocious. I have yet to have an American Airlines flight that's on time, especially when transiting from DFW.",1
NOT GOOD AT ALL THEY CAN'T FIND MY LUGGAGE THEY KEEP TELLING ME THEY DONT KNOW  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LUGGAGE AND THEY CANCELED THE FLYS TWICE ON ME .,1
"American airlines staff should really have higher EQ When it comes to being on their phones in social media while folks are stressed out about their travel arrangements. It's not ok for them to be disrespected but it's also not ok for them to disregard and disrespect the client. American airlines works hard to earn our business and while you browse social media and are rude and dismissive of my fellow passengers it makes me question if I in fact can trust you to keep up your end of the term sheet called safety, professionalism and otherwise you ruin the customer journey. Shameful behavior by the gate 34 crew on September 19th 2023.",1
Worst car rental location. Waited over 30mins in terminal E for the car rental shuttle.,1
Going through security the guy who takes the id and checks your board pass is a pompous jerk.then the kid with the black hair in his face is threatening people he will delay them if they do not follow his rules. Totally unnecessary attitude from both. If you don’t like your job then quit.Three people complained to me as they were putting their items on. So there is a problem.,1
"One of the worse airports in the country, and dare i say the world with how much i travel.

There is NO TSA PRECHECK LINE AT THE A8 SECURITY ENTRANCE. You have to wait with the regular line and you still have to take everything out of your bag. You can keep your shoes on and walk thru the metal detector but that’s the only thing. I spent all this money for precheck for what? So stupid. There’s even a priority boarding line here that looks like a pre check line but with giant signs that says it’s not the precheck line. Stupid.",1
"Let me be very clear: if you value your possessions and your time, DO NOT FLY TO DALLAS FORT WORTH. DO NOT BOOK WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES!! I originally was flying from RDU to MRY and had a connecting flight in dfw, but AMERICAN AIRLINES had different plans. My flight that was supposed to leave at 3pm changed to almost 9:30pm, causing me to miss my connecting flight (WHICH WAS ALSO DELAYED). This didn’t happen to just me, but HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE were stuck in dfw with nowhere to go. One American airline staff  was kind enough to help me get a hotel AFTER MULTIPLE OTHER STAFF MEMBERS ABSOLUTELY REFUSED TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY, so I guess consistent customer service doesn’t exist with this airline. EVERY AMERICAN AIRLINE WAS ARGUMENTATIVE, RUDE, AND VERY UNHELPFUL. I did not yell. I did not get mad. Not for any of it. I dealt with it and had patience, but I lost my mind when I find out that AMERICAN AIRLINES ALSO HELD MY BAG FOR NO REASON AFTER I arrive to San Jose. I also confirmed with the help desk BEFORE I EVEN LEFT DALLAS FORT WORTH TWICE to make sure my bags were together arriving at the same time. again, THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD ARRIVE AT THE SAME TIME BEFORE I EVEN LEFT DFW, but I guess the airline had different plans. This affected me greatly because I am here for business and my personal belongings that I need for work WERE WITHHELD FOR NO REASON. I spoke to the bag assistance employee, she tells me there’s no reason listed. I call the 1 800 number, they say the same thing. on top of it all, even the employee on the phone WAS ARGUING WITH ME AND TOLD ME TO “just buy everything again” LIKE AS IF THAT IS SOMETHING YOU SAY TO SOMEONE THAT HAD THERE BAGS WITHHELD FOR NO REASON.

Sorry for the long review, but this is by far the WORST airport in the United States and AMERICAN AIRLINES is by far THE WORST airline I’ve ever flown on. Not even spirit or frontier is this bad. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money to fly with a better airline or to not have a connecting flight in DFW.",1
"Always a bad experience, Always a delay !!! Sat on a plane for hour and half just for them to get off the plane and  have us waiting in a very long line to talk to customer service ! It's always a issue here!!!",1
"Nice airport but a lot of flights get delayed or cancelled. If you are thinking to have a stop here, DON'T!!! I've been stuck here 2 days. My flights keep getting cancelled. Nice wather by the way.",1
Flight leaving for Australia delayed 7 hours. Just returned & flight to Fort Myers delayed 9 hours....so far!! Never fly through Dallas!!!,1
"Worst airport I’ve ever visited.  1) longest walk I have ever had from my arrival gate to to the baggage claim.  I either had to go through security again to stay walking inside, I would walk outside then inside. I came in at about gate E2 and picked up baggage at E37.  2) There are so many people on the rental car bus, we had to break our group up because they don’t have just a pick up bus.  I guess we could have found out where the last drop off was and walk another mile to that location.  3) The rental car company couldn’t even explain where to return the car to and gps doesn’t know either, so just watch the signs which are confusing.  4) When you pick some at the airport the signage is awful and you have go what looks like parking spaces in a parking garage to get to the pickup area is, again gps is confused.  Also this airport charges for just driving onto the airport grounds and it’s a very long drive once you get on airport grounds.  5) Taking the bus back to the airport felt like trying to get out of Afghanistan.  There were way too many people for the amount of buses they had. People are pushing and shoving, going to late for their flight, and the whole system is a disastrous mess that middle school kids could do better at designing a proper system.  6)  I don’t care much about this one but it’s one of the ugliest airports in existence.  They don’t even try with a little art or aesthetics.
Someone needs to go back to the drawing board because this is really bad and I didn’t know until I spoke to others and they had the same opinion.",1
I love the airport but the GPS is just something else🤦🏻‍♀️it always takes me through restricted 🚫 areas🙄 whhhyyyyyyy!??,1
"GARBAGE! The  Functionality of this airport has went to complete trash. Used to have directions on how to get to your airline terminals not anymore what idiot thought that was a good idea? Also skyline train one side was closed so you have to take the long way around. It's shocking that the remodel has made the airport worst for customers.  I'm going back to Southwest.  Love field never has these issues,  and it's free! Do better DFW!",1
We got off our plane had one hour to get to our next flight. No one to help give directions and going through all the check points was crazy . This is a update.  Got to Knoxville went to get my luggage and guess what still in Dallas.  When i got it my lock was cute. I know they cut it off say something about it. I understand if something shows up you have to check it but really pay for my lock. We are not made out of money. Get better make more training people have to get to one plane to a other fast.  If Thailand can do it i think you can.,1
What is this airport? 9:30PM and I cannot find anything open to eat or drink something.,1
"Typical airport. Some terminals are nicer than others.

03/09/2023 What a disaster this place has become. In my opinion, it is worse than Charlotte. Flight delays like crazy. Cancelation on the regular. Every worker within the terminals act as if they hate life. I used to love flying through here, but now I try to avoid it if possible.",1
Horrible experience. My flights kept getting delayed and couldn’t offer me a hotel to sleep in. Then on top of that they misplaced my luggage. Chose another airline,1
"Where do I start!?! So much has happened that I can hardly keep track. I was supposed to be home by 6:00 PM today. It's now 11:04 PM and we're just now getting ready for takeoff...I think. 11;10 now and we're still parked on the runway. It's been one unbelievable delay after another, to the moment. We've just been informed about another delay that will hold up flight for who knows how much longer. This has been my worst flight experience ever on American Airlines.",1
"Atrocious airport for connecting flight, unaccommodating unfriendly staff, do not recommend",1
Worst travel experience of my life. I will never fly through dallas again.,1
"Wish I could give no stars.  I have lived in Texas my whole life.  I love and am proud of so many thing is this great state.  This airport is not one of them.  I am.not sure of the infrastructure challenges that made them design it this way, but man it is bad.  If you have a late arrival, good luck getting to your connecting flight on time.  I could go on indefinitely, but you get the point.  And don't get me started on American Airlines...",1
"I am here at Gate D24 DFW airport after getting the worse customer service delivered by American Airlines.

It all started when our first flight with this airline was delayed by 45 mins with no reason provided by the pilot (FLIGHT AA1348) who gave a spiel of welcome to DFW and the weather in Celsius. There was no advice nor concern for the already delayed passengers who are about to and who have already missed their flights to be the first ones to deplane. Now that we missed our connecting flight at 6:56 pm, we were told by an AA attendant to go to D24 to be assisted.

On D24, this AA lady attendant did not bother introducing her name but rather just asked for our boarding passes. All I told her was to see if she could get me the earliest arrival at our destination. No apologies, no empathy, and totally no care at all with the inconvenience that is ongoing, she proceeded with options that would give me an ETA of the following evening.

Already irritated with the delays, including forfeiting a night stay at our destination, I asked if AA can pay for a night stay. Instead, she said no and that AA does not provide any credits that the 'air controller,' 'it's the government not us,' has caused, and if I want I can cancel my whole roundtrip ticket purchase and get a 'partial' refund. Since I and my partner already took the flight going up here to DFW. Now this took my blood pressure to another level.

I told her that when I had experienced this missed flight with another airline because of weather delays (such as United and Delta), they provided our commute and night stay in a nearby decent hotel. She said AA does not do that. If a flight is missed due to air traffic control or weather, American Airlines does not provide any accommodations.

During this process, I asked for a couple of minutes to think and weigh whether I will just cancel my entire trip (booked three different hotels, booked a rental car, booked other stuff) since this is just a short weekend trip (Wednesday to Sunday). The lady was quick to wave her hand and told us to stand on the side while we decide. I am already boiling at this point and told this lady that I am already deeply inconvenienced and I just need a couple of minutes to weigh my options. I took a few deep breaths to let this anger pass as it seems like this robotic cold-blooded American Airlines staff does know how to bounce back every question I make about the airline's lack of courtesy in every which way except for its fault.

In the end, she printed the new boarding passes and handed us a little paper stating that we can get discounts on hotel stays 'Anything else I can help you with?' I answered no, and in my head, all I can think of is how this staff and American Airlines itself are so inconsiderate of their passengers.",1
Only one TSA Pecheck in C?  The TSA line was longer than the regular line. Hotel van dropped me off at C6 then I had to walk to C31 for TSA PreCheck then back to C6 for the gate.,1
"Flying almost anywhere can be stressful, but one TSA man of Asian decent (did not get his name) in the security checkpoint for bag checking was treating two gentlemen like literal animals at around 7pm. At the beginning of the bag check, one of their barriers were open, and yes, the two gentlemen were in the wrong by going the wrong way, however, the way the TSA person handled the matter with such ferocity for a simple mistake that was, for lack of a better word, crazy. Yelling to the top of his lungs, “WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? GET BACK! GET BACK! GET BACK!” At first I wasn’t sure what was going on, because it sounded like something horrible was happening due to the intensity of this man’s tone, but come to find out, it was two men who simply went the wrong direction because the barrier was not properly placed. We are human beings, not animals. There’s a way to enforce the rules, which should always be the case, without berating someone over a simple mistake, which again, could have been prevented if the barrier was in the right position. The other TSA people were firm and helpful, it was just the one man.",1
"This airport is one of the worst when it comes down to signs, organization, and staff. Arrived at 1 hr and 15 mins early at 3:45am for a 5 am flight and they have 1 gate open with a 42 minute wait for security check. They didn’t call out anyone that had an earlier flight to be prioritized. You can’t use clear to skip line because it’s not available this early in the morning and you can’t check your bags because the the staff is limited at American Airlines terminal this early and the staff could care less about what accommodations you have. So after you watch 1 person be processed every 15 mins at checkin with a staff of 4 people you have to sit back and laugh at the process and remind yourself just don’t fly out of DFW airport save yourself the headaches or be prepared to arrive 2-3 hours early and waste your time because of the process.",1
"This airport is absolutely ridiculous. Fly out of DAL if you can. I arrived 2 hours prior to my flight. When I get to the Delta kiosks only one was working. To make matters worse, there were no employees to check bags at the counter for over 40 minutes. The TSA line was nearly a mile long. I still  missed my flight after arriving well before takeoff. This airport does not respect the time of its passengers. If you fly out of here expect it to be a hassle.",1
We spent a freezing night in DFW waiting for a connection. Temperature in the 50’s. They should be distributing parkas to all travelers. Inexcusable.,1
"Worst Experience  And customer Service ever , Especially flying American Airlines. the Women at the Check in Desk for Our Flight to Ontario, California basically Said “F You” to all of us at the Gate when the Gate shut because we were “late” Do better and treat flyers with Respect.",1
"Had a one hour layover. Here I am 5 hours later, along with thousands of other people because they had a rainstorm around 9 hours ago. And apparently they don't have any air conditioning in this forsaken airport either because it is 94 degrees in the terminal. Avoid this place at all costs",1
Worse airport ever... You kniw your too bug when  airplanes sit on ramps for 25 min and then fates change 3x without any notifications,1
"Second half of D terminal had zero food options available after 10pm. Not even a self-serve kiosk. Auntie Anne's was the only place open and they ran out of food and only served drinks.
We had less than a 10 minute layover and no food options after a 3.5 hour flight before getting on a 4 hour flight. Absolutely unacceptable",1
Garbage airport.  Confusing.  Employees might as well be brain dead. Get here HOURS before your flight,1
Custom lines were so long. I had 1 1/2 hours before my connection flight and barely made it.,1
"The people were rude who worked there and there was some kind of conspiracy that they only sold coke products. Even 7/11 didn't sell Pepsi.

I'll try to avoid this airport every time that I travel.",1
If you wish to have the same experience like the boyscouts the TSA agent will gladly fondole you and treat you like a criminal.,1
Horrible..was changed gates 9 times!! Customer service disrespectful!! Will never come to Dallas Airport again!!,1
"This place is awful. Older blonde TSA lady was rude, pushy and unprofessional. Our gate was changed 4 times and staff admitted to not knowing what was going on with multiple different flights. After traveling for 25 hours I would have expected some amount of professionalism and order to the way this airport should be run.",1
"One of the most difficult airports to navigate. Signage is poor. If you rent a car and your destination is on the other side of the airport and you're using Google maps to find your way, the navigator takes you on the most direct route to your destination, which is back through the airport. This is very confusing because you feel like you somehow ended up in the wrong place. Since many airports are one way in and one way out, I wasted 20 mins figuring out that the road I had been on, ""International Parkway"", passes through to the side of the airport and keeps going. Over that road all you see is signs for airport terminals, parking etc. A sign that says ""International Parkway"" with an arrow indicating you keep going would have been immensely helpful. Also, on the route provided by Google Maps, you have to pass through a toll booth entering the airport and then another when exiting the airport. $6 to travel through the airport. The toll attendant said it was so costly to discourage people from driving through the airport. But, if you're from out of town and relying on Google maps to find your way around, it's pretty hard to avoid going through the airport when your driving and depending on listening to the navigation because you can't look at your phone. The Toll Commission has quite a racket going. I guess Dallas is northern Texas, so Southern Hospitality doesn't apply.",1
"Wish I could give ZERO stars! Disabled, international traveler, must have wheelchair assistance. I speak English and Spanish. None of the wheelchair jockeys could speak either! Mine finally said I'm from Yemen. I speak Arabic. Which is fine but should not they have a requirement for some English. They run you through the airport like you're a piece of meat they have to get to the cooler. I ( and several others) had a two hour layover. They parked us at our gate and never came back to help us board. I had to ""hobble"" in a leg brace with a cane down a loooong gangplank to board. Now I know why people leave Texas to ree tire in Mexico😠😠😠",1
"Busy airport. Pretty typical.
Be sure to hang on tight when the trams between terminals take off. I waited for 2 wheel chairs to get on and by the time I got on and reached up for the grab bar, the tram launched, yes took off! I went flying backwards and landed on the back wheels of the 2 wheel chairs, one with big knobby tires! My arm, ribs and leg were sore for my entire weeks vacation in CA.  Is there really a need for these trams to take off at these astronomical speeds?",1
"Terminal E.. Horrible evening experience

All restaurants close at 9 pm, ticket counter for airline on the opposite end of terminal from plane,  only 1 TSA checkpoint for the entire terminal.   Frontier Airlines is a joke!  No professionalism.

Rediculous!!!",1
Horrible airport for the elderly. They changed the gate and had no wheelchair service for my mother from one terminal to the other.,1
"I drove 5 hours (round trip) to drop my family off for a flight just for it to get canceled due to a ""bird"" hitting the nose of the plane even tho there was smoke coming from one of the engines! So I drove another 5 hour (round trip) because they ran all the passengers on that flight in circles and didn't give them any compensation just a refund for the flight! 100% do NOT recommend!!!!",1
"Terminal C is super confusing and SUPER dangerous. Our American Airlines flight was delayed and we had to get a hotel for the night. American Airlines Customer service said to go wait at the curtesy shuttle for the La Quinta hotel.  The are we along with a few other people were directed to go was DARK and when I mean dark, I mean DARK. No security, no airport personal, lights were out and the phone didn't work, Dangerous conditions. DFW needs to fix this before someone gets hurt or worse.",1
"We had over 2 hours to get a connecting flight. Had to go through customs even though not staying in America, just catching a connecting flight was the only reason. Missed our flight to London and had to wait another 6 hours. Customs waiting time is OUTRAGEOUS. Literally 1000s of people queuing and waiting, we met 100s who missed connecting flights. Zero stars",1
If I could give them a 0 I absolutely would. Costumer service is at best nonexistant.,1
"Elevators in A terminal have been OUT OF SERVICE FOR 3 WEEKS! And there are no escalators. What is wrong with these people? What do folks with luggage do to get to rental car shuttle, remote parking shuttle, Taxis, etc? Abismal they don't repair them.",1
Worst airport of all times and I've flown out of their world countries...the whole place smells like urine and the staff and TSA were all completely rude and flat out lied to us multiple times...I will never book a flight out of the airport again...save yourself the trouble and don't even book connecting flights out of here. It will ruin your day for sure.,1
Sitting on a plane waiting to go to gate. Can’t because there is no ground crew.  25 minutes and you can’t get people to do their job?  I have a life to get to and you take your time as if we want to actually be here. We pay money for you to do your job.  So train your people and be organized!!!!!,1
"How to run an Airport into the ground:

1)  Make sure that the most poorly run, bankrupt city in Texas has majority voting on the board of directors (Dallas).
2)  Outsource your cleaning to ABM to guarantee that everything you touch is filthy and disgusting.
3)  Outsource your hiring to the Ethiopian Mafia.
4)  Make sure that at least 50% of the escalators, walkways, and elevators are broken, blocked off, and/or under repair.
5)  Crowd your terminal with golf carts and people haulers driven by the visually impaired.
6)  Ensure that there are no pet relief areas.
7)  Locate your rental car center 5 miles from the terminals and make sure the only way to get there is on a bus.  Then make sure that the buses run at irregular schedules so that 3 buses come back to back...then no one comes for 45 minutes.
8)  Update terminals that no one goes to, but leave the busiest terminals in their vintage 1978 appearance.",1
Terrible American Airline. 4 hours layover and 7hr delay!,1
DFW  is a third world  airport.  Escalators and moving walks are out of order.  Restrooms are dirty and out of supplies. Airport personnel are rude and are not  able/willing to give basic assistance,1
"Boarded the plane, already delayed by 50 minutes, and waited another 45 for a pilot who we were told was on the way. The American Airlines pilot never arrived and we were told to exit the plane and go to American Airlines customer service to rebook our flight for the next day. Lines were long, communication was poor, no hotel rooms were available, no vouchers were offered, and we had to spend the night in the airport, concourse A, which was dirty and unkept.  I don’t recommend the DFW airport or American Airlines - choose otherwise and enjoy your travels!",1
"This airport is disgusting, and out of date. The smell is overwhelming and the facilities are unsanitary. The security is horrible with outdated equipment, and under qualified employees. Oh, and don’t bother with TSA pre check because it’s useless here. I wouldn’t fly through this airport again even if it was free.",1
"I normally try to balance a bad review with some good news, but this has been the worst airport experience of my life.  I have been here for 24 hours, slept on the floor, had my American Airlines flight delayed four times, cancelled, and rescheduled. I am currently at SEVEN gate changes, and I'm holding my breath for the next one-still plenty of time to move us once again. I will say this-the people behind the counter are not the ones doing this, and they are as baffled and frustrated as we are... The only perk for them is that they can go home, something I've been trying to do for entirely too long.  Read this post AA.  Read this post DFW and try to do better for your staff behind the counter, and for those of us curled up on the floor of your airport overnight.",1
Flew in on American Airlines … worst mistake ever . Rudeness doesn’t even explain it ! It’s the lack of checking for passports on a international flight for me. It’s the delays on every flight we took . It’s the employees on tik tok in the terminal at the computers. It’s getting us there passed curfew and making us wait 10 more minutes. The fact that the pilot asked the lady checking him in your not gunna check my passport I just came in from Mexico and they checked me twice 🫵 just scan your badge giggle. I thought national security was a thing.  Hey but thanks for not even looking me in the face as you grabbed my boarding pass. Scanned and not once looked at my passport nice. #markedunsafeflyingamericanairlines,1
"Thankfully we arrived 3 hours early for our flight. We waited at least an hour in a very long and slow security line. People were cutting in line because they were about to miss their flight. There were only 2 security people and 2 lines for your carry on to be checked. They had room for 4 security people and 3 lines. They are way understaffed for the job. People were paying for a clear program to get through faster but that just held up the line, plus they had TSA pre checks to get through the line. If you are going to account for those 2 programs you need more staff. I have waited at other airports but this was a mess. I hope this helps someone so they can make their flight on time. Davina Youngberg",1
"Awful line at TSA precheck. Just because they favor ""Clear"" scam company!

After security, it wasn't any better. Narrow corridors, lack of seating, no kid zone. And, to add to the mix, food options are limited and too far from the gates...

Lastly, be prepared to wait a looong time for your bags...",1
"This is not a review against the airport but the frontier airline. They deserve zero stars for what they have done. In the beginning our flight was delayed several times. It was delayed in total five hours and 4 minutes. It was originally 9:18pm and was delayed till 2:22am. Then, when we went up there and no one was there at the help desk or at tsa to let us through and unlock the doors. When we questioned a baggage person we were told that there was no one there. After, we started chatting with the frontier customer service chat and they were unable to understand our questions and inquiries. Next, the dfw service on the phone at the airport. The dfw service on the phone also told us that the frontier airlines does this all the time and the frontier airline did not let the dfw airport know that they would have a late departure, so no one was there to receive us. Then, we attempted to do the frontier customer service chat again and there response did was a basic prompt that did not consider the question in any way and continued to confuse our questions. At that point we realized there was nothing to do at that moment and went home, in the morning we tried again and looked up numbers to call. We talked to Aeromar airlines and at first we were hung up on. The second time we called they told us it said we were a no show in the system and there was nothing they could do, and continued to say all they could do is get another plane ticket for us. We ended up getting a ticket with American airlines after declining aeromars offer to help book us another ticket for a regular fee and looked online for another flight that ended up being with American airlines. After this whole ordeal and no compensation or refund we have decided to never fly with the frontier airline. This is here to share our experience, explain what we have gone through, and worn others of what could happen and what has happened to multiple people. We are not the only ones, several other people were camping out because they could not get through.",1
"The layout of this Airport is absolutely bonkers. Connecting flights are scheduled across the complex with 25+ minute travel time between them with a layover time barely long enough to sprint from your arrival terminal to your departure terminal. God forbid your crew is late and your initial flight delayed, you’ll definitely lose that seat that you planned and paid a month in advance to get.

Everyone is running everywhere all the time. This isn’t the only airport I’ve ever had issues with, but it is issue after issue every time I’m forced to land here. This is a problem. Avoid DFW if you value your time and money.",1
"Very frequent flyer here, ATC here is an absolute JOKE.

UPDATE: The tower still sucks and they still don't know how to efficiently control traffic.",1
"I was sitting watching the planes and in a few hours I saw how 2 times the workers, who carry the luggages to the airplanes, from his car lost a few, the worst part is he didn't notice. Now I understand why my luggage can not endurance to much flights anf why some get lost.",1
"Horrible costumer service. I went to the culture map store inside the airport to use the money my airline gave me because I missed my plane but the cashier ( Aselefech zelibanos) was very rude and refused to help me. At the end she did not only refused to help me but refused to sell anything to me as well.

I am really disappointed and I'll never buy in that store again. If you want good costumer service I would not recommended it.",1
"Ever wondered what it would feel like to be locked and stranded inside a mall overnight? Visit DFW International Airport and you'll feel exactly that. Your flight is almost guaranteed to be delayed. Hopefully it's not after 9 pm otherwise you'll be stranded with 100s of people watching every service building closing in your face. Thos leaves you stabding in a like 40 deep, jist to pay $20 for a soda and a bag of chips. Half the vending machines are broke. Water fountains don't work. Most of the charging stations are ""out of service"".  Like...where all that money go?! Average pay for an airport employee at dfw is $15. Not even a livable wage. 🙄 The audacity.",1
"The worst airport I have been too. The customs area for US citizen is like a circus. No one seems to take charge and organize. The wheelchair assistance in that airport was a joke. I landed early for my connection flight but thanks to the wheelchair assistance person, who stated he Did not want to work international flights with customers in need of wheelchair. I missed the flight and he misplaced my bag. That should of been my red flag! It was the worst experience. Unfortunately, American airlines does not care because the wheelchair assistance is provided by airport. Like I said a circus🤦‍♀️",1
"In theory, the Amtrak is a great idea; however, its the most confusing system for anyone with  anxiety. Flying always gives me a panic attack but today all my biggest flying fears surfaced. I will avoid Dallas airport at all cost. I have displaced anger. I don't know if I should be mad at American Airline for booking the connecting flights so close that they overlap each other; or this dysfunctional unorganized airport. I waited in line for 5 hours, only for the counter to close at midnight, leaving 400 plus people to sleep on the hard nasty floor; no one offered any type of relief/solutions/updates. They treated the passengers like discarded cattle. By far my worst flight experience EVER, on dwn to the overpriced $8 turkey and cheese sandwich.",1
"Avoid this airport at  all costs. Traveling with a group, we had one student who is a non-citizen. They had 20 open lanes for US-citizens returning from abroad and only 4 open for foreign nationals. Because of this, we missed our connecting flight (two of us leaders stayed back with the foreign national student who couldn’t clear customs in time) After that it was a lot of gas-lighting, a lot of condescending people acting like it was our fault we missed our flight. I lost an item at a security checkpoint, but because I couldn’t remember exactly which checkpoint I went through (it’s a huge airport and we were already stressed/rushed) they rudely told me there was literally ‘nothing’ they could do. I had to physically go through all the security check points to locate my bag. Was told by a security person I had to ‘help myself’ and they couldn’t take two seconds to call other security/central security to check. But they have time to announce Jesus time (chapel service) 50 times a day. Honestly, every non-US citizen on our flight who had to go through customs missed a connecting flight. Seems like a racist, intentional system to punish foreign nationals flying into the US. Welcome to Texas I guess 😡",1
Worst security staff hands down. Terrible people that hate not only their jobs but also life in general.,1
"Bottom line: do not rent a car when coming to this airport, my flight landed an hour and a half ago and I'm still here.

Four employee shuttles have come and gone while a crowd of people stands helplessly for over a half hour so far, waiting to reach the rental car area by shuttle. Children's hopes rise and turn to disappointment until frustration gives way to escalating cries. We're left only to guess about the airport's priorities. You might pass through but I wouldn't recommend picking up a car in the process. Were I a car rental company, I'd certainly not suffer the embarrassment of having a presence here.",1
"Absolutely mind-blowing the amount of decent reviews this airport gets. These people must not fly much :/ This airport is horrendously filthy. Flights get delayed like crazy here as well. This is the only airport I've ever seen where you have to pay a litteral road toll to pick someone up or drop them off... 🤔 wild people think so highly of this hot garbage airport. Travel more, and you'll agree, i promise.",1
"Sucks to fly through if you are transporting dogs or cats. Not only was the plane 6ish hours late (aren't they always) but taking my kitten to the Dallas bathroon was a horrible experience. They have a small turf grass section the size of a small bathroom covered in pee, with poor drainage. The whole room smells terrible and flies swarm the walls. On the concrete leading up to the turf grass corner, the floor is splashed with pee puddles and its all over the walls. Definitely recomend other airports for your animal transportation needs if you have the chance.",1
There's not TSA precheck line in terminal C.,1
"Overcrowded, dirty, and unreliable. Staff is also rather rude, probably due to overwork and underpay. Don't fly through here unless you enjoy expensive food, dirty bathrooms, and being awake 24 consecutive hours after several delays with no help from customer support.

There are also no places to sleep even if you have the necessaries, unless you relish the thought of a $50 an hour bed. All of the seating has been made with immovable arm rests in order to ensure no one can sleep at the gate they've been detained in.",1
I work as uber driver. The traffic stuck in the queue. That cause the trip cancellation. And also increase the wait time which cause the high toll prices. Uber lot should move back to outside where it used to be.,1
This airport is the worst. Always a hassle. Usually half the escalators are out of services and the shuttle has limited seating and is hazardous for folks with mobility issues.,1
"I want to be really clear, the TSA agents checking IDs were excellent; however, the agents at the body scanner and downstream were the worst I've ever encountered. Very unprofessional, the Asian-American twenty something woman who dropped the f word every other word in front of children was a real class act. Just very unpleasant people all around with no patience. A little scary that these are the people protecting our airports. The rest of the airport was terrific.",1
"Open more security checkpoints after cowboys games, doesn’t take more than 2 brain cells to figure that out",1
"TSA was the absolute worse! We came from Cancun Mexico, purchased alcohol from the airport in Mexico and was told we could take the alcohol on the plane na shave no problems. We went through customs and they had no problems! TSA said because it was not in a sealed bag we could not take it in the plane. Now please understand if you have never gone through Dallas/ Fort Worth, they make you go through customs, grab your luggage you checked, drop it off at another station to have checked again and then go back through TSA (even though you never actually leave the airport) but because the bottle was not in the sealed bag they require (again purchased at an airport after going through TSA in Mexico) they would not allow me to bring it. They told another couple they could not bring theirs because the bottle was too dark to pass through the scanner! That was purchased alcohol I had to throw away! The TSA officer was completely disrespectful and down right rude! Actually said she was going to and I quote “enjoy your tequila you can’t take with you!” Unacceptable and down right disrespectful! If you can’t bring it from one airport to another then they all need to be on the same page with that! Also when my luggage was picked up it was ripped and completely ruined! I will never fly through Dallas again! I will pay more money to fly from another airport before I fly through Dallas ever again! The bathrooms are disgusting and dirty, the airport is dirty and all the employees are down right rude and disrespectful. I wish I could rate them a zero!",1
"Pet relief area is disgusting. My dog refused to enter. There is urine all over the floor, I stepped in 2 different puddles just trying to go in. Flys everywhere. It should be illegal to keep it in such condition. My dog was unable to relieve himself, and now has other dogs urine on his paws. Will never fly through here again. If you have a service animal I strongly suggest you fly through a different airport. Also no soap in all 4 soap containers of the ladies bathroom. Really gross airport.",1
"Wanted to share how disappointed I am that no restaurants or food courts are open past 9:30/10 pm. I was turned away from multiple businesses at 9:45 pm and I think that’s insane considering 10 isn’t even late and you have people who have been flying all day, sometimes international and they’re starving! Please do better!! Also, TSA was so rude and it’s just not necessary!",1
The terminals are very old and need updating it's very crowded As they were not designed for current operations. The only terminal that is large enough and has access is terminal d. Doesn't matter what term are you going to when you wash your hands? You get this hard. Smell? That. Is not good. I travel a 144 days a year without a doubt DFW is near bottom of list.,1
"This is an AWFUL airport: not only does its size make it difficult to navigate, but both employees and signage communicate policies and other information very poorly (sometimes offering conflicting accounts of things)—making for a more chaotic experience than is necessary. If I could give DFW zero stars, I would!

This last time, were told certain things were allowed onboard in carry-on and then were informed they had to be checked luggage—after we had already gone through security. So, we had to surrender those items, because with our flight time (and the snail’s pace of the various checkpoints) we wouldn’t have had time to go back to check baggage.",1
"Terrible for connecting flights, nearly missed my connection both times being in this airport. Badly organised",1
"Broken baggage claim carousels that are still being used, horrible rental car system",1
"Went to this airport for a connecting flight from Mexico to Canada. This airport was crazy packed. No one explained anything. All the staff were constantly yelling at you, telling you to walk at a quicker pace (not considering injuries or disabilities). The energy was terrible. Then, when I got to my American Airlines flight - they forced me to check my carry on bag - even though the flight was half full. I was anxious and crying because all my gifts and medications were in there and they wouldn’t even let me open it. I don’t think they liked how much I was BEGGING them to let me have my bag, so the woman at AA purposely left my bag behind. Will never stopover at this airport ever again.",1
"Terrible.  I barely made my plane & my associate didn't.  The TSA line (at gate B10) was so long, I had to walk 20 gates away (gate 30) to go thru a ""faster"" 30 minute line; only to have to RUN back 20 gates to by flight.  Ridiculous.

If you had the newer scanning technology, it would have been much faster:  but you don't.

The 'good news' is... I need a taste of DFW Airport every now & then to remind me why I fly SWA out of Love.",1
Terminal C is dumpster and TSA folks are a piece of work. If someone talked to my child like that out in public I'd pop them in the mouth. Go back to your hood.,1
"Prospect- the wheelchair company who serves the airport left my wife & I stranded with the wheelchairs & every employee we asked for help DID NOT help. I would suggest if you have wheelchair assistance, NOT to layover at this airport.",1
"Literally one of the worst airports I’ve ever flown out of. Homeless, irate people yelling and screaming down the halls, unprofessional and inconsiderate staff and odd opening & closing hours of tsa. I will be avoiding flying out of this airport by any means necessary.",1
"I don't travel often and with my child less. I also know that you are not responsible for TSA agents but their professionalism does reflect on your airport. Lack of instruction and differing processes between airports make it hard for youngsters to keep track of what is expected. Then to have an agent use the opportunity to vent his frustrations on the youngster is just in bad taste. It was a chance to teach, mentor, and provide a good experience for that person, and was an opportunity missed. They need to do better.",1
Delayed 4 hrs switched gates 6 times great job American airlines,1
"If you are handicap it is the worst. I WAS ON OXYGEN AND HAD TO HAVE A WHEEL CHAIR FLYING FROM LITTLE ROCK AR. TO Yuma Arizona.  When we were going they had
a wheel chair waiting the guy took me to the next flight made me get out of wheel chair .he needed for someone else . He was so ruff and rude I ended up with a brused back from him being so ruff .and on the way back to little Rock landing in Dallas  our plane was starting to board for our next flight  finally got wheel chair  and the guy was so rude to me and my daughter he left us sitting and took off and got some one else that had a 2 hour delay I was trying to get someone to help me to get to my next flight the guy told me if I didn't go was going to miss my flight. After I finally got on elevator.  There was a nice lady help me to my plane she had to run with me to get me there. I was never so humiliated in my life.  And I'm still having problems with  my back .",1
"I had a connecting flight from Durango mex to Denver, had a layover in Texas,  the customs people are rude!!! I understand they have alot of people traveling from all over the world but they need to be patient and more understanding, this guy' was raising his voice at me.... It's a big airport and I didn't know where to go .... worst service ever!!!!",1
"DFW is absolutely the WORST airport in the world!!!

The rudest customs agent yelled at everyone like a drill sergeant throwing his authoritarian weight around.

A crew member threw our luggage up into the air before it roughly landed on the luggage carousel. Then the crew member had the audacity to deny that he threw our luggage the way he did when we saw him do it and then called him out on it.

Workers at “restaurants” (I use this term loosely) were yelling at customers. Not to mention, DFW had terrible and unhealthy food options.

I will be happy if I never have to fly through DFW ever again, and I will recommend that my family and friends never fly through there, if they can avoid it.",1
Terminal link is poorly managed especially if you get to the airport at night.  You have to walk outside to an area that is somewhat secluded from public areas and if you’re alone it’s a little scary and confusing.  The website says it closes at midnight.  It’s 12:24 am now.  I had to call the airport for help and they can send the terminal link.  Why is it set up that way?  Please revamp this system.  People should be able to access a terminal link from inside and it should be easy.  The QR codes on the terminal link signs also don’t work. I have been standing here outside in the cold for over ten minutes.,1
"The worst place ever for wheelchair service, DFW should look for another company to offer this service. Wheelchairs are not longer available, I remember the days where you arrived to the airport and wheelchairs were available for everybody, now you have to request the service and they take up to 30 min. and they are not polite at all. They drop you off and leave. If you need to go to the bathroom or from the bag claim station to the exit, you have to figure out yourself. They must learn from California, New York, etc.",1
Everything about this airport is trash. Why is my planes always delayed once we get to Dallas…. I just sat on my spirit flight for an hour and 10 minutes AFTER landing because there was a plane having mechanical issues stuck at our gate…. It literally took them an hour and 10 minutes to figure out a new gate for us?!?,1
"As usual, they were not at the jet bridge with a wheelchair as requested.  The lady at the desk where we got off the plane was leaving for break and didn't have time to call for a wheelchair. She told us to go talk to another agent.  We were supposed to have an hour and a half between flights.  We were going to use that time to get something to eat. By the time we got to our gate we only had 5 minutes until boarding. This is not the first time we have had this issue at the Dallas airport either American Airlines.",1
The DFW Airport has good sinage and helpful airline employees. However the Prospect wheelchair services on Wednesday were less than professional....arguing among fellow workers and with supervisors and they demonstrated very little cooperative teamwork. The airport was busy and needed everyone working together.,1
"Absolute worse TSA check in. This is my 3rd flight out of DFW this week and every time it’s the same extremely long security wait times (AM flights from terminal A, B, and E this week)  I rarely write reviews / complain but due to today’s events I felt it necessary (and… I have nothing else to do as I stand in this line).  At terminal B American Airlines on 7/26/23 at ~11am, there is only 1 lane running for TSA precheck, priority, and regular.  At one point another employee came to check people in and open up a 2nd lane. After 15 mins, this employee got frustrated with a confused, non-English speaking passenger and after publicly ridiculing him announced that she quit and is not showing up to work tomorrow.  Incredibly rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional.
DFW needs to redistribute TSA employees to alleviate the bottle necks. Consistently worse security wait times compared to any airport across the country.",1
"Two flights within a month same departure gate C21. Twice Wait time checkpoint 44 mins. Dirty place beyond recognition and rude staff of course…who would like to work in a dump like this. As a frequent flier I  can only compare this section of the airport to Atlanta Airport.
It feels more like a greyhound terminal than an airport.
What a shame. Good bye to the joy of flying.",1
"If you are chemically sensitive, DO NOT go to this airport. I swear they have hidden fragrance machines in the walls and ceilings that are constantly spraying everyone with the equivalent of axe body spray all the way through customs. Absolutely sickening. Any building occupied by this many customers at a time should be REQUIRED to be running HEPA filters in every room and using fragrance and chemical free cleaning solutions. The bottom line is, these chemicals are triggering dormant viruses and causing people to end up sick during or after travel. THIS is not freedom.",1
"Worst experience I have ever had in an airport.
Had connecting flights and despite requesting assistance from the airport staff all the way from customs through several security checks and having 2 hours to connect we still did not make it in time.
The arrogance and the incompetence of the staff in particular in the security check was truly one of a kind…
Definitely willing to do what it takes next time in order to avoid this airport….",1
"Awful, awful airport.  Terrible shuttle system between terminals.  Maybe announce what terminal the bus goes to?  Outdated systems and infrastructure.  And, as one can see in the pic, no bathrooms, only toilets.",1
"Love to visit Texas sometimes multiple times a year, even the Airport, with some delays ect is good , I have no issues with the Airport its self. However American Airlines TSA STAFF is the rudest, disrespecting ,militant, sadest that I have  ever come across,  I love to travel. However I hate going through the DFW  security only because of staff ,not the lines wait ect just them ,I absolutely hate it!  It gets worse  every year! Whoever is in charge teach them manners and respect, to the staff you are not only security, you are also in customer service you are the worst ever!!! If you dislike your job that much find a new one you are horrible and miserable at it..... to the Person in charge of them you need replaced if you don't change the situation 💯!",1
"Absolutely awful airport. Poorly designed, takes forever to get anywhere, the monorail screeches super loud, and good luck finding info about connecting flights. If you didn’t notice, they’re posted on small screens with 20 pages of scrolling information moving quickly. Complete idiocy. More evidence that Texas sucks. DFW should post pictures of the airport designers throughout the place so people can throw mustard at them.",1
I would give them 0 stars because TSA precheck line was super long then I was told to leave the TSA precheck to have TSA number on the boarding pass then I was asked to join the super long line again. TSA agents were  rude and willing to help even I told them that I had waited in the TSA line for 15 minutes almost for my turn to go through clearance and was advised to add TSA on boarding pass. American Airline then instructed me join general check in which was quicker and faster than TSA precheck. They should really focus on improving TSA precheck process which is terrible when compared to other airports.,1
"American Airlines, went above & beyond to ensure that the flight from Dallas was LESS than acceptable. Flight attendant 'Tai' ensured that despite a doctor's prescription to have my medicine with me ""at all times"" that I had to stow my size appropriate carryon (I was the first to board, so there was space & even after everyone was boarded, there was still space)... He was RUDE & it was uncalled for... Customer service is NOT one of his strengths & apparently he enjoys having power/control over carryon luggage.",1
"I took a flight from Las Vegas to Dallas the onto a connecting flight to XNA. I needed to use wheelchair service for my trip which was arranged upon booking my flight. My flight landed at 407 pm and my next flight was at 444 pm. We were told on the arriving flight to go straight to our gate and to not even stop for the rest room.
Wheelchair service picked me up and put me on this cart that zoomed through the airport. Then the driver took me to an elevator and then set me on another cart. There was no driver or anyone around. “Sit here and put on your seat belt. I’ll find someone.  So I sat for 10 minutes and no one came. (Boarding stops 15 minutes before the flight leaves. I saw another woman driving a cart so I asked her if she could help me. She said I’ll call someone and took off. A few minutes later a man came strolling around the corner and I heard the last boarding call for my flight. I asked him if we were going to still make it and he said yes. Then he drives me to another elevator then he said they should’ve put you on the skylink. I’m only going this far. By then I was so worried about missing the flight. He asked if I could stand on the escalator that will take me down since the elevator didn’t seem to be working. I stood on the escalator and when we got to the bottom there was Another cart and as I walked to that he said no you have to sit there and pointed to some chairs. There was a lady sitting at a podium. I told her my situation and she said ok I’ll call someone. I then heard the final boarding call. I again asked her where the wheelchair person was and she went to the bathroom leaving her phones and purses. Now my flight was about to leave and there was no one around and I missed my flight. I didn’t know what to do so shakily I began to walk towards my gate. I kept asking anyone who was working for help and explained I was handicapped and I was missing my flight after 7 people one who said I didn’t look handicapped, one girl finally told me she couldn’t help but she would find someone to help me and she saw a guy in a white shirt and shorts looking like an American Airlines guy who told me where the AA help desk was. By the time I got to it I was super weak and shaking and due to my weakness and the whole situation I was crying. Finally this lady for American Sirline (which is another story) got me on standby in another terminal. I explained how I was left and needed wheelchair service so she got a cart there and the driver took me to the gate and as we passed by the lady at the podium she gave me a dirty look. In all my travels I have never been in a situation like this. No one cared no one helped. It turns out that the other people who were taking the same connecting flight to Arkansas also missed their flight due to the wheelchair service at this airport and were met with the same indifference not only from Dallas FortWorth Texas but also American Airlines. Is this the attitude of the people there in general?  I’m from Las Vegas and there are definitely better caliber of people in that Region. Never again would I take a layover in this airport when I have to depend upon anyone else. The airport is big but definitely not better. Anyone needing wheelchair assistance BEWARE   Ps I gave it a one star only for the last two people that helped me.",1
I would give zero if there is an option. Staff are very rude and it’s not clean,1
"Be aware that late night flights give a horrible experience.  The baggage claim doors are closed except one, so you walk 5 mins around. The budget rental car let's you book after midnight but closes and merges with avis with only 3 people on the desk and 100 people waiting. Tsa closes at midnight for departing flights so if your flight is delayed or scheduled after midnight for departure,  you will not get on that frontier flight because there is no security, and frontier doesn't notify or disclose that information.  They just rebook you for another flight and make you sleep in the airport. My new flight didn't  depart until 10am",1
The rental car bus transportation situation is ridiculous. It takes 3 buses to get to the facility because they don’t have enough buses for customers traveling to the airport. Then it takes forever to get to the facility. Go to Love Field with southwest if you can as it is such a better setup.,1
"I figured since I’m stuck on the ground on the tarmac I’d go ahead and share my thoughts and opinions on this airport. It seems like there is always delays, the roads getting in and out are a joke, and overall it’s always problematic anytime I fly in or out, which is approximately every 2 weeks. It’s entirely more pleasant to fly in and out of Lovfield which is what I believe will be my new arrival and departure center.",1
"This airport is dirty and unclean. It is not well engineered for people making connecting flights. I had the worst experience on Sky Link and this airport is hands down the worst I have ever been to. If you plan on using the family bathrooms, be prepared for dirty nasty areas to change your children.",1
Frontier Airlines Supervisor is very unprofessional.   Rude to multiple people then stood up by the counter going on about some lady needs to mind her own business.,1
"The International Airport doesn't even have the smoking section once you pass the security check. Some flights are like 14 hours long, and it's too stressful.",1
"I just moved to Dallas from Seattle which means that when I travel, I'm flying out of DFW now. The availability of flight options is terrible. Most of my life I've flown out of Boston or Seattle and this airport just doesn't compare. Don't even get me started on the lack of signage and absolute confusion that is DFW. I have a wedding to attend in Boston in early April of 2023 and have been watching flight prices for about a month and a half now (the wedding is still over a month away), praying that they'll go down-- they haven't. Out of frustration and curiosity, I wanted to see the flight options and prices for Seattle to Boston. IT WAS HALF THE PRICE OF DFW and not to mention many more options on airlines and times. Twice the distance yet half the cost? This isn't the only trip that this is true for. I've also been planning to travel to South Carolina for Mother's Day. My flight will cost about $600-$700 whereas my Mother's (flying from Boston) is $150. This is round trip and approximately the same distance. I now dread flying and shopping for airline tickets. DFW, I'd love a reasonable explanation for why your prices and availability are as bad as they are. This feels like robbery.",1
Several Escalated sidewalks not working. A/C not working in A to B corridor. Terminals smell like sewer. Escalaters in term C broken every other week. So much construction going on at every entrance and exit it's confusing at times even for someone who knows the way around this place!,1
Horrible connection for airlines. Multiple airlines but especially American Airlines have absolutely ZERO organization through Dallas International Airport. I'll avoid ever having to go through DFW at any and all costs. Last min terminal changes that have you going halfway around the airport is ridiculous. Anyone who See's this avoid DFW by any means necessary.,1
Flight delayed and gate changed to another terminal 30 min before flight.,1
Very Very Very Bad Airport. You have to wait for 2 hours in the runway so your plane can have a parking g spot. They only hive you one biscuit and then yhay say only 10 mins but it is 2 hours. We had the airline frontier from Washington to Dallas. It was a very bad experience overall.,1
"This airport is horrible! I have had nothing but bad experiences with this airport, my baggage was delayed for 4 days while I was on vacation so I was on vacation without clothes or hygiene products, and it was very inconvenient, the second circumstance was we had a connecting flight the plans we were on arrived late and we ran to our other connecting flight it says the plane didn’t depart until 8:50 and we arrived at 8:35 to bored considering it wasn’t our fault because our previous flight was late, the man at the gate told us the gates were closed and we could not go on, and referred us to customer service for them to book us on another flight at 10:30, which was a terminal on the other side of the airport we asked around on how to get to it nobody was helpful one worker led us outside the airport on the bus and made us go through security again and security was closed by then !! The workers here are absolutely useless, I won’t be flying through DFW again considering how many issues I have had with them if I could give zero stars I would.",1
"Worst experience here flying frontier. They first delayed the flight for over 4 hours then stated they would be getting a new airplane waited until the last minute to tell us the flight was actually canceled and did the worst job at getting us back to our destination. I ended up booking with a completely different airline to get home.
No accommodation for a hotel, meals nothing. Next flight was over 24 hours flight time to another city with a long layover then back to our city.
I guess they expected us to sleep in the airport. They do not adhere to the regulation or rules of the money they owe us for the delays and cancellations some bs excuse as to why they can’t refund us.
Never again the worst and most unprofessional people working at this airline here. Rude angry workers laughing at passengers asking questions. Dressed completely unprofessional. Even the managers here are a joke. I had the pleasure of speaking with a frontier manager stopped speaking to me for over 5 minutes left me there at the counter and started talking to a co worker and then another person.  After I started yelling then she came back and said she never stopped helping me yada yada. They stole expensive shoes out of another lady’s suitcase. It’s madness if ur flying out of DFW or ATL don’t use frontier they are a joke. Spend a little extra and do yourself a favor you deserve better than frontier. Do better y’all are ghetttttooooo.",1
American airlines employees are rude and I would not recommend using American airlines ever.,1
"Arrived in the international terminal to a very disorganized Global Entry check-in area. Claimed our luggage to have it re-checked and literally thrown onto the conveyor belt. TSA pre check was closed and the security line was ridiculously long - probably 500 people. You can't even share your frustrations because you're considered hostile and a risk, when in all other professions you can at least share your concerns. I'm not sure when airport personnel became unaccontable but it's evident in how they treat travelers and it's disgusting. DFW is always a mess when coming back from anywhere international. DO BETTER DFW!",1
"WORST airport experience ever! Flight was late, then no terminals were available, we're told to take a train to our 2nd flight then told we weren't on it, given a standby flight to find that ticket is also bogus! An entire day of our cacation spent in this dump of an airport. THANKS ALASKA, NEVER USE YOU AGAIN!!!",1
"Is there less than no stars? 10 flight delays, 3 re-bookings, 7 gate changes, sending us from one concourse to another only to turn around and go back to the one we started at. Spent 2 hours stuck on the tarmac waiting for a gate uppon arrival. No explanation, good weather, over 24 hours of delays. This airport is a joke.",1
The worst airport I have ever been to. Anytime my fiancé or I have connections here there is some kind of delay or closure that will make you late to or completely miss your flight. I try to avoid this place as much as possible,1
"So crowded. I had special assistance. First guy abandoned me. Took 20 min to get another guy to wheel me. Then my gate changed. Too many people, Seems completely disorganized. I hate this airport for layovers, by far the worst.",1
"We normally have a great experience with DFW we fly AA, however, this experience has greatly upset us! We had a cancelled flight and therefore chanced us to another flight. While waiting for that flight to take off it was cancelled because the pilot was over on his hours to legally fly! They NEVER notified us of where our luggage would be we were just left in the wind. We had to ask the boarding workers, they sent us to baggage claim, they sent us to the check in gate. It is 24 hours later and our bag took off to Tennessee AFTER we put in a request for it to remain at DFW! After calling 2 times to see when we can get our bag back home 2 different people cannot find our luggage…. What a disaster they really need to work on a solution for luggage being returned to customers the night the flight is cancelled!",1
I was very uncomfortable when I was being patted down by a biological female who is transitioning to be male. I honestly feel violated.,1
"Going to Australia, we literally spent 45+ mins on the tarmac because they had such a huge back up.  Coming back in to Dallas, we got there early and had to SIT on the tarmac for 30 mins because our gate wasn’t ready (not sure how we arrived an hour early from an Australian flight). Now, trying to go from Dallas to Lexington we had our flight delayed AFTER we got on the plane because the pilot isn’t here. Before that, people had to play musical gates. They’d get to the new gate just to be told they switched it already to yet ANOTHER ONE. I will never be flying Qantas, American, or through Dallas ever again. People in this airport were also extremely rude.",1
"On Friday the 16th my family and I were supposed to be on a flight from Dallas to Monroe at 4:11 but there was no connecter for the plane to go, we were sitting on the plane for about 15 minutes waiting to get off, we when we arrived we rushing back and forth to get on a tram to go to our destination, when we arrived we went to our gate and they told us to go to gate B19 where the lady gave our seats to people on standby when we were standing right in front of her and she ignored and went onto the plane and we couldn’t get a flight until 10:45 at night. I think nobody should be treated this way.",1
"TSA precheck members very rude & sarcastic, very unprofessional & unpleasant",1
"Don't Do It!! American Airlines Employees are the Worst at Customer Service and they will close the gate on you and then have a attitude with the Customer because they ask why the gate is closed..I seen a Rep Physically knock a customers phone out their hand.. she should have been fired but GOD Don't Like Ugly and she definitely was. She wouldn't have done a white man like that but I'm glad he pick his phone up and stayed calm never raised his voice.. The whole while she was screaming I'm going home"" But you never know who's watching!👀",1
The heat doesn’t work at terminal C crazy and not at all comfortable !     Temperature around 35 F. 01/15/2024,1
"Worst airport I have ever been in. No one chose to think at all. They rerouted our terminal, then cut off the sky train so we couldn't even travel within the airport to get to our gates. We had to leave the airport at 1 am, and figure out how to get from the D terminal to E. Then we got to the terminal link bus and the guy didn't stop. So we had to work Google to call the airport to send another terminal link. Then we had to wait on TSA to open back up at 4, which the airport people told us TSA opens at 3:30, then 3:45, and then 4:30am. It actually opened at 4 am. The electrician working on terminal E was more helpful than the customer service over the phone. Also no one was at the terminals to help us. We got bits and pieces because of their mess ups and lack of communication",1
"Airport desperately needs updates & Renovations. This is too much of a major Hub to continue to have a 1980's appearance & please discontinue the usage of the plexiglass barriers thru the TSA checkpoint. They are completely unnecessary, smothering & ineffective

Update 1/18/2024: This airport sucks! Invest more money in the building design & infrastructure, and less on the rude & non-helpful employees you have there! Ask Jerry Jones for investment dollars, since he can't put a Super Bowl caliber Football organization together!",1
"I had to go to terminal E to check in and go through TSA security but my gate was in D terminal, so after going through security there’s no gate D and I freaked out and had to ask for help and they said I would have to catch the skylink train all the way at the end of terminal E and ride the skylink to terminal D to my gate… it’s confusing and needs to be redone",1
"Every single time I have to go to Dallas for a connecting flight, something goes wrong. Either plane is not here on time so I miss my connecting flight, or flight is over sold or Plane can't leave due to mechanical issues. Then trying to get help from anyone late at night, hotel questions, or nearest shuttle phone, Good Luck. They just look at you and turn their back  because they want to go home.. then if you do get someone to acknowledge you, they couldn't be any ruder. American Airlines, get a whole new crew for the night shift Customer service women at the rebooking counter.",1
"2 times & 2 different flights, going on vacation to FSD flt #855 & my return trip to BWI Flt #2251 gates changed 4 times both trips. Ran out of soda & snacks on flight #2251. Hate my trip thru DFW. Instead of a 3 hr layover it was 5 hours!! No communication for all the gate changes. Not a good 1st time experience for me at DFW!!",1
Deep in my heart I know my sons chain was stolen out of my luggage at this airport. It’s sad because he got it for his first birthday. It was one of a kind. I don’t have the proof but I know this was the airport. Ima call it a loss even tho it really sucks… I will never get caught lacking again. So enjoy his chain.,1
"They really took all of the meanest and rudest people in the entire world and gave them a job at this airport. One of the TSA agents told the entire crowd that they didn’t want us there anymore and that we need to hurry up and get out of there. News flash, nobody wants to be in that horrible place either! If I can do anything in my power to avoid this airport I absolutely will.",1
Dirty bathrooms. Crowded. Tram car broke and wouldn’t let us out for 10 minutes. Long taxis to runways (15+ minutes from gate) and long waits at gates. Multiple delays made me miss connection.,1
"Signage is terrible
The map inside the airport says ride share is on the top level. It's on level one instead",1
Pretty sure a 3 year old with a crayon designed this place. Would rather have my teeth pulled then drive through this stupid airport,1
"Every layover at DFW leads to a delay, a canceled flight, an air team time out, or even an overnight stay at the airport, usually due to storms in the area. TSA does not start until 5:00 am, so early morning flights are difficult, increasing the likelihood of an overnight stay in the airport. Avoid this airport for any layover if possible.",1
"I have flown out of DFW a couple hundred times by now, therefore, my review comes with a fair bit of experience. The fact that you STILL have to take the outdoor, green, shuttle-bus between terminals is nothing short of ridiculous. And it's an act of God if your return flight actually lands at the same terminal you departed from. Do better DFW...good grief...do better.",1
Walked the whole E terminal looking for a Dr. Pepper and guess what... None to be had! I will never fly here again!,1
Don’t expect any assistance from the customer service department here!!! They don’t care about you or your experience! Your just another ticket! I was here on business and was super tired I fell asleep and missed my flight! They won’t care and will make you purchase another ticket! The lady was extremely rude who talked down to me as I can’t say she helped me! She was cold hearted and un caring!!! Screw American airline!!! This will be my last flight with them! There are other options and I suggest choosing the other airlines!!!,1
"I've been through 4 airports in the last 5 months with the same items that I have traveled with before,  but now some jackass with a bad attitude takes my stuff here at DFW. If it can go through 8 TSA stops, why now is it different? All TSA checkpoints need to follow the same guidelines. It's not just me, the people in front of me said they have had the same issues.
Not to mention, I have had 3 gate changes within 20 minutes.",1
Can’t handle volume. International flight comes in and the line was so long that we missed our connection.,1
"Another delay!! Not surprising. Every flight since Covid that I have been on has been delayed, missing connection flights due to the multiple delays. The domino effect. Get it together DFW. Customers should get a return when delays cause customers to spend the day in the airport. GET IT TOGETHER.",1
We missed our flight because Customs didn't have enough help. The line wrapped around  the entire floor.  I feel that our airline should have been notified to hold up 10 or 15 minutes.,1
"I've been traveling to this airport for at least 30 years and this weekend was the worst trip I've ever had.  I arrived in Dallas (DFW) and was expected to go through customs, pick up my bag and make it to the gate for my connecting flight in 36 minutes (due to the plane being almost 2 hours late) which wasn't physically possible for most people. I literally RAN and didn't get my luggage to make the flight. I understand there were storms in Dallas but not holding a plane (delaying it) when I'm fairly certain that around 50 people or more didn't make it doesn't make sense. I'm aware that American Airlines would have probably put me in a hotel and sent me home the next day, but not everyone has the luxury of the extra day. If more than 50% of the passengers are not making it from connecting flights, the flights should be held back until at least 80% of the people can get there.",1
Traffic always block in terminal A coz of uber queue,1
"Skylink does not work at the midnight everyday even it claims to work for 24 hours. The alternative Term Link is very inefficient. You need to wait for quite a long time. Really, really terrible experience.

After I take a terminal Link, there are so many people. We need the skylink, especially in the midnight of Sunday. The termlink shuttle is not frequent. It is full. People are waiting for a lot of time.",1
"Worst experience for an entryway into the US. The lines are slow and the ushers seem to show a preference for who they will send over to the shorter line. Getting your luggage is another nightmare. Some dude was on the other side pulling bags off and stacking them in the isle! Why!? If another passenger had not said something I would have been standing there for  an hour.

The customer service sucked. The employees milling were no help when needed and could not communicate clearly. The TSA pre-chek was the longest! Yikes! Waste of money.",1
"Bad design and layout.
Hard to drive with all the go carts speeding in this race track.
Not everyone has it memorized they don't let you drive in here carefully.
It needs speed bumps and traffic signals.",1
The traffic stuck on the uber queue. Which cause a lot trip cancellation. It cause high toll prices. Uber queue should move back to outside.,1
American need to do repairs on their broken aircraft. 3 hours waiting on the tarmac is unacceptable.,1
"Whoever is in charge of the security check ins should be promptly fired. It should not take 26 minutes for some one to get thru security with a line that is 1/3 of other airports I have been in, including new york city.",1
"Five stars for cleanliness, shopping and restaurants - and a MINUS TEN stars for the complete ineptitude of the company they contracted with to get passengers with disabililities smoothly from one terminal to another in a timely fashion. I will never fly through this airport again, and highly recommend Chicago-O’Hare as having far better services for passengers with disabilities.",1
There is like one immigration person working. Getting a connecting flight isn’t looking great. A week ago the airlines struggled to keep their flights. I won’t be flying through Dallas in the future.,1
If I was desperate to get to brazil enduring less mental strain I would ride all the way there on a bicycle.,1
Not enough places to eat without lines that go for miles.  Half of the airport smells like urine. The air tran takes forever to get where you need to go. Taxi times feel like hours. But they do have power plugs under the seats so at least that's something good.,1
"Really big. Shuttles go in one direction only, you may get stuck going 90% around entire airport. Poor selection of restaurants too. Houston airport is more accommodating. Hungry and no food to buy! Grrrr",1
Lol always have a horrible airport experience here. There's is a fee! Never had to pay a fee for just dropping or picking someone up... You get a ticket for entry and then when you leave you provide the ticket and pay $2+ depending on how much time you've spent there. last time the credit card machine was down and we spent 20 min waiting. Then they started letting people go. The people at the booths are normally very rude and do not want you talking to them. Even when ur trying to give them change. It's also very confusing to park or pick someone up. Would not recommend this place,1
"Long wait for customs just for a guy to look at your passport and your face and say ok.  Very few lines open.  Places that don't suck have that automated.  And then had to go through security again after coming off a major international flight from Japan for a connecting flight.  Have never had to do that before.  Had to throw away all of my drinks even though they were perfectly fine for the flight to Dallas.  Had to pick up my checked bag and then walk it 100 feet to deliver it to another conveyor belt.  Guess everything is a little dumber in Texas, idk.  Stupidest connection experience of my life.",1
"I’ve flown all over the world. I’ve never seen such a disorganized mess of an airport. 30  waiting seats in a gate for 150 people, no directions, impossible to find rental return (got charged $12 for driving through), TSA  checkpoints have a 1hr wait on one side and no one to advise you that the other side has a 4m wait.  Barely any signage anywhere that’s actually helpful (get some digital signs with messages, it’s 2022!!) My heart goes out to our seniors, new travelers and disabled individuals. This airport is a nightmare and it’s clearly due to poor design and bad management. Please hire a consultant to sort out this logistical nightmare!!

I also suspect some false reviews here. Who in their right mind is taking pictures of bathrooms and rating their design 5 stars??",1
"Wheelchair assistance was terrible. After getting wheeled up the gangway, it took over 30 minutes for them to coordinate further transfers. We all got onto 2 carts that took us to an elevator. Even though elevator was big enough to hold the cart, we all had to get off and on the elevator. After getting off the elevator, and about 20 minutes of staff confusion, we were brought to another elevator. Same drill --- ride down and get on a 3rd cart.
So, it took a wheelchair ride and 3 cart rides,candy over an hour, to get from one terminal to another. Each driver did his best to shake down the crowd for a tip. What a disorganized racket!",1
"Whoever designed this airport is an idiot. They have ground cars which connect terminals every 12-30mins which is ridiculous, for me to get from terminal A to terminal E took over 40 Mins with a 12 min wait for the bus and and 25 min ride to there... Just to highlight how stupidly this airport is planned - it has an air train that operates every 2 Mins and quickly transfers people between terminals, BUT you can only use it after you're past security. I mean are they having a laugh? The reason most people need to get to the terminal is to check in their luggage... Why not have an airtrain that connects guests between terminals BEFORE THEY CHECK IN: that would get rid of the slow ground busses, be way more eco friendly and a lot more convenient for the guests and that's what every other airport that I have been to and has a train do, since it simply makes sense. Also the staff seemed overworked, since when the bus finally arrived the bus driver said he can't work any more since he has been driving for 12 hours (which is a Hazzard) and unhappy people who are potentially gonna be late for their flights had to bed for him to drive them.
If you're planning to use their transport please arrive an hour extra before you planned since I have missed flights because of this nonsense of slow transfer between terminals. Also thank you to teh Frontier staff who re-booked after I was late which was quite surprising for a low cost courier, but it seemed they are aware of this mismanaged mess.
Good luck.",1
Tsa was extremely slow with passengers returning to the US from international trips resulting in missed connecting flights. The size of the airport is so large its next to impossible to make  a connecting flight if there is the slightest delay.,1
"Please repair the roads  to each terminal , request the CEO of DFW Airport  to take a drive and experience it ?
Toll gates are slower than a remote toll gate in Northern India",1
My flight was delayed several times. I made it home 3 hours later than my original arrival time. The food and stores were good and the terminals were well kept.No smoking areas without going all the way outside of the airport. A smoking section at each terminal would be a good addition,1
Worst airport I've ever been to.  They have a scam going on handicapped people.  I asked for wheelchair assistance and instead they put me on an 8 passenger cart. Then drove to an elevator and made me get on another one 4 different times.  Each driver held his hand out for a tip. They all could communicate with each other and spoke a foreign language so you had no idea what they were saying. Worst experience ever!!  I will never fly into this airport again!!!😡,1
"This is the worst airport. We’ve experienced massive delay and missing baggage. Also, you have to wait long lines to get to anything",1
"Traveling throughout the airport was fairly easy to navigate. The employees they chose to be “gate representatives” were absolutely horrendous. I’ve been to many airports and this was by far the most disrespected and horrific treatment we have ever received by someone employed by an airport. Gate A14, AA2736 June 10, original flight scheduled at 3, delayed til 4:15. It was SO bad, When getting onto our actual plane / flight, we asked American Airlines attendants if the same people scanning our boarding passes (gate representatives) worked for AA and they do not. So, DFW, look into these horrific human beings you hired to speak to the general public. You don’t tell your passengers “we won’t miss you & we will leave without you” when we arrive at 2:55 to
Board a flight that leaves @ 4:15. Not only were they very arrogant, ignorant in their job and the information regarding the flight, they were HORRENDOUS nasty public representatives of your airport. Someone needs to check these women. Awful.",1
They funking over booking the flight now we have to wait a day,1
"I'm disabled now. Good luck getting wheel assistance entering terminal C. Not a person in sight. Requested help online through American, no help there either. Guess I'm done flying.",1
"We flew into DFW from our vacation in Puerto Vallarta. Our arriving flight from PVR was 30 minutes late, making our connection time a bit short (55 minutes). We ran through the airport and breezed trough immigrations and customs. We were making good time and were on track to make it onto our connecting flight. That is until we hit the security checkpoint at the terminal D. My husband forgot his water bottle in the backpack, which triggered the bag search. The lady doing the search was moving at a snail pace, taking forever. She was elderly, plus sized and appeared to have difficulty getting around. She used a push cart to transport every bag. She would slowly drag 1 bag at a time off the conveyor to the cart, slowly drive it to the x-ray and then slowly search the bag. As she dragged our backpack off the belt, she accidentally opened a zipper and dropped everything from the backpack on the floor. She then couldn't bend down to pick anything up, so she had to call for help. The entire security line stops and we all stand and wait for someone to show up and help her to collect the items off the floor. The other TSA officer came over and picked everything up and packed it away. The lady then proceeded to push the cart with the single backpack to her x-ray station with the snail pace. At this point there were 6 bags selected for search on the belt. All of the passengers are in a hurry, waiting for her and panicking. We all stand there observing this train wreck. Once she scanned our bag, she slowly removed the water bottle and handed us the bag without a single word or even eye contact. It was like we weren't even there. The entire process took 20 minutes. Considering we had 55 minute connection, this was the majority of our time at one station. We almost missed the flight and were completely livid after this experience. It was so disrespectful and intentional, that it left us completely speechless. We've been frequent flyers for years and flew through many airports. This was the first time we encountered something like this.

DFW why do you hire people that hate their job so much?",1
"Terrible airport! Flew out of terminal C and there was nothing in it to eat of any quality. The AA lounge was also in need of an upgrade (staff and facility) - out of food, drinks served in plastic, ....

This airport is on par with the DFW metroplex; flat, yellow, spread out and ugly. I'd rate it second only to Kansas City airport in this award winning category 🤔",1
"I absolutely hate how this airport wheel chair service is run.  I fly first class so I can make my connections,  the wheel chair service.. if they show up, make you wait until every passenger is off the plane instead of just wheeling us as we get off like every other airport.   I am going to stop flying american because this is their hu. And no one cares",1
"Bathrooms were filthy. Dirty, no toilet paper. This was both coming I and return trip. Approximately a week apart. Flew American airlines.  Very disgusting bathrooms.",1
"Came in from a connected flight at 18:30 and everything was closed
I had a baby to feed and we wanted some hot food
Nothing was open",1
"Get more restrooms, stop being cheap. The amount of restrooms here is not enough, they are always full. Also Checked my bag, and now it looks beat to hell. Take photos of your luggage if you plan to let these animals touch your stuff.",1
"If this airport is on your itinerary, cancel and take ANY other form of transportation. Unbelievably poorly-maintained facilities (at least in Terminal A) - do better, DFW.",1
"This big ol' International airport has zero eateries open past 10:30pm?! Seems like a major oversight and injustice with flights coming and going 24/7. And don't bother asking airport employees if they know of any food vending machines, apparently it's your fault if flights are delayed. You should have planned better. 🤦",1
DFW Airport rental car return signage is not correct. This is an ongoing problem leading people returning cars to rental center at the wrong location…thus delaying and causing airline travelers to possibly miss flights. This is a long standing problem on the Airport grounds that has been addressed with nothing being done by the DFW Airport officials. Please make the simple corrections to signage to direct travelers to “The Rental Return Center”.,1
I arrived on an international flight and the line for customs was OUTRAGEOUS. There was no signage for American/Canadian/Global entry until you waited in the line and got to the front of it. I happened to ask 1 of 2 people in place to manage all the arriving international flights. The line looked to be about a 1/2 mile long.,1
Airplane not at gate it was supposed be at. Skylink broke down and almost missed flight,1
"The airport is fine, but don't go here if you are making a connection from an international flight. The CBP officers are angry and rude. Office Brooks might be the nastiest person I've encountered in years. A truly horrible person selectively screen people said they had connecting flights. Horrible, horrible, horrible.",1
"We had a flight scheduled for today with American Airlines. The flight was cancelled which wasn’t the issue. It is all In how it was handled. We arrived on time to get checked in, all flights except for a handful were still scheduled to fly. Our 7 o clock time was pushed back, by 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and then it was set to 10 pm. It was abruptly changed to 9 pm at which point the gate clerk told us that wasn’t realistic and our flight was most likely going to get cancelled because they didn’t have enough flight attendants. We were missing two. 30 minutes later a suit came over and told us it was cancelled. Only 5 hrs of my life I won’t get back. When the suit told us that it was cancelled all 100+ of us were sent into a mad dash to gate D24 or D28 to try and rebook. I called the help line while my wife went into the line for D24. I went to the gate clerk station while on hold and asked how I can get my checked bag. The suit told me I can’t (he is only the suit because he didn’t introduce himself, I wonder why). That’s right I cannot get my own belongings. They are going to be flown to Chicago, my desired destination. I then asked if my luggage is going to Chicago why can’t I? How am I going to get my medication? I was dismissed without an answer and told to call the number I am currently on hold for 2 hrs and 15 minutes. Seems like I am being stalled so I will just go away. I am waiting on customer relations to talk with me. Maybe I will eventually figure out how to get my daily prescription meds.",1
"I give it -1 star , By far one of the worst airports I’ve ever been … airports supposed to be easy to access ,easy to exit … it is the most bizarre way to enter or exit an airport in the world , I traveled a lot domestic and internationally never had issue with directions except this airport ,, flight always delayed , not impressively clean , overpriced in everything. Horrible experience with Texans in general.",1
"HORRIBLE AIRPORT PER USUAL. FLIGHTS ARE NEVER ON TIME. OVER CROWDED, unintelligent employees, extremely dirty facilities. Horrible horrible airport.",1
Terrible service with American airlines. They take no responsibility once you buy the tickets and will absolutely not work to resolve issues. They would rather have me book a whole new flight than wait for my COVID results which was over expensive.,1
"Staff is clearly extremely untrained in customer service and extremely rude. Me and my group were yelled at numerous times about not knowing information that isn’t obvious and varies from airport to airport (do we put suitcases and laptops in their own bin etc.) Additionally, I witnessed many people who didn’t speak English being screamed at by TSA; this display was beyond appalling. The people who didn’t speak English were clearly trying to be cooperative and swift while these agents continued raising their voice at them. Overall, a terrible experience if you are able to avoid this airport please do!!",1
"Half an hour off the plane i found a spot to finally have a smoke after a 5 hour flight, way off in a dark corner where you can easily be mugged. Less tolerant of smokers than anywhere else in the states and honestly i dont know how they havent been sued yet for this",1
"Arrived to a full parking garage. No problem I’ll park at another terminal… only problem is that when you go pick up your bags you can’t use the sky link and they don’t have enough terminal link shuttles or drivers to get you from one terminal to another. Multiple calls to dispatch yielded no results. Same thing, one after another shuttle van shows up let’s 1 or 2 passengers off and no room for the 25 people waiting. Eventually I just called an Uber. Totally ridiculous considering how many tax dollars go to this place, the outrageous parking fees, and a freaking toll road as their road. Hey DFW…. Do better.",1
This place is a health hazard cockroaches  in the bathrooms. A lot of equipment is broken and not well maintained,1
"Hard to traverse. Dirty. Especially the restrooms have been...um...let's go with...stinky & sticky (to keep this review ""non-gagging""). Not good at all. Through large numbers of food options, there are few selections of different varieties. Staff have been very unhappy & not knowledgeable on a regular basis. When your employees aren't good, that tells how bad this airport is run. Very long security lines. Regular cancelation of flights. You can check in, but you can't fly out. I recommend that you avoid DFW as much as you can. I'd say completely stay away at all cost. Hopefully, it gets better, but the airport has a very long way to go in improvements.",1
"American Airlines was horrible 🤬. They canceled my flight and gave me a room in a sleep in place (wouldn't classify it as a ""Hotel"". They delayed my flights all day. I am not an American airline flyer, I was reminded again why I am not😳.",1
"If you’re given the option, don’t fly to DFW. The concourses and walkways are narrow but super long so you’re constantly dodging people. The tram is the ONLY way to get between terminals and it’s constantly overloaded and full. Finally, the bathrooms are cramped and the dirtiest I’ve ever experienced in any airport! Not recommended.",1
"This place is trash. The Remote South Shuttle was an hour behind, causing myself and others to miss their flights. Not only that, the shuttle drivers were rude, unprofessional and aggressive. Then there’s the operations department employees who I called to express my situation. Each Rep I spoke with either hung up on me or blind transferred me to a random department. I finally spoke with a supervisor who’s only offer of resolution was that I call the Risk Management Department which is closed. It’s abhorrent that this airline allows its employees to comport themselves in a manner that completely disrespects and disregard their customer.",1
"Got to airport at 8:30 for my 10:30 flight with American Airlines. Sat down to eat at flying saucer with my little brother, we had time right. Gate ends up changing to the other side of the airport. We head that way at 10, walk up on our gate 10:13-10:14. There was about 70 standby passengers trying to get on the plane and in the way. I get to the front and find a gate attendant. I show her my ticket, and she says she gave our seats up already, we needed to be there at 10:15. I look at the time, and tell her it’s 10:15 right now, what does she mean. She just walked off and gets behind the counter of 70 people. I’m now realizing I’m missing the flight for my brothers wedding, that I’m the best man for. I ask for the supervisor, after about 20 minutes she shows up, the plane has already been pushed back. I explain to her that our seats were given up prematurely, and while we were barely on time for their 15 min policy, we were on time. She explains we will be placed on standby and there’s nothing she can do, but to get in line behind the 70 people at the gate. I get in line. After another 50 minutes, I finally get to speak with the gate attendant that gave our seats away again. She tells me there is nothing she can do, go to gate D42 (the American Airlines customer service desk) we get there and see the longest line I have ever seen. At this point, I’m thinking we are probably going to have to make an 18 1/2 hour drive. My brother and I wait in this line for 4 hours. I’m not exaggerating. By the time I was at the front, we both had a headache and our feet were stinging. While I was in line, I actually bought one way tickets to Richmond VA for $1100 which is an hour from the airport I needed, Charlottesville VA. Thankfully, the lady at the customer service desk was very helpful and saved me $1100. She was able to put us on the same flight I had just booked in line, but without it costing us anything. That flight did not leave until 6:52 pm. So we sat at the airport for almost 12 hours. Funny thing is, our original flight got delayed all the way until 11:20 am, and we had a connecting flight. All of my friends on that plane ended up stranded in NY because they didn’t make it before the connecting flight, and had to rent a car and drive 6 1/2 hours from NY to Charlottesville VA. We ended up making it there before them.

All of that just to show what a joke American Airlines is. I usually fly Delta, which I considered less than American, until this experience.",1
"Vote to rename this airline: Dallas Fort Worthless.
Worst airport I have ever flown. They lost my baggage bc they failed to put it on my connecting flight as well as several other passengers. Additionally they changed the gate 3 minutes before boarding and didn’t mention until everyone was running up to the new gate that the departure had been delayed. They caused a half marathon across the airport because they can’t be bothered to care about their customers.

Reminder to those in line with me today for your lost bags - they are required by law to reimburse you up to $3,400 for items you had to buy to replace things that would have been in your luggage. You can submit the form through the airline directly with your receipts.

I’ll connect somewhere else, even if it is less convenient. Just so that I never have to fly through this airport again.

I have no clothes or shoes and it’s winter where I landed. Terrible employees. They should be embarrassed at how my flight was handled.",1
"The worst ever. Planes get cancelled. Running all over to try to get a plane that goes to our distination.  I use a cane because my spine is on my leg nerves. No one wants to help. My husband had to find a wheel chair himself. We are all over the place. Hopefully we can make it to Seattle tomorrow, to catch our cruise to Alaska.   Too many lazy people, here. It is very dysfunctional here! Hate it!",1
Horrible. Bathroom didn't have toliet paper. The person that was supposed to be cleaning was just sitting on the floor talking with someone.  Plus american airlines not only doesn't get you to your destination but they make you wait an hour and a half to get another flight!,1
"Worst Airport experience of my life by far. If you arrive on an international flight and get stuck at the baggage check to a domestic flight or your flights late and you have to re-ticket in the same location there are no water fountains or restrooms close by, older folks have to go upstairs to restrooms losing their place in line while no one stops people from cutting in line. In our case the American Airlines counters were understaffed. We stood in line over 4 hours after being told our transfers would be taken care of because our flights were late. Terrible airport as far as infrastructure and service for international arrivals.",1
DFW TSA pre line doesn’t open till 5 but nothing stating it’s on any website. Horrendous lines….so what was I actually paying for? Get your act together please.,1
"American Airlines is awful.  I am 70 years old. I have been traveling for over 24 hours trying to get home. They bungled my reservation, changed gates, times, dropped one of my flights and told me they refunded the seat charge.  They did not. I had go xo to two places to get my duplicate seat charge back. Their employees move like turtles, promise what they cannot deliver and are rude.  Don't fly American if you can a avoid.  Otherwise DFW is a good airport to go through",1
My connection flight was located here my first flight was delayed by 2 hrs. My flight leaving Dallas was also delayed two hrs. When got off the plane I ran to my next gate and they literally just closed the planes door. They told me the next flight leave in 6 am the next day. I was right there.,1
DFW has more broken escalators and moving sidewalks than any other airport I have been to.,1
Came through twice. Both times there was no wifi. I wasn’t notified of a gate change by American and almost missed my flight. Also there was a miscommunication and no pilot showed up for our flight.,1
Horrible. Our connecting flight landed late so our whole place was late and instead of postponing the flight ten minutes so the people on our plane could get across the airport to the plane it left without us all. It did take my luggage that was supposed to be a carry on but they kept letting people take on abundant carry one in San Diego my luggage wouldn't fit so the took it under and now my luggage is seeing the world maybe without me,1
"So slow and outdated. The wait going through security is way to o long. One line for screening is what one finds at regional airport. Try to avoid this airport if possible.
Also, if you have to return a rental car add another 15 to 20 minutes. The car drop off is quick but getting to your terminal- waiting on the shuttle and the drive takes the most time.  It seems the focus is on shopping at this airport an not on a efficient travel experience.",1
We had a 2 and a half hour layover and almost missed our flight between customs and getting back thru security. I usualy use a wheelchair because I can't walk or stand for long periods of time and we had to trek it on foot because their wheelchair people (who i usualy tip) are too slow. On top of that they didn't get all of our bags on thr plane. This airport is a dysfunctional wreck,1
Worst airport ever. Over an hour and 40 minutes to get through security. Almost missed my flight. It wasn’t even that busy. Can’t imagine what it would be like on a busy weekend travel day. Will never fly there again.,1
FIX YOUR GD TRAM SO PPL DONT MISS THEIR FLIGHTS AND/ OR RUN THE DFW OLYMPICS TO THEIR CONNECTING GATE,1
American Airlines closed the gate before the time posted and I am sad ☹️,1
DFW was very busy due to a storm the day before which caused flight cancellations. Many people were waiting in line to speak to a customer service person of which there were only two and hundreds of flyers needing assistance. Our flight was pushed 4 times and it was a long hot wait in the terminal. 12 hours to be exact. The security people were rather rude and even called the man behind me a giant instead of referring to him in a more polite way. They rushed us through so fast that I lost my cell phone in all the chaos. We went back and got it but had I not been made to feel like we were being booked into jail I probably would have not lost it at all. They only had one person checking IDs for all the people in line. I would avoid flying into that hub if possible. Also I heard many people talking about being told to go sleep on floors since they would not be providing hotel vouchers. Poor experience overall.,1
Kept canceling my boyfriends flights for no reason. They boarded and then canceled the flight. It was his birthday and his Grandpa passed away the day before. He just wanted to come home. I just want him to come home.,1
Too much waiting in flight. There is no gate available for 2 hours after landing a flight F9 3729. We all passengers suffered 2 hours and 20 minutes in flight after landing.  Very pathetic and bad experience in my life ever seen.,1
"Transferring flights, I was intercepted, along with other passengers, by CBP after all security checks entering the passenger boarding bridge. They demanded a declaration of how much monetary value was I carrying, and the officer handed me a piece of paper, not a declaration form, to write down the amount. I wrote I was carrying less than 10k and he insisted I write down the exact amount. When I question what would happen if I didn't write the exact amount, he told me they would forfeiture all my cash. The officers were rude and aggressive, unnecessary harassment of citizens appears to be the policy at Dallas/Fort Worth international Airport.
I shall try not to take flights with Dallas lay over stops whenever possible.",1
"D19 Security line at 4am was impossible...

The line was 12 gates long, over an hour for TSA Pre check.

DFW airport needs to do some work on this.",1
"No smoking area after security. Need to hire more people to assist others with disabilities. 1 airport personnel handle and push 3-4 customers is simply unacceptable for an airport.

Airlines constantly changing terminals. Large airport (easy to miss flights, takes forever to get to gates).

Personnel are kind, but because of design and rules, this one of my least favorite airports.",1
"God knows how this place has above a one star, the only airport worse is JFK",1
"Giving them a 1, because of their parking department. Parking is overpriced. My card linked to the toll tag was suspended; no one can tell why it was suspended. No fraud occurred; but DFW and NTTA suspended my toll tag. To make matters worse; they bill me and then charge a $15 administrative charge on top of their $27 terminal daily fee. If you have a toll tag; put in a back up card. Lesson learned. $15 to send me a paper bill; WOW!",1
"25 min power walk from the gate to customs and immigration. 45 min wait on bags. Despite clearing security on a previous flight, they  make you clear security again and thus confiscated my duty free. Security line(which was almost out of the building)  just stopped for 20 mins for a staff change over. Missed my connection. Now I’m stuck here in this Escher hell scape. American Airlines staff at the gate (they kept the plane waiting for me for a long time) we’re very helpful.",1
Crazy traffic on busy time coz of Uber queue. That cost a lot of toll. Please do something about the Uber queue.,1
"Sweet baby Jesus, what a monstrosity of an airline.

$79.00 to check in an almost-personal-item-sized bag. I seriously thought about bashing off the wheel so it could fit in the personal sized box because buying a new bag would be a fraction of the price of $79.00.

Though this one star is not only for this trip. It's for all my trips in Spirit. I wish I could avoid flying this hell-plane but they are the only choice for some destinations.",1
"Rude,unprofessional,  dis organized,  made us miss our flight, then stuck us on another flight in seats not together, where we paid for seats upfront, lost money because of over booking, poor customer service. Part of problem was airline and part was miss management of the airport itself.",1
Rude people helping the handicapped.  Asked me to push my mom in the wheelchair for him Barely made connection because we were left on the runway for 40 minutes in first plane.,1
"Horrible facility if you have a late night connecting flight.  No comfortable seating to get any kind of sleep, there is a floor cleaning machine that is as loud as a lawn mower that runs from 12 midnight until 4am. The sound echos all through terminal C and you will not be able to escape it. The escalators are old and noisy as well.  Nothing is open late night, and the terminal is shop worn, smelly, filthy and not a relaxing environment at ALL.  I will never connect through DFW again.  AVOID FULL STOP.",1
"We were in transit at DFW on route from UK to NZ, on American Airlines (AA).
The whole experience was a complete shambles, the signage at the Airport is very poor and most staff, especially the AA staff were unable or unwilling to help (sadly it was the same story on the aircraft).
We definitely won't be going via DFW, nor flying with AA ever again.",1
Wait almost 2 hours to enter the US. Long line and 2-3 officers working.,1
"If you land at DFW with American Airlines, expect delays to your travel and more than likely a cancellation of flight. You’re better off Ubering across the nation.",1
Bad to say today while my husband was in the line just right in front of the inmigration area... A couple look like Latín american people were weird and laughting but when l came from restrooms I saw my husband's backpack opened and that couple moved into 3 person behind us... We called to lost and stolen things because they tried to stole a laptop but they just stole a cap a souvenir from Aruba. Watch you our own things.,1
We took American airline and had to walk from gate A  to D a good 30min walk once we got there gate chafed to another D gate and then again to gate B.  Luckily we had enough time else we will miss our flight.  The tram stopped walking and everyone is running to their connections flight.  A cart came and we got on to the B gate instead of walking the driver didn’t like our $10 tip and expected more.  This is crazy.  Never again I will fly American or connection to Dallas if I don’t have to,1
"Where to start?  Who is responsible for signage around the airport?  Is it so messed up that signs and a masters degree in civil engineering could still lead to failure? Or, are they trying to make the largest airport on earth by spreading it out?  I don't know the answer either.  Are all staff at the airport selectively deaf as a result of those who angrily found their way to the airport? I don't know either.  I do know there are more staff than the federal government wandering around aimlessly or just plain engaged in chit chat about the latest Hair color or whatever makes their hands flail with emphasis to each other ( hint: it is not about their work ).  So my ticket was canceled upon arrival.  No one could figure out why?  With a counter upcharge, they could fix it.  Yay for them!  TSA wait time, miscalculated by 20 minutes.   16 minute wait was 36.  I got a call from the travel agent who said that ""my coupon"" wasn't validated?  Meaning I never went through TSA, never boarded, and consequently never flew to the destination where I received the call?  She told me they may not let me fly back because I never officially flew out?  I don't know either.  I was able to fly back without issue.  Upon landing, let the chaos begin again.  The baggage carousel bonanza.  22-28-18 hike hike!  So where does someone pick you up?  I don't know that either.  We settled on 28 for an hour.  Without luggage.  Now the 2 women deeply engaged in hand flailing had no idea that people were even there.  Or had been waiting.  Or that no luggage had arrived.  When a gentleman so rudely interrupted their conversation to inquire, we were at carousel 16.  They don't know how that happened.  Lack of attention by staff?  I don't know but I feel confident it had something to do with it.  It had been so long that our luggage was spinning on 16 that they pulled it off and put it in lockers. Not just mine, THE WHOLE FLIGHT.  Don't you think someone would say, gee, no one is claiming baggage. Something is wrong.  What flight is this from and what does the board say?  Nah.  Not the case.  That would require thinking, action, and most importantly interrupting a different set people involved in conversation about the latest tennis shoes, gold chains, or hair weaves. So after retrieval of bag from DFW, I left that airport for the final time.  Good riddance!",1
"I've traveled all over the world and this place is in my top 5 for worst airports on the planet. Do you like missing your connecting flight because you have to walk 3+ miles and take a sky train to your next gate? Then this airport is for you. Do you like missing your flight because the gates are all over the place? Then this airport is for you! Luckily, the fine people at the Delta gate were able to help me get a flight home but the security and floor staff at DFW were hilariously unhelpful.",1
"Had a 3 hr layover that ended with us running to our gate bc they did not have a gate when we landed (35min on runway), then waiting for bags to go thru customs (45min), then had to go thru regular security again with lines out the doors (another 45min), then all the walking plus the sky train to get from D to B terminal. Everyone knows the DFW layout is terrible but such poor operation this time.",1
"I’m saddened to say my experience at the Dallas airport was horrible. While walking through tsa multiple security officers were yelling at travels who did not speak english and making fun of travelers who were not aware of the policies the Dallas airport has in place. I hope these officers can be educated in proper communication practices that welcome people who have had long flights from all over the world. Furthermore, customs agents were rude and there seemed to be many miscommunication between officers leading to confusion, missed flights, and an overall poor experience.",1
My flight gate always changes and i didn't get it updated in the app and the reps at the gates are rude and unfriendly!,1
"Worst airport in America. You can be assured that 20% of all flights in and out are going to be delayed, and that's before factoring in weather or other conditions. The bathrooms are filthy and the restaurants are laid out so that the nauseating smell of greasy food permeates the entirety of the airport.

If you can avoid this airport, do so. Treat it like the plague. Run far and run fast. You will spend more time than you want to here, which should be none at all.",1
This Spirit Airlines check in attendant was so rude! I don't understand how they can have people like this working here.,1
"Had to endure a 17 hour layover at this airport... after a 15 hour flight. How super fun. No restaurants at all before security. Was hungry, thirsty and the expensive vending machines were all that were available. I went to the AA desk agent and asked if she could get me on the earlier flight and she proceeded with a rude tone saying she couldn’t do anything because I had already checked in my luggage for the flight. Luggage arrived to my destination before me on the flight I begged her to put me on, fun. Spent the night layover at terminal D. There was a family with CHILDREN crying spending the layover as well. American Airlines is cheap as hell and provides no accommodation for long layovers whatsoever. I was only one person but refusing a family for accommodation? Won’t fly with them again",1
"Insufficient staffing everywhere. Only two stations were open for checking passports, the line took over an hour to get through for a US citizen. Security was terrible. Only one x-ray line was open out of two checkpoints.

No wheelchair help was given.
Gate checking a manual wheelchair was a terrible process. No one knew where the wheelchair was when we landed here. Had to wait 20 minutes after de-boarding to get our manual wheelchair.",1
Worst experience at this airport!!   Very disappointed!,1
"Broken luggage return, Terribly long security line up. Security could care less if you were to miss your connection. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO EXIT A SECURE AREA JUST TO RETURN TO THE SAME SECURE AREA! Especially since I was connecting to another flight. Was not offered a meal coupon. Pricing of everything was too expensive! $4.50 for a bottle of water and no fountains to be seen.",1
"The bathrooms in this airport are disgusting. No tissue, dirty. All while the workers are standing in the bathroom having a conversation. I asked them for tissue, they stated that the company does not.provide enough so nothing they can do. I said well put the stall out of service. They just looked like they didn't understand me. Bathrooms are very important, should be kept clean especially with all that's going on. Very disappointing.",1
"What a freaking nightmare! I will avoid this airport at all costs in the future.  Came in on American airlines, we sat on the runway for 20 minutes waiting for our  parking spot and then once it was available we waited another 30 minutes for someone to come out to direct us to the spot. The airport knows how many people need to go through customs yet only had 4 lines open (out of maybe 30-40ish). Obviously, we missed our flight, to go directly home,   27 other people also missed the same flight plus lots and lots of other flights.  We went to customer service,  American had nothing else to offer us, we were forced to spend over 300 per person to book another flight with Delta.  This poor woman had been working since 630 that morning (it was after 11pm).  Somehow, she reserved the seats but when we tried to check our bags and get boarding passes, at 330 am, we weren't in there.  We were told to leave the line and go downstairs somewhere back to American airlines to work with customer service. If we would have done that,  we would have missed that flight too. They eventually let us pay there instead.  Delta airlines did feel bad that our experience had been so bad at the airport and they did eventually get us home (we had to have another transfer in another city)  but eventually got there.",1
Very disfunctional and disorderly. First our gate was changed. Then we were told that two other flights are assigned to the same gate and they didn’t know when we would be able to take off. Our flight was 2.5 hours delayed and when all people bordered they realized all their ice melted and no trash container. Waited another 30 min for them to deliver ice and trash container. Ridiculous! We pay high dollars to fly and have to deal with this nonsense.,1
"Airlines are too far spread out with no clear messages to travelers of gate changes. When an airport is this large and the communication is anything less than stellar people get the short end of the stick and miss flights. Which cost wasted time, money, and effort. Number of other complaints but collectively getting transferring flights in the right location so you don't have to run through an airport should be one of the highest priorities of the staff. If people sat around all day and missed their flights they would be out of business eventually. Cleanliness is not on point either. Especially dealing with covid you would think efforts would be spent ensuring the areas where travellers have to go for one reason or another are cleaned. Many staff members were cleaning areas for employees but saw almost nothing for areas where the travellers have to wait. Including wiping down seats frequently, tables for computers, or the planes on transfer of Passengers. We boarded a plane less than 10 minutes after another flight leaving it. Either they have the world's fastest cleaners or the extreme & potentially dangerous shortcuts are being taken at the people paying the money trusting these mega businesses to keep them safe. If the demand due to covid, which is every company who fails to do their best is using, is too much to handle we shouldn't allow travel and the proper steps should be put in place to succeed at a high level. At the prices we pay for stateside flights you would expect the highest level. Something is wrong with the scenario across the board.",1
I'm not saying I hate the airport itself.  I'm saying I absolutely hate aa. Worst airline ever.  No matter what time day or night.  Aa airline will always screw it up. From January threw December.  Aa airline will create a reason to screw the flight up,1
"The signs to baggage claim sent me (us, other passengers) to E1. We were told that our luggage would be at E37. The baggage claim signs should have pointed us to our E37. It was a very long walk in the hot weather to get our bags.",1
"America Airlines was awful I will never in my entire life use that airline again. Worst experience ever. If I had to rate it correctly it would be a negative don't even deserve a star. We was delayed starting out, missed the next flight due to the delay, when getting re-booked was booked to go to a wrong destination, finally got that fixed, once made it to the destination over 16 hours later than actual arrival time my bags was not there all of them was left in Texas. I will never recommend using & I will never use again in my life.",1
"America airlines  at DWF airport cancelled our flight back home at the last minute. The costumer service was atrocious and abysmal. They were rude and obnoxious. We had to spend the night and catch a flight back home the next day as they changed our gait location 5 times before our flight home.  America airlines gave each of us a meal voucher for 12.00 dollars 1 for me and 1 12.00 meal voucher for my wife. That was pathetic because a bag of nuts costs 9.99 at the airport and a monster energy drink sells for 4.99.  I'll never ever, ever, ever use nor recommend American airlines.",1
I’ve flown in and out of here plenty of times. Besides airline workers being a holes sometimes my flights have always been delayed. I had to wait 30 min while already boarded and missed my connecting flight because Dfw was too crowded. All this land in Texas and they can’t have more gates.,1
"Have had layovers at this hub for years and it has always been good & efficient. June 13, 2022 was horrible! Ridiculous for the impact of summer travelers being in full force so the availibility of those passenger carts should be many and frequent during heavy traveler traffic. Once in Terminal A where I landed I waited almost an hour for one of those red passenger carts that take you between gates. I needed to get from Terminal A to my D gate. I cannot walk that distance nor able to get on and off the Skylink. My long wait was even with a kind stewardess calling for a cart, nothing. Worker ""Mehdi"" calling their supervisor to get a cart to the area in which I was waiting. Nothing. Speaking with another employee, nothing. Nearly an hour later I had to flag down a driver a visible distance away. I then had to ask the first driver 3 times to slow down! He was going much too fast and much too erratically. He then transferred me to another cart driver who took me a distance and transferred me to another one and then had my last cart driver. The next to last driver was very beligerent and argumentative and the last driver was late in coming, stopped to socialize with fellow employees(one who was socializing with him had the nerve to speak to me condenscendally telling me with pinched thumb and index finger ""just one more minute"" when I had politely expressed I needed to get to my gate. She was her own priority over passengers. In addition, that same driver would cuss throughout the trip when encountering the baffoon walking passengers who don't move out of the way when alerted. Nowhere does it say tipping is mandatory however when you debark from each cart, the drivers follow you a distance for a tip(looking for a handout like a bird wanting food). Some of us who need to take those passenger carts are on limited income. But if there was extra to give for a tip, I should be the one deciding if a tip is necessary without being followed like a duckling. I have also witnessed a ""team"" of cart drivers who are buddies have a gig set up where they extend the #of cart drivers to get a tipping passenger on the carts of each one in the gig and they communicate and alert said driver that they are bringing that passenger to them. The drivers ""surprisingly"" and conveniently meetup afterward and visibly count their tip total.
In various online reviews  I have read, DFW claims they are having difficulty hiring drivers for these passenger carts. Then prepare ahead and successfully because you knew summer was going to open up ""post-pandemic"" and be heavily traveled! Also, do much better at the training of those cart drivers in providing much safer passenger transportation between gates and remind them they work for the passengers for FREE. Instead of all but begging for a tip, a plastic jar could be affixed to the front, near where the driver stands and those who want to tip can do so OPTIONALLY without being asked to. There is beyond ZERO excuse for what I had to go through!!!!!",1
"First time having layover at this place and it sucks. This is the most disgusting airport I've ever been to. The restrooms are atrocious, a long with all the seating by the gates. Get your Clorox wipes out folks, it's necessary",1
How long would the trip be to use SWA into Love and then DART over to the  TEXrail? American Airlines is making predictable travel for business impossible compared to their competition.,1
Overly bizzy Overly expensive to many Overly entitled people I'm loosing faith in mankind this place shows it,1
"Everytime I fly out this airport my flight is getting delayed for some stupid reason. Everytime, cannot wait to move cities so I don’t have to depend on this airport. Not to mention its more filthy than average",1
"Never have I been treated so rudely in an airport before. The incompetent staff will take out their anger at having to do a job at you randomly. This very obese, very balding man in an ill fitting suit walks around customs yelling at minorities. Sickens me.",1
"This airport is very poorly run. It took 50 minutes to get to our gate after landing because they are an unorganized mess. So once you get off of your plane, you are in a hurry to get to the train, but the escalator to the train doesn't work, so you have to carry your bags up three flights of stairs to get to the train...while wearing a mask. And most of the restaurants close at 7:30 PM even though flights continue to come and go throughout the night. It is a Tuesday night, so it is not like these problems are occurring during the weekend rush. This airport is poorly run.",1
"Every time I am here, my flights are delayed or canceled. The communication is horrible and the attendants at the gate are unfriendly and unhelpful at best. I get it that things happen sometimes, but to have my flights messed with EVERY TIME I'm here is ridiculous. I've never had so much trouble with an airport. The cleanliness is also lacking. Trash is usually all over the seats",1
Horrible service. Made my mother miss her plane twice. She was stuck over 30 hrs in the airport with no compensation or anything for something that was their fault. We will be sticking to Delta airports. Never had an issue with Delta.,1
"Hated it! Place is the WallMart of Airports. Customs had 36 lanes they could have used... But only 6 agents working.... TSA had nothing but attitude..... Terminal D is 82KM long, maybe Idk, and D3 to D37 is a hike and a half.

Less than one star review.",1
Our flight landed from London. A hatch door wouldn't open on the aircraft causing us to miss our connecting flight. Airline announced they would have tables set up to help us get to where we needed to go. Never saw the tables. We didn't know where to go do we just had to figure all that out for ourselves. We had a toddler with us that we had to find milk for. They booked us on a flight as standby. That flight was overbooked. Got a ticket for the next flight out. Got to the destination airport 5 hours later than planned.,1
"Terrible, trying to get to Mom's funeral and layover is only 45 minutes , we get to gate late by few minutes, plus they change gate we land at so have to go all the way around on train to get there. I get to gate and even though plane is still there and tell them need to make that plane or will miss my mom's funeral, the door is closed and they aren't going to open for nothing. Not sure ever fly American again.",1
"Worst airport in the whole entire world. Delayed flights, low personnel, long lines. Not organized at all. Flew by here a couple of times and hated it. Never flying through Dallas again.",1
"This airport feels like it has less rights than other airports in other states, especially - and oddly - on Sundays.

Oh, and it's a nightmare to navigate in a timely manner.",1
Terrible. The only good thing about it was that it wasn't Atlanta. Do not ever want to use this airport again.,1
"My girlfriend has a brain injury. So she is horrible at directions and understanding where she is at times. Becomes disoriented and due to lack of emotional control can get very frustrated. Now instead of helping her, they began harassing her and made her miss her flight. Leaving her stuck for the next flight 2 hours later.
All I can really say is... what? How do you not notice a huge scar on someone's forehead, put 2 and 2 together. That maybe this person has a mental handicap. Nah. It's get mad and interrogate the hell out of em",1
Team of female thieves stole my backpack off the shuttles between terminals,1
"Horrid airport. Just sprawls & sprawls. No signage to tell you where to go. The kiosk gave me the wrong gate for my flight when I scanned my boarding pass, and that gate was so difficult to find I was convinced it only existed in another dimension. Then I figured out the correct gate (because that one was closed) and had to trek about a mile to find the correct gate. The women's restrooms are hidden and the signs are only visible from head on, so if you're slightly to the left or right of the door, you can't see the sign at all. Horribly designed airport.",1
"Came through here in transit for 4 hours on my way to somewhere beautiful and warm. Wasn’t expecting much but I was expecting COWBOYS and let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, it was a big disappointment. A few passing oddballs wearing a cowboy hat is not the real deal… a monkey in dress is a monkey no less. Next time I’m going to transit where the real COWBOYS are",1
"Extremely terrible experience. We arrived with the intent to catch a connecting flight. The Skylink service was down and we exited the airport in order to switch terminals. There were VERY few shuttles and no direction whatsoever on what to do, we had to catch and Uber to reach the other terminal! We JUST caught our connecting flight. The most helpful employee was a TSA lady who probably was the reason we didn't miss our flight. Completely unacceptable.",1
Worst airport ever . Bad service and very racist airport. No help at all . They even demand tips when you ask them where are the gates . It’s really sad how they hire people like this . Not to mention I lost a bag there which it had a value of 60$ of gift stuff I got my family . I lost it in 2 revision because the guy checking our bags stop the machine and my stuff didn’t come all out . I didn’t realize once I was in my gate . I went to their website to see a lost and found and guess what. They charge a 40$ fee to process it . Might as well loose the package . Very unprofessional,1
"Literally almost missed our connecting flight because the busses took too long. Literally the driver pulled away then went back to the same terminal to change shift while the whole bus was filled. Had to wait for the change of driver, and why are the terminals so far apart? Then we get to our right location and they closed TSA down early so we have to run to the next tsa point which closed in 5 minutes and there was a new person training that took forever, which then we had to run because our gate was the farthest to the right! Just from this experience we will never go to Texas. When it takes an hour and a half to get to your gate theres something wrong",1
"Some terminals are spacious and beautiful, some old. Some bathrooms need updating. Ground transportation is Horrible; fragmented with Too many different types of busses and rail lines, and Too many different locations to catch them. One might depart from one terminal and return to a different terminal. On site Skytrain is only on the secure side, while busses are on the non-secure side. One heavy rail line serves Tarrant County from one terminal, while a light rail serves Dallas County from a different terminal. Buses to transport one between terminals are upstairs, while other busses (rental, remote parking, employee parking) are downstairs. It is a nightmare for infrequent travellers. We were downstairs to catch an employee parking bus to get a free ride, we had to transport luggage back upstairs to catch bus to transfer terminals, then walk downstairs with luggage to catch bus to employee lot. All the while we passed several different bus stops (several airline gates disyance) which served different lots or services such as car rental.",1
"The airport was nice. The airlines told us when we got to Dallas we would have vouchers for motels and food. They did not. Only a few got the vouchers...maybe 15. And they said save your receipts, maybe the airline will reimburse you....That is a bad way to.treat your customers when due to the flight being delayed from Alberquerie to Dallas we missed our connecting flight. AMERICAN AIRLINES YOU OWE YOUR CUSTOMERS SOME MONEY.
My husband and I are on a tight budget and we really could not afford a room for the night but it was either that or sleep on the airport floor. We are not young people and thought it would be so hard on us.
So think.twice before you trust any airline.",1
"Within my 20 min layover, between 2 gates, my wife's ankle was bruised by an employee pulling a trolly with a single empty bin on it. When asked to apologize, he just gave her a look and said ""sorry your wife wasn't walking fast enough""!!! Like we aren't rushing due to bad airport logistics. Then another employee as a chashier had the audacity to wave his hand at my face telling me to hurry up over n over while he wasn't doing his end and clearly didn't know how to work his station. Finally a flight attendant who was warned with a ""watch out"" as luggage fell, berated a passenger and threatened to bar them from the plane only to go on and talk trash about said passenger to a different section of the plane and other employees instigating further arguments with other flight attendants. Worst airport ever. AVOID! Other than that, Texans need to wash themselves more if at all.",1
"The employees here were absolutely the rudest. We were told NOT to take anything out of our bags. When we put our bags on the belt to be scanned, they asked if we had any electronics and we did, a Kindle. So they yelled at us to take it out and when I was clearly annoyed by this, two female employees started mocking me saying, “Oh, I’m American, I don’t HAVE to take anything out of my bag.” First of all, I never said anything about being an entitled American. Secondly, I tried to take my stuff out of my bag to begin with and they told me not to. Get your rules together and get your employees on the same page.
Also, riding on the Skylink— make sure you’re holding on. It would almost slam to a stop and then jolt forward when going.",1
"Very long security check on Friday, expect at least 45 min waiting time",1
I know not all TSA agents are rude but I encountered 2 flying today that were rude and so unpleasant I would like to never go back to Dallas. One was directing us to another check point and would not explain what was going on I was very confused. And the other was at the belt were we put out bags to be scanned as I was taking my laptop out he just kept saying no no no with no communication as to what he meant and when I ask what he meant he said I am not going to say no again to what you are doing and I always am told to take out my laptop so I am not happy with these two men who has no sense of what customer service is or has basic kindergarten verbal skills so upset with these officers and want to see action taken on them because I thought Dallas had better communication skills than what I saw today! Sorry to all the decent TSA officers out there but these 2 are bragging you down and making your job harder.,1
"Worst terminal transit system I know of. If you arrive here then you don't get to use the sky link and have to go stand in the heat waiting for 1 bus that will take you to terminal B.

Terminal link bus from D to B took 27 minutes. 13 minutes waiting for the bus to arrive and then so full that everyone couldn't get on so they had to wait another 13 minutes.

And, they don't take you to the train. Dump you off at a terminal and you get to walk in Texas heat for a long time.

Train is great but DFW does everything they can do to keep you from riding it.",1
"The worst airport we've ever been to. Your flights keep getting moved to different gates which requires you to keep boarding the sky shuttle and go back and forth. Many people missed their flights due to this. We missed one of our flights due to a combination of that and waiting over 15 minutes, once we had already cleared immigration and customs to get our luggage. Then we had to take our luggage to another area to be put on our transfer plane, plus you had to go through the check in process again. Employees are not friendly either.",1
It's too big! When our plane landed it taxied 15 min.When you walk off the plane you are lost. Then you walk and walk to get to rental pick up. Then long ride to rental cars. People are not intrested in helping you. It needs to be half the size it is. Build two or three smaller air ports. Love field is the best size to get around in.,1
"This airport. Welcome to amateur hour. We were bumped from terminal to terminal 5 times in as many hours because our AA flight was continually delayed. They finally put us in a plane then after waiting 45 minutes, they cancelled the flight. Wait it get worse. If we wanted to speak to a help desk or rebooking agent, we need to walk another 10 gates down. Horrible airport. Go to Houston or Hobbie before coming to DFW.",1
"Zero customer service from the hall reps in the customs hall -they were rude to a number of people who were trying to ask for information, touching people as they were herding them into queues ,no face masks worn, very disorganised and spoke little or limited English.
An international  transit system that was complete chaos,archaic  and caused many European travellers to miss interconnecting flights - whats happened to customer service that the USA is so proud of?
This airport needs to learn a few lessons from its counterparts on what good looks like.
Lastly we had a customs guard who told me not to walk the way I was walking - seeing as I had an infection in my heel and a lot of pain , it was the only way I could walk !- thank god I wasn't suffering from a disabilty that effected my walking as this bigoted remark may have caused even more offence, unnecessary judgement and distress.",1
Terrible wait time. TSA has had this lane stalled for 15 mins….. no sense of urgency. Didn’t open another lane. (which I’ve seen other airports do) We’re literally stuck while passengers way behind us move ahead. It’s infuriating…. Praying I don’t miss my flight,1
"On 6/5/2023 TLH to Dallas Ft Worth was late, but stewardess seen us 100 feet from door to make our flight to Dublin and she shut it. There excuse was, ""We've been calling you."" They seemed amused that our travel plans were ruined.",1
Worst airport ever! I had connection flights both in my inbound and outbound trip to Los Cabos. All restaurants and stores close early (at 6pm) so there is absolutely nothing to do if you have a late connection flight (I had 10 hour layover from 8pm to 6am. The American Airline land crew is the meanest I have ever experienced. They were rude and discriminating. Avoid by any mean!  #DFW #AmericanAirline,1
"It was a nightmare for international flights. There were a lot of people waiting to be accepted into United States and few officers... Men from pushing a wheel chairs or driving a special cars in the hallways  of the airport are expecting a tip.  if someone doesn't bring money. They're asking to withdraw the money from ATM...I told one of this staff no I don't want withdraw money, then he did not give me a ride to my gate I had to walk. Also you have to wait for the service every 5 minutes they change the driver because there was not enough staff to help.",1
"Get here really early if you've never been here before, layout is not intuitive  or labeled other than terminals. GPS will own take you the wrong way since a lot of roads are closed. Turn tolls on for gps, it'll save you lots of time and headache",1
"This is the second worst airport I have ever been to. The people are awful. You know it took me talking to
12 different people just to find out during my one day lay over I cant get my ticket until midnight for international. Do you guys not communicate at all. I mean if I had know this prior maybe I would have gotten a hotel well before my flight. And I love how your employees just pass you from person to the next when someone is in need of help. And even after telling them I was military in need of help, again nothing. Will pay extra to not have to fly thru here next time.",1
We landed and waited near 2 hours to get off the plane. Not enough space to unload the plane and no buses to take us to terminal. Went from 30 mins to 2 hour wait,1
"There is no separate line fir pre check. We gave to show 4 times that we are pre check. The phone was placed in the tray. Now how can I show the agent that I am pre check?.  She had to call another agent, delay , lucky I was able to make it to the flight.",1
"Purgatory. I’ve been stuck here for over 24 hours due to lack of pilots, lack of planes lack of crackers and cookies. If you like changing gates at a moments notice and waiting on hot planes for several hours only to wait to taxi for another hour as well as miss all connecting flights, this is your go to location!!!",1
"Oh boy. This airport really sucks. No hub and spoke, just linear with a steady stream of late gate changes that will surely throw you onto the wretched skylink and into travel anxiety. Yuck. Second only to Heathrow in terms of time commitment.",1
"If ""avoid tolls"" is selected, Google maps can not navigate to Terminal C. It also does not say ”unable to navigate there with ""avoid tolls"" selected. It tries to make you enter Airport only staff gate.

DFW airport good. Google maps fail.",1
"The security checkpoints make no sense for international incoming flights. Get off a plane to go back through a security checkpoint just to have most people around us missing their flights due to missed connections. Staff was not helpful at all. Did not prioritze those that had connecting flights sending them back to the back of the line. I understand how absolutely insanely busy the travel industry is but feel there is no excuse for some of the things that occured. I've flown out of most major airports and after 33 years of travel this just was embarrassing. At one point I saw a big stack of cash and an abandoned bag and informed a few TSA agents. They said, ""so what? Somebody's elses problem that left it."" I thought that was a totally inappropriate response especially when we try to instill a mentality of ""if you see something say aomething."" I told both agents that and they just laughed and carried on. Pretty embarassing to come back to the states and be treated like this by our own fellow citizens herethat are to help make our travels safe and smooth. Definitely need to spend some time retraining or reprioritizing because next time I see something in Dallas I probably won't say something.",1
"Multiple issues happens all the time, flight delay, airplane issues, and today, even the door has issue. And nobody able to fix the door, the alarm runs for about the 15 minutes, and the agent tried so many times, but it just won't shut down. It's so loud! Plus the the airplane have some problems, but they just can notice before we boarding, so we are stuck on the flight for an hour, it's so hot, then the maintenance guy finally arrive. Then they send us back to the lobby again, and I still don't know how much longer we need to wait. And I giving the rate for one start for a fair good reason. On the boarding lobby, there are at least 3 flight delay for different reasons.
And before today's experience, I had once that we are delay for 2 hour while we wait in the airplane, the reason is because of food! Omg, cause in DFW you change boarding gate all the time, and on that time, the tower forgot to inform the stuff, the stuff wait for a long time without information, so they thought the flight is cancelled, then somehow the food that prepared for us is been eaten. So I guess they prepared another one for us. And the whole thing takes almost 2 hour to solve it.",1
Did not like the airport majority of the people did not speak or understand English I am visually impaired and I needed wheelchair assistance the whole time they picked me up and just dropped me off at the next gate and just left me I had to rely on the goodness of other people sitting around me to get the help that I needed if I can totally bypass that airport I will!,1
"I had the WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD ANYWHERE IN THIS AIRPORT , if you can avoid coming here do it. Every person I spoke to regarding me needing wheelchair assistance either didn’t get it or rolled their eyes and was annoyed with actually needing to help a customer. I just had surgery so I can walked very far nor carry heavy bags . Not only was everyone rude I missed my flight because they couldn’t get me the assistance I needed. I was there for 4 hours before me flight as well. PATHETIC",1
DFW Airport is always a good reminder of just how bad an airport can be while being sure to charge you the maximum every time.,1
I will absolutely try to avoid this airport in the future. I am handicapped and required a wheelchair escourt from gate to gate. On my first flight through there the escourt was not there. I had to talk to a gate worker.,1
"No wheelchair assistance available even though it was requested in advance. Both elevators to Terminal B are broken. Very difficult to get to the gate with a broken ankle. Think they may have been a little overwhelmed, there were 6 people on my plane that needed wheelchair assistance.",1
TSA was awful tonight.  They clearly weren’t prepared for multiple international flights.  It took well over an hour to get through security.  Absolutely awful government inefficiency.,1
Walked from gate C-11 to C-19 and then C-19 to C-7 to find one working water fountain. Out of the 6 I found on one is working. Also the gate chairs with power to charge have no power. Being this is an American Airlines terminal it's about what you can expect when dealing with AA and anything associated with AA.,1
"Literally worst experience I’ve ever had at an airport. The employees here are extremely rude and not helpful. I tried asking two employees for help on where to find the check in for my airline and they responded “sorry we’re busy working.” Like is that not part of your job? Other people were just as shocked as I was when they responded this way. Do better, if you don’t like your job go somewhere else! You guys deal with hundreds of people per day I cannot believe you treat people this way and that this is allowed.",1
"I have a sprained ankle. I came in from another state. They ignore those that need handicapped assistance. People sit in handicapped areas and nobody cares. They dropped me off at the bathroom, left and I had to swing on crutches to my gate. Anyone ever on crutches - yeah try and go 6 or 7 gates. Sitting at the gate- no hello or service from AMERICAN AIRLINES.  Yeah. I’ve been on united and even in 3rd world countries. They all serve handicapped.
AMERICAN doesn’t seem to care that you have a cast and crutches. They ignore
So anyone thinking about traveling who needs assistance. Be aware of this airport and AMERICAN
PLUS they gave me a seat at the back of the plane…another walking issue.",1
"The literal worst airport of all time. EVERY SINGLE TIME I fly here, they are ALWAYS late, they ALWAYS lose/forget my bag. This place is absolutely terrible.",1
"Ask your security staff to stop yelling at passengers as they struggle to remove shoes, belts, & jackets, place all before-mentioned items and devices in the plastic tubs, place plastic tubs & heavy carry-ons onto conveyor belt.  Yelling only heightens the anxiety and frustration of your paying passengers.  It is also demeaning and, of course, unnecessary.  Everyone knows the drill and deserves your respect.  We are not cattle; we are paying customers.  I give your security staff a failing grade of D-.",1
Be sure to scan your ticket half an hour before departure because sometimes they will change the original waiting room to another. I lost my flight due to this inconvenience and noone has told me about this. They have panels on the wall to verify your flight.,1
"American Airlines.....I am recovering after  the  hip surgery. Needed to fly, so ordered special assistance.  Arrived to the airport earlier. With no problems was assisted to the gate. Since baording hasn't started yet, the assistant left me at the gate. I was told, when boarding will start, someone will assist me further to the plain.  Never happened . Had to walk through the sleeve, slowing others down.. Very dissatisfied. ...",1
"We transferred from a flight from Mexico. Security officers at this location were rude, and often gave directly contradictory instructions. One told us to take our liquids out of our bag, then we were chastised for opening the bag to do so. We were told not to put our boarding pass into our passports, and then told to go back in line for not having our boarding passes with our passports. All our baggage was re-checked at the same time from our connection, but 3 of our bags didn't make it onto the flight.

Maybe this should be on a review on the TSA as an institution, maybe they're aiming to make everyone afraid so no one tries anything. But anyway, from here on I will make every effort to avoid having to connect in this airport.",1
Terrible airport. 5hr delay because the airport can't do routine maintence on the planes. Plane sat in the hangar being fixed the whole time. Will not return to this airport ever.,1
"Spent more than an hour waiting for fuel with plane boarded, almost as long as our flight.  Really disorganized group",1
"This is by far my least favorite airport on the States. Gates are all over the place, the buses/rails never drop me off where I need to go, maybe that's my fault but its confusing none the less. I have been to many airports and never have as difficult of a time as I do here. 95% of my flights to and from DFW have been delayed. Restaurants in all gates but D are trash. Maybe try Dallas Love, that port is a little less annoying.",1
"The place is beautiful, big, clean, efficient and well connected. The people in charge however, not very efficient. Spect long, LONG lines for almost everything, specially homeland (in) & security (out) are a joke! Make sure you arrive VERY early and to have EXTRA time to spare between flights.",1
"Used to be a good airport. It is now a full scale zoo like a new york airport. Disorganized, the staff wonders around, even though there are huge crowds. In addition, no accomodations for travelers with children. Make sure you get there good 2 hours ahead even for domestic flights. They do not care.",1
I've been to airports in 3rd world countries that are operated better than this dump. Every connecting flight I've ever had at DFW has either been delayed or canceled.,1
The plane windshield  heater didn't  work and it was rain in Houston where the plane was headed so we had to get off the plane and wait for another one to arrive  and its just a total debacle,1
Worst experience ive had with a 4 hour delay on American waiting for a 40 min flight.   Pilot issues then plane too hot.  Ridiculous.  So glad i will get in my hotel just a few hours before a huge meeting in the am.,1
"Needed wheel chair
and they had no one
but an 80 year old man. He had to push 5 people  because he was working alone. Went to board train and it stopped working. Almost missed my connecting flight.
Dallas-Fort airport is pathetic,just like their football team
Avoid it if you can",1
"Literally the most confusing and poorly organised airport I have been to when trying to do a transfer from an international to a domestic flight... And I have been through airports in Syria! Massive lines, few immigration agents, I am not clear what the point of the passport machines are if you then have to wait in a huge and chaotic line.  Maybe it's good if you are just flying out of here but AVOID at all costs for transfers ... It took me 1.5 hours and I would have missed my connecting flight if some people hadn't let me go in front of them.",1
"If you have physical limitations and require assistance, this is not the airport for you!  Help is slow to come. When they do come to pick you up  they drive so fast,  you are in danger of falling off. The passenger transport cart has no seat belts.",1
"I was booked on a flight from Milwaukee, WI on July 5th. Flying on American Airline to Phoenix, Az. Laying over in Dallas/Fort Worth for 2 hrs, then continuing to Phoenix at 9:01pm for a 23 minute flight to Phoenix at 9:24pm. I was picked up by a airport representative from the door of the airplane with a needed assistance a ""wheelchair"" because I have a bullet in my back and I was scheduled for ""Surgery"" on the morning of the 6th at 10:00am. The representative looks at my ticket and ""Chinese"" culture and says ""you go to Gate 20."" I sit in the chair, we take off to the ""Gate 20"" area. It is now the morning of the ""6th."" I am still at Dallas Airport because no one working with American Airline informed me that the ""Gate"" was changed to ""D20"" which is on the far end of the Airport. There was 50 people inconvenienced and put in Hotels that needed to be on a plane on our way to the end of our trip destination. Surgery did not happen when it was scheduled because I am still in Dallas Airport now at 06:30am on standby for a flight at 08:30am. Praying that I get on this one. Horrible situation, and condition to put the passengers through.",1
"For those who travel often,you know the ghetto side of this airport,just getting worse
And ygly trash, broken equipment etc ghetto side where there's hardly any restaurant just food machines and a ghetto hamburguesa place",1
"My boyfriends flight has been changed 3 times, gate changed multiple times and he’s been stuck there for over 5 hours. Called to get an update and they said it was due to bad weather which isn’t even existent anymore. He said it backed up things but my boyfriend was sitting in his seat with the plane ready to take off when they asked everyone to get off again. The person whom answered the phone was rude and sarcastic. Said I needed to contact the airline to see what was going on but didn’t you just say it was due to bad weather? I told him he was terrible at customer service and he sarcastically said “thank you!”
This airport doesn’t care about updating their customers or offering any type of support/help",1
"I booked a flight on American Airlines today. The fight was for 313pm, flight 2065. I arrived at 1pm. It is now 1020pm. I have walked 8.7 miles today as I ran from terminal to terminal to try and leave on another flight to Salt Lake City. At one point we actually completely boarded a plane and then the flight was cancelled. Between broken down planes and no crews DFW for AA has been a no fly zone.",1
"Arriving:Terrible experience. Rude staff, no communication between departments, too much to list. It was just overall the worst airport experience.
Departing: American Airline staff acted very irritated from doing her job. Those asking questions about the confusing check-in system were all victims to her attitude. I flew from 4 different airports in the past month. Each one had a different procedure for checking weapons. DFW treated me like I was stupid for not knowing their procedures. Completely disappointed.  I will route all my employees and my family trips to avoid DFW from now on.",1
"Was at the airport June 20, 2022 for a layover from Europe.  This was the worst kept airport I've seen.  Multiple broken stalls in bathrooms in Multiple restrooms.  Sinks are in shameful disrepair.  I don't think most Americans are aware of how far behind we are from the rest of the world on infrastructure. Bad look for Dallas.",1
"This place needs levelled and rebuilt from scratch!  There is no finding arrivals unless you are a local and have learned the secret unmarked access route s... and good luck finding your way out.  Bad, narrow roads to boot.  Did I mention no markings and speed traps?  Unbelievable, but does help with keeping my vulgar obscenities performance up to snuff!  Avoid this place like the plague.",1
Absolutely the worst rental car shuttle situation of any airport I fly through. No ques for shuttles so people just jump on with no regard for who's been waiting. Would it be so hard to paint some lanes on the ground or put in some ropes?,1
DFW need to watch the international flights and put enough workers in the customs and security lines.  2 times in 9 days we missed flights because of poor planning/scheduling on their part.  Plenty of time scheduled for layover to accommodate this process if the airport planned their workers better,1
Hire more people to clean the disgusting bathrooms. Seeing that we are in a pandemic you would think cleanliness would be a too concern but it seems that it is the lowest concern. They are worse than a truck stop bathroom. That is my only complaint the layout and ease of commuting is superb.,1
Apparently this airport can’t handle an inch of snow pretty much shut the airport down. People sitting on the ground all over. My own flight was rescheduled at least 10 times literally. Hate Dallas hate the Cowboys. Keep your bbq it’s better down south anyway.,1
"Extremely Poor Experience at Falls/Fort Worth Airport.

The TSA staff have very negative attitudes. With the exception of one gentleman, all were but we'll informed, could care less about performing their jobs properly or how to communicate.

Why anyone would want to fly of they don't have to is behind me.",1
worst airport design i have ever encountered. we got lost multiple times just dropping my sister off at the airport. you have to pay a toll just to enter airport grounds. the roads are confusing and the buildings are laid out so strangely. i hate this airport.,1
"We booked an intl flight (China eastern) and arrived 2hr30’ early. The ticket said gate E16 and when we got there, we couldn’t find the check in desk. So we showed the flight itinerary to the staff who was directing people to their location and asked for direction, he pointed us to American airline check in desk. We were confused as to the ticket was showing China eastern so we asked again to make sure but he said that flight is monitored by American airline. So we ran over to American airline check in desk, and they said it’s not the right place, and directed us over to Alaska airline. We ran over to Alaska airline check in desk, showed them the itinerary and 1 lady said “I have no idea what airline this is” and said to check with Delta airline. So we ran over to Delta and there’s this super long line but there’s nobody directing or helping passengers, only check in staffs behind the desk. So we had to wait in line. After an hour of waiting in line, we were told that we should be in the other line - the special service line - which if were told, would save us an hour of waiting time because that line had like 10 people. So we had to get over to special service line and get in line again. By the time we got to check in desk, we’ve missed our boarding time. So they told us we have to rebook with China eastern airline. After a lengthy conversation on the phone they said we have to pay $700 for the next day flight. We were speechless. That was our only option. So no, I DO NOT recommend this airport. The staffs don’t know anything, no one helps you, and the gate/check in location is all over the place.",1
"Rudest airport staff I've ever met and I fly A LOT. The customs line was backing up so they literally just started letting everyone through???? Like, taking our piece of paper without looking at us, no questions, just straight through. SURELY that's not how our national boarder patrol is supposed to work.

Once we made it to security, the guy scanning bags put almost EVERY bag in the ""extra security"" line, but there was NO ONE looking through bags for extra security. Once someone did come over and start looking through bags, a manager came over and called them away. Took my family 20 minutes for their bags to be ""looked"" at and given back.

We had 2 hours between our flights, yet we just about missed it because security was slow and did not give a flying f*** that people had places to be.",1
Waited 40 min on flight delay for a crew to show up from another flight. Boarded late only to find out the plane which was ready had mechanical issues. Sat on plane at gate almost 2 hrs to be cancelled. No hotel vouchers left for overnight stay.,1
Late plane South Express parking dispatch didn't send a shuttle for nearly 1hour after calling 4 times they finally got a shuttle to us. Flight landed at 100am didn't get picked up until after 2am,1
Thanks to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection we lose our flight connection. We spend 2 hours waiting in the line. The staff didn't help us. Nice way treating tourists. Now we must wait 7 hours for our next flight and of course our plans for today were ruined!,1
"Gate changed 4 times, departure time changed 4 times. Had to run back and forth too many times. I have sciatica and is 66 yoa and that was TOO DAMNED much running back and forth from one end of the airport to the other. Now my back is killing me and I can't stand up straight. Flight was fine.",1
Worst travel experience ever… and that is saying a lot. 4 gate changes 3 airplanes … cherry on the Sundae - crew timed out at 11:30 pm … no way to reschedule… first flight of the morning delayed too because… wait for it … they didn’t schedule a first officer for the flight,1
"I travel for business regularly and DFW just keeps getting worse and worse. Delays, delays, delays, last minute gate changes, and rude gate staff. I try to avoid DFW as much as possible, but since it is one of the largest American Airline hubs.... they have you stuck. American Airlines prices have not dropped, but they fly smaller planes that are more crowded and force you to check, exaggerating an already bad situation.",1
Not happy with wait to Ft. Wayne last night! Seemed no one knew what was going on. Departure time changed 5 times then a change of gate was difficult with a handicap husband. Probably won't be flying again. We have for years and never had such problems before.,1
"Easy to navigate through this airport, but if you're looking for something to eat after 8pm, I hope you packed your dinner or are ok with vending food because that's about all you're going to get. You would think that TGIF or any of their sports bars would be open, Whataburger, Wendy's all closed.",1
Arrived over two hours early for a direct flight and our luggage still didn't make the trip... after a 30 minute tsa pre check line wait the entire airport experience was pretty rough...,1
"This place is easily the most disgusting airport I've been to, and a hotspot for COVID. With so many ""freedumb"" shouters, at least 70% of patrons walking are wearing chin diapers, mesh masks, or straight not wearing a mask at all, and none of that counts for every person at the restaurants not wearing a mask. It comes with extreme disappointed that the tax dollars of the everyday citizen of this country goes to TSA, which has done nothing nothing to stop these biological weapon spreaders. With the lack of their initiative in keeping the population safe, it's almost like the USA is paying these individuals for intentionally spreading diseases. Honestly, this place needs to be federally shut down for the blatant disregard of human safety.

If given a layover here or flight it's best to reconsider. Nothing like a group of people screaming about freedom when simple leisures are still against the law here.",1
"Never have I ever had this much indecent and disrespectful service while attempting to board my flight.. I have wasted half my day in this airport, being told different things and where to go only to be stuck in Dallas. No eye contact, poor attention and now being told I am wrong for something I made sure over the phone was correct.. hours later. Livid!!!! Extremely upset with the way me and my friend have been treated all day.",1
I thought JFK airport was bad but this place us worse!!! Moment I stepped off the plane I go to the information booth and there's this elderly lady kicked back with her feet on the desk on her phone and when I try asking for help she's gives me a finger tell me to wait. I have to ask again excuse me ma'am and she gives me a dirty look as I disrupted her slumber. Customer service is absolutely terrible and not a welcoming or hospitable place.,1
"Worse Immigration entry point  ...never has enough staff to get passengers through thoroughly or promptly. Have waited in lines between 30 to 90mins. If you have a connecting flight make sure there is a min 3 hour layover,  you still have to go through customs, TSA security,  and skylink train to the connecting flight. If you are waiting for family members to get through, there are no bathrooms in the waiting hallway. Other than the Immigration the rest of the airport is clean and the staff is friendly.",1
"Used to live and fly out of DFW a lot, this trip through DFW was terrible. Came from Cabo, had to go through customs...1.5 hours to get asked if I had plants or tabacco, then grab my checked bag, give it back to American and go through security all over again. Wow, barely made our connection and airport folks were tired and overworked so no compassion or concern - which really fried my bride. Maybe try Atlanta or a different airport if you don't have time.",1
"No communication skills at all. Had to stay all night in the airport with nothing offered after we got here from Odessa trying to get to Cleveland. Odessa plane was 10 minutes late. We had to run all the way across the airport only for the lady to tell us we couldn't board, even though we had our tickets and the Cleveland plane was still there. So ridiculous and uncomfortable. Also, almost no one at this airport speaks English to help anyone. Will never travel to DFW again.",1
"I visited this airport on May 11th and was on stand by because I had to find another flight after missing it due to a delay from floods. Upon approaching the front desk A11 for American Airlines at approximately 4:50, I asked the lady at the computer a question about my flight and in her words and making it clear she was very annoying  “I was at the wrong gate, and I wasn’t her problem, and if I didn’t get my my gate, she was going to put me on the “no board” list”. I was completely shocked and taken back so I walked away in tears and relayed what happened to my significant other and a pilot has overheard our conversation and encouraged us to write American Airlines and let them know what had happened because he also agreed this was not okay. I have been in and out of DIA in Denver and have always been treated very kindly no matter the question, and they have WAY more to deal with on a day to day basis. I am completely disgusted with the way the staff treats paying customers and I will make it a priority to never visit this facility again!",1
"The worst experience of my life...never, ever fly into Dallas if you can help it!!  Especially if you have a disability!!!  Requested wheel chairs for my son and I weeks ago. Needless to say they did not accommodate us.  Had to wait 45 minutes and then they pushed us to our next gate, left us there and no bathroom for us, no food.  Finally a stewardess helped us.  Will never fly American again!!!!",1
"My luggage was lost and there was no remorse whatsoever.

There was horrible customer service. No one seemed to care.

During this time you would think there would be some empathy. But there was not.

My father in law passed and I am meeting the family. With nothing to wear.

So. So. Unacceptable.",1
"When I arrive from Mexico to Dallas,I got a Link orange shudle, I tip the driver 10 dollars,I didn't have change for a 100 dollar bill, I told him to take 10 dollars, but he took 35, my flight was also delayed 4 times, they were supposed to get me a hotel room but I ended up staying at the airport",1
"When I arrived at DFW, I went to use the men's restroom outside of the TSA area. The floor around the toilets was flooded with a large puddle of water and smelled of urine upon walking through the entrance.

In addition, 4 out of 5 employees I spoke to at the airport were short with me and seemed disinterested in assisting me. I simply asked basic questions about my gate number, my boarding pass, and at the bagel shop: WHAT BREAD MY SANDWICH COMES ON. Being polite is basic, y'all.

UPDATE: After 3 more flights from DFW....
-  Expect for only one TSA line to be open and move at a slug pace.
- Expect non-crew employees to cut the line in front of you (four cut in front of me)",1
"The airport is nice, but everything seems her disorganized. Signs for security checks say a check opens at 3:30... but it doesn't. TSA agents say there are busses, but they don't start service until 5:00. Just unorganized and not overly friendly.",1
"Worst airport ever
Never ever ever fly from their",1
"Avoid DFW at all costs. Forced to fly American instead of Southwest and missed flight despite arriving 3 hours early. TSA was great but stewards ""decided"" a different security checkpoint had more than the 20 people at her gate so she closed access forcing several hundred to a single funnel resulting in an hour long security debacle. Couple that with ""systems malfunctions"" at the American desk resulting in an hour and a half delay checking in and all in all very poor customer experience.....  save yourself the trouble and fly Southwest out of Love field.",1
"This is the worst airport. I wouldn’t wish departure at this airport on anybody. Not a single associate knew what was going on, the line of command is out of order, hold times/wait times are ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and go to any of the other airports to save time and money",1
"I have yet to go through this airport on any airline where DFW didn't have 3 or 4 gate changes, poor organization, and tons of delayed flights. Largest airport in the world with neutral emissions. Can't get a flight out on time to save their life.",1
The airport is so big that you get confused and lost if you don't know your way around.  TSA checkpoints are totally a mess. There is no communication between the employees and you have 2 or 3 people telling you where and what to do. I didn't like it at all,1
"Stopover at DFW two days ago and the jet bridge was broken.  Sat for over 30 minutes before they towed us to another gate.  Going through again today on the way home.  They started boarding my flight and stopped because...you guessed it, the jet bridge is broken.  Maybe they need a new maintenance supervisor.",1
"Two things
1. Baggage claim to 45 minutes before bags even started coming.
2. Terminal Link spots need signage to explain that people have to call past midnight to get service. There is nothing at terminal C thats says this.",1
Stuck at airplane one and half hour due to no enough gate to receive. Ridiculous!,1
Gate changes >4x/hr. Prepare to get excersize running to the next gate to find out the next clue to whether you made your flight or it has been delayed and moved again. They do this on purpose to make you spend money in the airport's restaurants. Huge vector zone to catch covid with 1000s of people running past each other in large crowds.,1
TSA at this airport is so horrible. TSA officers yelling instructions up and down the aisles. It's unbelievable to me they can't come up with a more efficient system. Everyone on one of my flights in a shear panic afraid of missing their connecting flight cause no airport employee is pushing the gate ramp up to the plane for over 15 minutes while pilot keeps apologizing.,1
"Frontier Airlines is by far the Worst Arlines I've ever flown on.
Two words constantly came up on a 2  1/2  hour flight to Cali from Dallas was Delay & Cancelled. This happened several times.
I never left the Airport. Almost 24 hours Delayed@ the DFW Terminal.To Book a Decent flight I would advise spend more money to avoid rapid constant unnecessary delays. Avoid Frontier and cheap Airlines when Traveling.",1
"Airport was clean and modern. Inadequate restroom locations and signage. Good flight from Yuma AZ into Dallas however the flight arrived minutes late
The connecting flight however was horrible experience.
Immediately after leaving first leg I hussled to meet the 2nd leg. Nearing the gate and in plain sight of the gate attendant, she shut the door, which was open at the time, she refused to allow several passengers to board plane to Daytona Beach. Was told if we had a complaint, go several gates down and get assistance for a flight change. No more fights to DB until the next day.
Landed at A, ran to B, only to be redirected back to B. On top of that had to find a different city to land in, Gainesville, Orlando, r Jacksonville. Chose JAX... Then after hours of waiting, boarded plane (1441)& a ""Covid related problem in the tower"" deborded waiting over 2 hrs. Finally, we are in decent to JAX, leaving me without transportation to my home and original destination, Daytona area Ormond Beach.
While waiting I overheard, and met at least 10 passengers that had the same type experience. 3 with the same gate attendant as I did at 5052, to DAB.",1
"Had a 5 hour layover, not by choice they change my reservation with out asking me.    3 hours into our time they change gate from D17 to D1, had a hard time getting help for my husband who needed a wheelchair.  We finally got help they took us there but 5 seconds after the guy leaves they change gates again,  there is no one to help us get a wheelchair for my husband so it took me 25 mins to get to the new gate and have someone go get him to the new gate.   bad service the whole way.",1
"I get there exactly at reservation time 2:00 I spoke to a lady over the phone before arriving and she said I was able to use a credit or debt, get to the counter debit is unacceptable ,  I don’t have any major credit cards I wish the lady explained on the phone more clearly. I’m was suppose to leave today now my reservation is canceled and every where else is charging me an arm and a leg to try and rent one out today. Whole vacation out the window! I will never give them business and make sure no one around me gives them business",1
"I would put no stars if it would let me. Never fly into this airport at no cost. If your flight dosent get canceled it is guaranteed that they will move your gate, probably minutes before it is supposed to board. Avoid this airport at all costs.",1
Full story. Went to the guy at the terminal C27 at 8:55 pm to ensure this was my flight because my boarding pass said one thing and the app said another. He points at the screen and and says yea don't  you see it departs at 9:40 pm. I come back at 9:33 pm they board a lady in a wheelchair and make no announcement. At 9:50 10 mins after boarding time i ask if there is a delay. They tell me the flight been left. How? People not doing their job.,1
"I am always getting delayed through this airport. Flight after flight. At first I thought it was a fluke, it happens.  However, after two years I realize it's not a fluke it is the norm. Its worse than O'Hare and I thought I'd never say that.  Wish I could give 0 stars. Plus enterprise is 20 minutes away. Has good selection of food If you're willing to ride the train from terminal to terminal. Which hey, you'll be doing that any ways with all the gate changes and flight delays

Update. Since the last time nothing has changed.  Delayed and missed connection once again, dfw drops the ball. I'll give them this, they are consistent at screwing the pooch. Wish my travel coordinator would quit using this airport. 0 star still applies",1
"They literally ripped my fiancés wedding dress going through security and did absolutely nothing about it except for saying “sorry, we’re not responsible.”",1
"Beware when booking flights with connections!! My daughter recently flew from Denver through DFW on her way to College Station. The flight was delayed out of DEN due to de-icing but still arrived into DFW at 0818. My daughter's next flight was due to depart at 0845. Upon her arrival to B33, her Iphone showed a time of 0835. I am still attempting to understand how my daughter and the fellow passengers found themselves at B33 at 0835 with doors closed and no plane at the gate, for a flight with a scheduled departure of 0845 that had a wheels up time of 0853 (18 minutes after my daughter arrived at the gate). The only flight available to rebook all of them on was 12 hours later on a 2045 flight.

My daughter sat down at the gate on her computer to secure a rental vehicle. After the fellow passenger and his wife had left the gate, my daughter witnessed four AA employees commenting and laughing about the situation. This inappropriate behavior of these employees is unprofessional in every way. They find it acceptable to laugh and make fun of the customers? Is this what AA is all about? Good customer service revolves around employees being competent, professionally, courteously and respectfully. This has not been what my daughter has experienced.

AA website describes how the organization handles disruptions: ""Our goal is to be a service and product leader in the airline industry. When customer service issues arise, we try to resolve them at the first point of contact. As a result, we have devoted resources to the front line and rely on our personnel to solve most problems during daily activity."" I lost count on how many points of contact I made in an attempt to obtain an explanation and resolution for this situation. Giving the reservations number to the passengers is of no help whatsoever. Reaching out to the dedicated ""Gold Status"" number, no help whatsoever. There is not a customer relations phone number to call; we are left with sending an email?! Are the employees that were laughing at this situation your ""devoted resources?"" I am most certain that AA has policies regarding the treatment of customers with dignity, and respect, and to conduct themselves in a professional manner at all times. These employees failed miserably. You can be assured that this added insult to injury.

After several attempts, I did receive replies from customer service who refused to compensate my daughter for the rental. The Customer Relations department is as far as my ""escalation"" would be permitted. I did write to the Executive VP of People and Communications who didn't bother to respond herself, instead sent it back to customer relations who replied for her. Again, refused to compensate my daughter for her rental.",1
"The skylink had to bypass our terminal twice due to undisclosed ""public safety"" problems.  We of course were not notified of these problems until after we were on the skylink itself.  The suggested detour?  Go walk an extra twenty minutes from the remote terminals across broken down (non) moving sidewalks with your luggage and small children.  Did we miss our connecting flight as a result?  Yes.  Does DFW care at all about the dozens of people similarly affected by this mass transit snafu?  Not a chance.",1
The handicap transport made me miss my flight to Detroit. He spent ten minutes with people who had time to catch their flight. I told him multiple times I had to go ori would miss. It didn't help. He ignored my requests.,1
"American Airlines Cancellation Fraud - My wife and I were kicked off a scheduled international flight only a few hours prior to takeoff. We were rebooked for a full day later. The stated reason was that the flight was cancelled. It wasn't. They had resold our seats. No compensation was given. To anyone that has been mistreated by American Airlines, I recommend that they initiate a small claims lawsuit. The cost is small. You should list American Airlines and their CEO, Doug Parker, as co-defendants. That is the only way to fight back!",1
"Under no circumstance should you ever fly American Airlines. If it is the only option you have, then you need to drive. My wife could have literally arrived from L.A. faster if she had driven. I wish I could give a middle finger instead of 1 star.",1
DFW seriously needs a facelift both inside and out and for heaven's sakes get rid of the archaic tolls that most of the time don't work and they have repair people constantly out there both on the South exit and the North... and it's ridiculous that we have to pay a toll just coming into the airport,1
"It sucked.   No help, no ticketing agents.   Get there 3 hours early.   Good luck!  We had to dump our luggage to make our flight.",1
Disorganized. Not set up well. Shuttle was jammed full of people. American does no t take temperatures prior to boarding. How is this place safe?  It's not,1
"My flight was delayed by 20 minutes, and the connection flight took off without 12 passengers. Hell of a time! Worst airport ever. And customer service doesn't help them at all",1
"Un aeropuerto a evitar en la manera de lo posible.

No solo tuve que quedarme con personas de más vuelos a dormir en el suelo, butacas y donde se pudiera -para despertar en la madrugada y buscar espacio en el primer vuelo del siguiente día.

Es increíble que un aeropuerto tan grande, moderno y base de una de las principales aerolíneas de ese país, debido a la lluvia cancelen tantos vuelos ✈️ saturando las cabinas y hoteles en el lugar, con muy mala comunicación y descontrol en el trato a los usuarios.

Lo más grave fue tener el infortunio de presenciar una escena de racismo contra el personal de la aerolínea y los pasajeros que se disponían a abordar su vuelo retrasado a México, del cual varias mujeres exigían se cancelara porque “America First”; tal fue el escándalo que tuvo que llegar la policía a aplacar a este grupo de mujeres seguidoras de Trump, que no podían controlarse en su exigencia desmedida con frases racistas y que poco les importaba estar siendo grabadas por viajeros de varias otras partes del mundo, quienes transitaban también sorprendidos en la misma ala.

Una pena.",1
"Much improved passenger experience in T2 but the signage needs to be improved especially directions to the different car parks. Check-in experience at Singapore counter was excellent. Staff very polite & friendly. The Special Assistance section is well located near check-in counters  - Was easily found & not tucked away out of sight in a corner, as in some other airports. Very good service from staff on duty. Thank you.",4
"Manchester Airport is an excellent choice for travelers seeking efficiency and convenience. During my recent visit, I found the airport to be well-organized, with clear signage and helpful staff available to assist with any queries. The security process was swift, and the facilities were clean and modern. With a wide range of shops, restaurants, and lounges, there's something to suit every traveler's needs. Additionally, the airport offers a variety of transportation options, making it easy to access from various locations. Overall, I had a positive experience at Manchester Airport and would recommend it to anyone flying in or out of the area.",5
"Manchester Airport absolutely impressed me on my recent trip. Here's what made it a fantastic experience:

Efficiency: Everything ran smoothly, from check-in to security. The lines were manageable, and the staff were helpful and efficient. Shoutout to the security team in Terminal ! you were all fantastic!

Amenities: The airport offered a great selection of shops and restaurants, with something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the Starbucks at Terminal 2. There were also plenty of comfortable seating areas to relax in before my flight.

Cleanliness: The entire airport was clean and well-maintained, which is always a plus.

Overall, Manchester Airport made my travel experience a breeze.

It was clear they prioritised passenger comfort and efficiency.

Highly recommend! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟",5
"Security was very fast at 4am, went through a new system scanned bags with no need to take laptop or liquids out. Very pleased. Within terminal 2 all food stores were open",5
We flew in and out of Manchester Airport this past weekend. We went through security fast and the staff was friendly. Plenty of shops and restaurants and easy access to our gates (EasyJet). We enjoyed our visit.,4
"Manchester International Airport have an impressive array of facilities designed to cater to the needs of even the most discerning travelers. From sleek check-in counters and efficient security checkpoints to spacious lounges and duty-free shopping, every aspect of the airport is meticulously designed with passenger comfort and convenience in mind.The staff at Manchester International Airport are friendly, professional, and always willing to go the extra mile to assist passengers in any way they can. Whether you need directions, assistance with luggage, or information about your flight, you can count on the knowledgeable and courteous team to provide prompt and helpful service. I really want appreciate the staff who providing transparent bags to travellers for the ease of checking procedures. Toilets and launches was extra clean and announcement were clearly audible in every corner. I feel it make this Airport very comfortable to frequent travellers.",4
"Efficient security team, some fantastic shops and clean facilities. A very good airport experience at Terminal 1.
Thanks for reading",5
"Large and modern airport, with some nice architecture and photography spots, yet food is sooooo expensive!!! When i come here, i have fairly often experienced delays, with my easyjet flight to lisbon being 3 hrs 30 mins delayed!! You get can some great pics though",3
"large and modern international airport served by dozens of companies for destinations all over the world. The terminals are connected to each other and can be reached in a few minutes on foot from one to the other. numerous shops, cafes and restaurants. a large and well-stocked duty free shop in each terminal.",4
"Very busy airport but decent facilities and great for plane watching before your flight!! Departed from Terminal 3 late afternoon - security was quick and easy but shops/food places were chaos. It’s got a good amount of seating though if you walk away from the main area, they have plugs too so you can charge your phone whilst sitting down. Toilets pretty clean and they have bottle refill stations around too which saves money and the environment. I’d come back just to plane watch to be honest!🤩",5
"We were fast tracked because I had my Autism lanyard and the appropriate identification/disability cards. So that took alot of stress off my shoulders.
But saying that, there wasn't much of a line or as many people as I was expecting.
There's absolutely no way I could navigate this place by myself and everything is so expensive! 😱",4
"Very clean and new airport. It has a variety of shop.
They are in trial with their new scanning machine, no need to take out liquids/electronics.",5
"It is truly embarrassing for a flagship International Airport. The journey from T3 to the arrivals pickup carpark is like walking through Pripyat, with temporary structures, unsurfaced footpaths, and faded road markings everywhere. Couple that with the brutalist multi-storey car parks that are still clinging on to life, and you have an intensely depressing experience. Arriving into this airport on a flight late at night, you are herded like cattle and made to wait whilst they summon some bleary-eyed security guard within to come and unlock the door (with a smashed window) to let you into the terminal building where the carpet has been gaffer taped within an inch of its' life. The rest of Europe must be laughing their socks off at us.",1
"I have used airport numerous times. Very busy airport with loads of facilities. There are loads of shops on site and in boarding area. Self check in and weighing machines are also onsite.  There are loads of parking spaces but can be quite expensive after 30mins, average of £20 for an hour. There are many airport staff on site as well that can help if you have any questions. Yes, hotel on site, but obviously will be very expensive I guess.",5
"When you think that this airport can not be worse, they surprise you again.
They have 3 fountains of free water, one not working and the other 2 barely gives you any water pressure
The corridors are crowded with bars and the distribution is horrendous.
They charge you to let people pick you up or leave you there and the suitcase trolley! Other airports give you 5 minutes or so for free.
The indications are not clear to navigate inside and outside the airport.
The security is slow and chaotic when you depart, and slow when you arrive. I need to use this airport because is near home, but every time I fly, I'm more and more tempted to use Liverpool that it is a way better airport.

They want to squeeze every single penny from you, giving nothing in return.

This airport is a clear example of how NOT to do things.

Update 11/02/24:
When you think they can not get worse, then you discover that your flight is 2 hours and a half late because they are doing maintenance works on a taxi way during the day, instead of planning it for the night.
The same when it snows, Frankfurt airport operating at 100% with 8 inch snow, Manchester airport struggling with a mere 2 inches...",1
"Manchester Airport is an international airport located in Greater Manchester, England. It's one of the busiest airports in the UK, serving as a hub for domestic and international flights. With three passenger terminals and a wide range of amenities, it offers flights to destinations worldwide. Additionally, it plays a significant role in cargo transportation and is a key economic driver for the region.",5
"Directions to airport parking good, bus transfer to terminal no problem, through security with minimal delay, good selection of shops etc whilst waiting to board, flight departed pretty much on time. The return journey was fine, we just had a slightly longer wait for the bus back to the car park but no cause for complaint. Thanks",5
"Nice little airport. So quick through security. Lots of shops. Feel the drop off fees and drinks prices after security are very steep and really unavoidable (yes, I could take an empty bottle for water or be dropped off some distance away from the airport for free, but I stand by my comment).",4
"Incompetent staff caused major delays. The woman at the check in/ticketing counter was untrained and could not properly issue boarding passes for connecting flights. Rather than find someone who knew what they were doing, she issued a boarding pass for the first leg of our journey only and simply shrugged, casually smiled and said they would “sort it out” in Amsterdam. We arrived in Amsterdam to learn our trans Atlantic flight had left without us because airline staff in Manchester had not checked us in and they hadn’t known we had left the UK.

Our initial flight was also delayed 2 hours. Although this was not the airport’s fault at first, We attempted to find help to see if our itinerary could be re-booked or re-routed, knowing our connection would
likely be missed. We were told to “check the information desk” for assistance. Please see below photo of the empty information desk where no help was received. The gate agent similarly shrugged and told us she could do nothing for us and there wouldn’t be any flights back to the United States and that we’d have to get “sorted” in Amsterdam. She was blatantly wrong and appeared more interested in adjusting her artificial nails then finding up to date information - there were three other KLM flights to the eastern U.S. out of Manchester that same morning.

Security was similarly grossly incompetent.

Avoid Manchester Airport at all costs. Pay extra to go through London, Dublin, or Belfast if possible.",1
"Can only speak for the railway station at Manchester Airport. Everything worked as it should have. Trains on time and plenty of room to sit.

Recently used for long haul through terminal 2. Excellent service, no delays outbound or return. Loung was excellent value with all you can eat breakfast and coffees. Certainly use it again.",5
"The motorway junction was closed for maintenance. Luckily, our taxi driver had an alternate route, so we had no delays.

T3 is largely self check-in at little terminals, but they are not the most intuitive, and there are assistants to guide you.

Security is a bear as usual but much more helpful than either T1 or T2, which are always a nightmare.

There is not enough seating in the general areas, but the screen updates do guide you to which gate your flight will be at.

We are lucky that due to a hidden disability I am able to use the slightly quieter and more comfortable seats in the assistance area. This is a bonus as T3 quickly becomes overwhelmed.

There are loads of decent food choices for everyone, but again, these are quickly full up.

Manchester Airport is far too big and complex, and even smaller countries provide a much more pleasant experience. They are getting upgrades all the time, but nothing seems to get any better.

The parking and drop-off charges are an absolute disgrace and blatant profiteering. It started after 9/11, but they got used to the extra revenue, and now it's just a greedy joke.",3
"Well this is such a great improvement, we gone through T2; all the checks in less than 40 minutes. The new scanners are brilliant, quick and very easy. I hope this is the sign of things to come. Well done MAN Airport",5
Manchester airport is the local airport for people living in lancashire & surrounding areas. A very nice airport but there are always big ques. So would advise people to travel well ahead of there flight time. Getting baggage through customs takes time. There are shops & cafes to buy food & snacks & also gifts & souveniers. Also there are lounge areas to rest before you travel. You can also purchase some duty free goods Its also makes it easier to drop people off & pick people up after there flights too,5
Terminal 2 is a large spacious modern airport.,5
"Airport was great. Tsa officers were rude and disrespectful. They threw away my meds bottle, water bottle and deodorant. Items were not on list of things could not have. Water bottle in clear container. Same water bottle the sell in airport.  The worst experience I have ever had with TSA would be here. Be careful traveling.",5
"It was pretty quiet when I got there. Security was pretty quick to go through, although my coat required 2 passages in the scanner. However, the cafe by the gate closed before I could get a bite to eat.",4
"Definitely feels like an airport that has become too popular for its facilities. Flew out of T3 and we were left with no seating, one small water bottle refill point and limited access to departure updates unless you’re sat in the restaurants. Security seems to change each time.

Needs an update to bring inline with how busy it gets.",3
"Performance at this airport varies depending on the day. Most of the time you go through security very quickly, other times the queue can be 2 hours long.

Trolleys are not free, so better to bring luggage with wheels. The moving walkway also does not work (they have not worked for years), so be ready to carry your luggage for a walk from the train/tram stop to the terminal.

This airport only allows liquids that can fit into a small transparent bag. Putting liquids in check-in luggage rather than taking them with you onto the plane would be best.

There is a drinking water station in Terminal One after the security point. Bring a water bottle with you and save a few quids.",3
The new upgrade to Manchester Airport made the security process more smooth. Not having to remove liquids and electrical equipment saves loads of time. Let's hope they can get this across the whole department,5
Arrived at meet and great. Car parking could've be simpler. 5 minuets and a 50meter walk to terminal 2. Easy directions to check-in. I  was walking with a stick. Looked after well without asking. Nice shopping.  Nice food. Very friendly staff. Not far to gates.  Good experience.,4
"New terminal 2 revamp is style over substance (currently). The seats provided are rock hard and uncomfortable for any medium to long duration (and forget trying to get any sleep on them...), the tannoy security message every 20 minutes is too loud at night and annoying (again stopping ANY chance of sleep waiting for an early morning flight), check-in side the night-time food and drink options are poor, and the journey from the train / metro station to T2 is currently long and without travelator assistance. All in not a great experience even in the refurbed terminal. Also on the return trip the train station got overcrowded, and the train (that was late) into the platform then became hugely overcrowded, much to the driver's admitted surprise on the tannoy, and resulting in even more delays - it's almost as if Trans Pennine railway aren't aware of the airport's plane arrivals that will unload hundreds of people at the airport station needing to leave it! On the plus side the new T2 does look good. But sorry, based upon my first experience it will take more than a cosmetic makeover to take Manchester Airport off the worst airport in UK list.",3
"This has to be the worst yet most expensive airport in Europe, and ranked low on a global level for its overall service.
The incompetence and greed of the airport management is unreal.
Dropping passengers off at the various Terminals is priced highly,  £5.00 for a basic 5 minute  ( maximum) drop off, after 5 minutes the parking prices rocket  !!
Duty Free is well stocked,  but many of the items available seemed to be cheaper in the supermarkets, yes it's 'duty free' but its certainly not profit free !!!!
Security check chaotic.  There's a lack of cleaning staff in most areas !
Toilets are a disgrace as they're not cleaned enough.
Travelators linking the main terminals haven't worked for over 4 years year and it's a long walk betweenTerminals !! Escalators are often out of action, causing passengers to carry luggage up and down the  stairs  !!
Why does the airport allow the homeless to sleep in various parts of the terminals  !! ??
This is a greedy greedy dirty airport that wants to bleed as much money out of passengers as possible  !!
There's a huge lack flight departure / information screens !!
APPALLING  !!!
Useful tip - Although you can't take water through the security check,  you can take your empty bottles through and refill, once through security, at the water fountain hidden away  !! Saves paying stupid prices for bottled water !",1
"This airport only deserves two stars,,, its a bloody kip and every time you come home after a holiday here it makes the mood just drop 😞
...this airport is confusing,  messy, full of choke points, broken escalators,  rip off taxis, and has a leaky roof causing hazards. It also lacks many departure and arrival screens.  Honestly one of the worst airports and trust me, I've been to many.
Look at the pictures yourself",2
"Our first experience at Terminal 1 of Manchester airport wasn’t the smoothest. When we finally reached security, having queued for roughly 45 minutes we found there were no trays to place our bags in and were left standing for another 15 minutes until one of the many idle staff members presented some trays for us to use. Shortly after this, we passed a water fountain before heading through duty free and assumed there would be more in the main body of the Terminal only to find this was the only fountain in the whole terminal so if you have an empty bottle, fill it up when you have the opportunity rather than having to retrace your steps like we did. There are a few shops and restaurants in the centre however as we made our way toward our gate (12) we ended up walking through a small corridor that sectioned us off from the rest of the terminal. We were flying with Emirates and when we reached the gate our boarding passes were scanned and we were directed into a fairly empty waiting room, not realising we were now unable to leave our gate where I may point out there were no toilets, shops or even vending machines. The room then filled up with many other people and became unbearably warm until we were finally allowed to board the plane. However as I said, this was our first experience at Terminal 1 so we will learn from our mistakes for the future.",3
"Pre departures and arrivals Terminal 1 . Scruffy -litter all over floor, nothing working, toilets filthy, cafes poor
What must people arriving from other countries think of this dump.

Terminal 2 departures good except we fast track and had to join normal queues",1
"Great airport, staff are lovely even the security staff which wasn't always the case. Obviously they have listened to the reviews well done Manchester. Much faster through security.",5
"Really busy terminal, not a lot of searching. Plenty of shops and cafés. Expect airport prices + . T3 is by far the dated terminal
T 1 and T 3 much better x",4
"Check in was fast and easy. Fast track not worth the money as after getting to the search area  was sent to stand behind people not in fast track.  Escape lounge was very good, taken to a tableaux told where everything was, staff friendly and helpful.",4
"Big airport, terminal 3 is not very convenient, there's nothing on the ground floor, not even a place to sit. When you go through the check in then it's more normal, but there are few shops and restaurants. But all in all a good airport.",5
"Terminal 3 is a bit of a magical mystery tour to get to from the Train Station. You go up an elevator, across a bridge, through a random building.

Security staff were quite curt, I never expect them to be super nice but they definitely seemed a little too rude.

There's a little used upper seating area in Terminal 3, if you have time before your flight.  It has sweeping views of the runway, and its own toilets.",3
"Unfortunately we try and avoid this airport whenever possible. Every time we visit we have issues at security which we don’t elsewhere also longer waits which don’t exist elsewhere either.

Last time we visited we were asked to take out my partners liquids as his liquid bag was too big apparently (he only had about 4 bottles in it). The man on control kept telling him to bin them! Like he was just going to throw away expensive aftershave.
They then watched as I put his liquids into my liquid bag and then allowed us to go through? What was the point of this? Now I have double the liquids I did before but somehow this is fine rather than him having them in his possession in a slightly oversized wash bag. He then immediately put them back in his bag on the other side. It’s like they want to purposefully cause hassle. Most ridiculous thing I have ever witnessed. Never again. He uses the same bag in every other airport in the world and it’s fine!",1
I found manchester airport easy to navigate and hassle free. Wish there were some better quality eateries and reasonably prices bars but otherwise OK. Quick boarding. No problems encountered,4
"worst airport ever doesn’t even deserve one star. staff are disgusting and rude and don’t know how to do their jobs properly, we flew from here and the lady at security was acting like a literal child, threatening to “throw away” expensive miss dior perfume only because we forgot to put it in a plastic bag, as well as wasting 30 minutes of our time because apparently your not allowed to bring prescription medication on board?absolute joke of a place, worst experience ever and completely ruined the start of our holiday, staff should be ashamed and learn to respect people with disabilities.",1
This is a city where antiquity meets skyscrapers... comfortable for living and relaxing. Beautiful in its own way,4
"The airport side ran very well, effective and efficient transit from the air side into the arrival pickup area, after that the route march to the railway station starts, made harder by the moving walk way that doesn't move and from my experience has not moved at least during my travels in the last 4 years. I guess that the airport management is  being environmentally friendly by saving the energy and reducing its operating overhead at the cost of the travelling public.",1
"Quite hit and miss. I have been many times and had experiences varying from some of the best I have ever had in an airport to the worst. Check before you travel as to how busy it is as check in  and security can take up to 2 hours or only 20 minutes. The facilities are good in the actual terminal- particularly in the new terminal 2, and the wide selection of destinations and firms from the airport make it convenient.",4
"Generally speaking our experience of being processed through Manchester Airport has been reasonable but never enjoyable. Terminal 2 is newer and more spacious than Terminal 1, a much nicer experience. Parking and passenger drop off seem expensive, but getting there is straightforward. Bag drop and security are usually OK but sometimes very slow, though staff are always polite and do their best to shepherd people through. Getting through the ever increasing array of shops is a test of patience, while the takeaway food offer is limited and obviously expensive. Virtually every flight we have taken in and out of this airport in the last 5 years has been delayed, typically about an hour each time. Baggage return has generally been fairly quick.",3
"Not the worst airport but having to pay for a 10 second drop off is an absolute disgrace, and if the point is to promote public transport at least use that money you're raising with those extortionate fees to make the travelators from the station work, they haven't in years! I know there is a 'free drop off' area (no option for pick up) which is just a parking lot in the middle of nowhere where a shuttle comes once in a while but you have no real clue as to when but all of these options are really not adequate for anyone with any sort of reduced mobility or even just people that are not familiar with the airport and have bad sense of direction really.",2
"Traveled alone with a baby. Queued 45 minutes to drop my bag. Queued 60 minutes at security check (even after they'd said they'd fast track me because of the baby). Pram was broken by them during the security check but they said it wasn't their fault. No compensation and no replacement pram, not even a courtesy pram for in the airport. Left to carry two backpacks and baby alone through the airport. Supervisor Steve in security is very rude (when I talked to him about the broken pram he said ""I don't know what you expect us to do about it. It's probably just a cheap pram that gets broken easily""). The actual luggage screeners are friendly and professional and helpful, and I feel sorry for them that they have such awful management higher up. I won't use Manchester Airport again.",1
"Updated review. Seems that 2022 issues are story of the past. Alll went smoth in my latest travels.
I did the normal queues in reasonable times in Terminal 1. Arrival was also quickly served.

Old review:
I have used this airport many times but the 2022 experience is far from ideal. You have very long queues on security (expect between 1 and 2 hours). If you are in the rush do the £5 fast track otherwise you are going to miss your flight.
One bad and unique thing that happened to me lately was that we had to stay for more than one hour inside the airplane after landing in the evening because there was not staff to put the ladders to come down. First time in my long life that something like that happens to me.
The selections of flights and prices are OK but be aware and prepared for disruptions.",5
"Excellent going out and very impressed with the efficiency on return from border control to collecting luggage. Jet parks 3 shuttle service really good.
Only negative that there is more illuminated signage to the jet parks as I couldn't find jet park 3 in the dark",5
Another visit to one of the worst airports  anywhere. Terminal 3 this time. Right from the start you're made to feel like an unwelcome nuisance by the security people. Even when you do exactly what they ask you're being told off for not being polite enough for these snowflakes. Absolutely awful experience. Few seats and only a handful of shops and restaurants.,2
Good airport with a wide variety of shops and bars in terminal 2. The only problem I would say the place has is it's simply too small with the terminal facilities for a place which has such a huge number of people going through it. We were going through early September and it was packed!,4
Recommend the JetParks parking options with regular free bus transfers to all terminals. Comfy seating upstairs at T3 departures. Free WiFi not the strongest.,4
"Great airport, recently a lot more improvements, however old terminal is complicated to access and parking can be an issue also extortionate parking charges. Manchester is the second busiest city in UK, the amount of passengers travels to and from this airport is phenomenal but the airport should be a lot more advanced and better.",4
"Ok, I've been to smaller airports with fewer facilities, but in this one, I always get irritated. The staff is aggressive, the check-in takes too long, and their rules are strict without a specific reason.
The gates are often announced 40' before the departure, whereas in other airports, that info is available almost 2 hours before.
The experience in Manchester airport is always stressful.

Oh, and as a cherry on top, a staff member through my laptop in another box while checking in, and the screen broke (=>600€ damage).

I would leave a bad review either way, though.",1
"The airport is fine, but the security service is atrocious. I appreciate they have a very important role to carry out, and obviously we need them for that, but that does not mean they don't have to provide any form of customer service.

The customers pay their salary after all.",2
45 minute wait to open security doors so we could get to the departure gate. Standing in a dingy corridor (not many seats) for all that time followed by a rushed boarding process. Air travel is stressful enough without adding to it like this.,1
"Due to the friendly staff, otherwise the rating would be terrible. That is the people you actually meet - not the service  staff intended. The nice people working in and around the airport they're in maintenance, facility cleaners, luggage truck drivers, safety staff etc who took time to direct, suggest and encourage.
The place itself is not welcoming, there's not a single chair or bench to sit down on unless it's an establishment.",2
"Easy access, plenty of parking (recommend booking parking in advance, super easy number plate recognition and hassle free as the pay in advance car parks are separate, so stress free). Manchester is a fast and efficient airport especially if you do sensible things like pay for Fast Track in security. I've never had a problem. Great airport to travel from...",4
"Loads of choice of food outlets is better than most.  Staff were friendly. Security was fastidious.  Add with most brush airports, it's functional without much soul.

My main issue is parking. Ridiculously expensive, even if pre booked.  Bays are narrow.  Suggest you give yourself and extra 20 minutes to find a spot when planning your timing.",2
"Never seen so many people had their bags pulled by security. Women in front of me was delayed for having a bar of soap. Had 2.5ml of scent taken off me, despite having been through 7 times before in other airports,  and even pointedly told by others to not put it in plastic bag. Offered the chance rather rude security guy to use a plastic bag if I had one to put it through, but wife and kids had already gone; was not possible to use one of the several hundred they had dangling there for the purpose. Poor taste left.",1
"Arriving in and out of Manchester Airport in the past couple of months has been less traumatic than when the year began. Transitioning from Terminal 1and 3 to Terminal 2 is a labourius walk. The escalator are switched off and renovations are an ongoing pain. Arriving passengers  need a pound or two to use a trolley for their luggage, which is an inconvenient expectation for people arriving at the airport from abroad. Some of these will be forced to lug their luggage 🧳 around if they do not have a pound. Heathrow is better in this regard. Terminal 2 has had a welcome makeover so the departures floor looks spacious. There a few vending machines in places. At the time of my visit, the check-in queue for Ethiopian Airways was long though the staff tried their best to keep queues going. Past the security gates, duty-free 🛍 shopping is worth a try. Nice food too. Retrieval of bags on the BA flight from London Heathrow after transition from  Virgin Airways and AirLink connection was stressful. One of my bags 🎒 was delivered 4 days after I had arrived.",3
Probably the worst airport I’ve ever been to. Layout is awful. Old and not very nice. The boarding gates are like hallways. It’s not very efficient at all!,1
"Well run, easy to navigate.... ....but my god is it expensive!! The lack of non zero alcohol is a shame. I know everyone (and myself ) likes a drink to start off the journey but my partner is T Total and would have liked her normal non alcohol tipple. They seem to cater for everything else. The young man on the money exchange was very helpful and the ladies on the bar upstairs were full of fun and very efficient.",5
"This airport ranks as the least favorable I've experienced, having travelled through 28 countries. Basic amenities, such as trolleys, come with a fee, and the facilities are in poor condition and unclean. If  other alternatives are available, I recommend considering alternative airports for your travels.",1
"An embarrassment to Manchester. Drop off and collection so unorganised and appears to be deliberately badly designed in order to delay passengers and separate them from even more cash. Terminal 3 way too small for the number of passengers and flights. Low ceilings, up and down stairs the place is claustrophobic. Terminal one is no better. The roads around the airport are confusing. Not a pleasant experience.",1
"Changes to airport parking, roads and especially signage have made access difficult and expensive.
Finding your way to arrivals at Terminal 2 driving a vehicle is difficult to say the least, arrival directions are within a sign with multiple directions. Exiting carpark not much better, overhead signs point directions and then a small one for the exit. Prices are very expensive at £6/30 mins.
Airport itself is good with friendly helpful staff. Coffee shops were open for first arrivals.",3
Landed just after 7pm. Was through passport control really quickly. Waited about 15mins for our cases and then outside to get a black cab home. Airport really clean and toilets near baggage reclaim were really clean to.,5
"I got the worst travel experience of my life at Manchester Airport. It was the first time I'd use the airport and I needed wheelchair assistance for my 5-year old son. Quite alright, the wheelchair was brought for us at the plane entrance, but the ABM guy refused to push my son. I was travelling with my family and had about 8 bags, their trolleys are small and out 1 pound each. I had to buy 2 trolleys. I explained to the Global Baggage Solutions team that I would need help to wheel the boy if I will be able to push the trolleys. They made calls and delayed us for about 2 hours and nobody would wheel my son. We ended up incuring more charges for our booked shuttle due to an extended parking period, yet we had to improvise as no one would wheel the boy.
It's simply disappointing. We travelled through Doha, Qatar and got a kingly treatment because of our son, only to arrive in the UK and get the worst treatment. Someone should please address this at the airport.",1
"T1 is a dark, dingy, meandering maze but to be fair it will close in 2025. Overall though, the airport is easy to get to and we breezed straight through security. The facilities, shops, cafés etc are adequate for short haul flights. Appalling WiFi.",4
"Never had a problem flying out of Manchester Airport or landing back in Manchester, Friendly and polite staff, Spotlessly clean, Straightforward instructions, flown from Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 several times without issue.

My biggest bit of advice would be put any make up, toiletries, Electrical items(Dont need to be a bag)etc into a see through plastic bags(We use zip freezer bags from home bargains) and place them in your small handluggage, BackPack, Carry on bag(So you can take them out and put them on the tray going through Security) make sure everything you are taking makeup/toiletries are UNDER 100ML or Security will confiscate them and throw them away.

Second bit of advice is book Fast Track Security(Thank us later), We booked on the Manchester Airport website then when we booked with Jet2 on the app we added Fast Track and then again when we booked with Ryanair the Fast Track was added to our QR code in the boarding pass.

Safe flight and have a great time.",5
"We not been through Manchester airports in a few years, then 2023, twice in quick succession.

Park and ride, regular buses, drops you right at the terminal. Yup that works.

Drop off, busy, and you now have to pay, and you’re time limited. The latter I would assume comes because it is busy, and people probably used to hang around when dropping people off.

Check in, looks to be going more self service as such, but there are still plenty of staff to guide you, and the get you to the point where your bags are weighed and checked in. In both times of used the airport this seemed to be quicker then the old one after another queues.

Security, all seems better structured and organised than it used to be. We got through this quickly and efficiently on both trips. Top tip, read the signs and listen to the instructions, it helps the staff get you checked and through.

Duty free is duty free. The other shops airside, well over priced, but your a captive audience at this point so you have no choice but to be ripped off.

Other airside thoughts, couldn’t get booked into vip lounges for either trip, despite plenty of advance time, a shame and disappointment. The areas and shops were clean and tidy, the toilets were too, there were free water fountains, free usb charging points, plenty of screens with departure info, and the boarding process for both trips was quick and hassle free..",4
"Terminal 2 is very modern with several good places to eat/drink before a flight. The restaurants on the upper level had long waiting times for a table, so we decided to get a take away drink and find some seating downstairs. We travelled in February so I can imagine in the summer months that this place will be working at full capacity.

On arrival back from holiday there was also long queues for passport control. Luckily the line for e-passports moved quick, but if you were one of the unfortunate ones that couldn't get your passport scanned, there was a further 20 minute wait to get it manually checked.

T2 car park is very good, just a few minutes walk back to the car after your holiday.",4
"Manchester airport is the worst airport in the whole world.

Nothing is designed for the comfort or dignity of the passengers, everything is hugely expensive. The staff are overworked and stressed, there are very few of them.

Passengers are herded and treated worse than livestock. The aim is to get you the hell out of there as expensively and unhelpfully as possible. The travellators are never on, you have to walk for miles everywhere.

The shops are always closed early. Evening passengers are faced with rows of closed shops, other international airports have 24-hour shops to provide a service to passengers, the ones at Manchester are run for pure profiteering and are shut outside of core hours, regardless of the fact that passengers are there needing the service 24 hours a day.

Access by car is so expensive as to be impossible: they charge you for dropping passengers off and the charges ramp up whilst you are stuck in the queue of cars that are stuck at the unfeasibly slow barriers. They advertise a free drop-off and shuttle bus service but the buses don't run from terminals to return incoming passengers to the drop off points, you have to walk more than a mile to get there.

You are made to feel as unwelcome as it's possible to be.

We are proud of our city of Manchester but the airport is embarrassingly shameful.

I can't think of a single good thing to say about Manchester airport.",1
"Quite efficient considering airport's can be troublesome. Very friendly helpful staff, clean toilets, good food options, great parking and hotels very close. Terminal 2 is being transformed for 2025, all round, fab airport, thanks guys.",4
"Pro Tip: Look at the Radison Blu hotel as a place to go before your flight.  Actually just take the train down to london and fly from London City Airport, even Heathrow is better.

Worst airport I have been to and I've been to many 3rd world countries.   Dirty toilets, travelators (moving walkways) turned off along the sky walk, buckets collecting water in same skywalk which I've seen there now and 3 years ago every year I go through there.
You have to pay for luggage trolleys (at arrival carousel and departures)
Worst lines for security even though lots of stalls/lanes for doing the job.
Have to pay to drop off or collect passengers.  I rather walk to the airport hotel pub and get an Uber from there to save a lot of money.
Car parking is expensive and if you view the airport from Google maps then you can see how huge the parking is, it almost overtakes the airport size for the aircraft.
The poorest airports in Asia have far more for the passenger than here.",1
Want to share my opinion on PASSPORT CONTROL and commend the experienced Officer who exercised his professional diligence when presented with my damaged passport....inputting my details manually and allowing me through with the instruction that I will have to replace my passport for any further trips abroad.,5
"Nice airport to fly to and from. But if your taking someone or picking them up, its very expensive in the short stay carpark. £12 for about twenty minutes. I think its for an hour really so I would get my moneys worth if I was you. And it's better than getting a fine for parking in the wrong place.",3
"It functions but it's not a comfortable airport. From over crowded security lines to narrow corridors and pathways, the airport feels makeshift with no single vision of user experience especially in the flow. Staff are helpful as passengers bumble from section to section. Even the layout of the tram/ train station is odd with ticket machines tucked (almost invisible ) away to the left, so visitors end up queuing at the counter. And given how wet it is, no fully covered walkway from train to departures . The airport and supporting infrastructure needs investment to reflect the ambition of Manchester city.",3
"Terminal 2 is just amazing
After being fully refurbished, it's now a modern, awesome, and efficient space. Easy to pass security without the usual struggle, they even have a scan for your shoes only, so you don't have to take them off (I hated it ).",5
"This review is specifically relating to terminal 3 at Manchester airport, as I have previously had better experiences travelling to and from terminal 1. Terminal 3 appears in desperate need of some funding. It appears dangerously overcrowded and there's not enough seats or facilities to cater for all travellers. There is little choice for people hoping to do some shopping or having a sit down meal, and the only operating lounge always appears to be at capacity. The whole terminal feels run down, neglected and the atmosphere is not pleasant. Due the design of the dining area, the noise level is unbearable at times. I feel for the staff here who are all doing the best they can. When you arrive at terminal 3 the passport control is also absolute chaos. I witnessed people getting trapped in the tunnel coming off the plane as security doors closed and there were no staff around to help. The cues here were also ridiculous. The terminal is simply not able to accommodate the amount of people coming through at either end and it feels like a disaster waiting to happen.",2
"Seems to be a reasonably well setup airport and staff were helpful. The covered walkways are good, especially when the weather has been so cold. Pity the moving walkways weren't operating. I was wearing smart leather soled shoes, and when walking through the shops after leaving the security check, I found the smooth tiled floor to be like walking on ice. Looks nice, but very hazardous.",4
I have mobility problems.  The walkway was switched off. Had to go to terminal 3. Got off the tram. No signs for the terminal. Had to go looking for directions. By the time I walked to terminal I was totally exhausted. Will not be using Manchester airport again. Don't look after people with mobility issues. Shocking this experience.,1
Never seen terminal 3 so quiet. Through security in 5 minutes. Place is clean and tidy with staff doing more.,4
"Large airport flying from terminal 3.
Parked right outside doors for drop off and smooth check in. Assistant was very helpful with luggage bag exceeding my allowance weight.
However, for a large airport duty free and cafe area poor.",5
"One of if not the worst run airport I’ve ever seen, security in T3 should all be sacked they don’t have a clue what there at, stopped  us for  carry on bags and told us two were fine to go on the plane an when questioned why  the other wasn’t was told to mind your own business, the same bags with nothing extra in them got through are Irish airport absolutely fine, when I asked for a manager/supervisor the security officer turned his back on me an then proceeded to tell my friend his bag was too big after telling him 2 mins previously it was fine when we kicked up a fuss about this they told us to lose the attitude or we wouldn’t be boarding are flight, an absolute disgrace an it’s not the only problem I’ve had with this airport, as a paying customer should be treated with a bit of respect which is completely lacking by the so called security who all seem to have a chip on there shoulder or some sort of god complex, place is in ruins an the price of everything is daylight robbery, I’d avoid this airport at all cost unless ya like getting talked to an treated like a dog. Actually my dog would be treated better an absolute shambles of a airport should be ashamed of yourselves",1
Very busy airport ..passport control system very easy and quick.,5
"The new Terminal 3 is a lot more convenient and has reduced the stress and queues you’ll usually get at the other two terminals.

There’ are adequate scanning machines and the queues move super quick. Except it is a really busy time, you can get through security within 15-20 minutes.

The only problem is it is a bit of a walking distance from the train station. Otherwise, it’s not too shabby.",4
"Took the children for the short concord tour and we all enjoyed. Spectacular plane, great outdoor play area out looking the landing planes and brilliant cafe area.",5
"Dirty. The moving walkways don't work. Some lifts don't work.

It's a barely maintained dump. The management should quit or go to a proper airport and learn how to do their job.

Edit: The walkways still don't work 4 months later.  On landing a door was locked meaning passengers couldn't get into the building.

Maybe you could sell the walkways for scrap because they never work. Some mad Italian woman asking out loud for Coca Cola no staff helping her.

Trash airport. Who's running this place? Sack them immediately and get someone competent in.",1
"The fast track is always the slowest line, so it’s completely useless to pay for the fast track service. Plus I never seen an airport so picky and sensible with the security bags check process, I feel sorry for the employee cause they always too busy because of it. It’s the worst airport organisation I’ve seen so far and I’m flight attendant. The good point of the airport is the many shops they have which is very convenient before traveling.",2
So hit and miss. Sometimes you come and Que at every turn and other times you don’t miss a beat and you’re at the gate in no time. Today was a good day! Everyone was doing their job effectively! The place was clean toilets were clean. What more can you ask for!,4
"The Security Staff in (T1) are definitely less polite and helpful than in , other U.K. Airports.
I firmly got the impression they considered their bruffness towards passenger a “ badge of honour”. Management needs to address not what they say, but the way they say it.",2
"Attention all travelers! Friendly reminder: in this airport, a zipped toiletries bag is your best friend! Trust me, you don't want to get into a tug-of-war with security over an open shampoo bottle. Common sense seems to be on vacation here, but hey, let's give them a hand! Even if your bag could close with one finger, it's no match for their eagle eyes. Turns out, they've got a passport full of stamps too, and this rule is a universal language! With over 120 flights under my belt last year alone, I can confirm, it's a world tour of the same old song. So, let's all pack a little extra education and politeness in our carry-ons, because that's the real ticket to smooth sailing! ✈️🧳",1
"All terminals bar terminal 3 are pretty nice. I personally find terminal 3 rather lacklustre and unfortunately it's the main one I've been flying out of lately. It doesn't have a smoking area in terminal 3 either, so if you like cigarettes, have one prior to going through security check-in.

Both T1 and T3 (not used T2 in a very long time) are very quick at processing for check-in (if you have cases) with the ability to do it yourself via the online machines that frequent the area near the front desk.

The security for each is pretty quick and apt and easy to navigate. Staff are dotted along the snaking barriers before the metal detectors to tell you what you need to take off and put in the boxes.

T1 has a much more superior array of shops/eateries - check my profile - and a smoking area too. They have a broader more well known collection of food outlets.
T3 has a boots, Costa and 'in-house' gastropub. That also serves breakfast. Watch the prices though.

Both t1 and t3 have a wide range of toilets spaced throughout easily walkable locations, for anyone who gets those last minute nerves.

At the end of the day, it's an airport and you're coming here for a specific reason. But both t1 and t3 will be able to cater for most people.",4
"Flight was from the  new terminal 2. Very quick through security. All café ,bar, shops, and seating areas were spotless",5
"Busy Airport. Heed seriously, the advice of being here 3 hours before your flight. The queues could be very long for security clearance and could even start earlier for you if you have ""oversized baggage""

There's a walking link to all the terminals from the bus and train stations.

Return through Manchester Airport is fast. You can get cabs from the lobby or better walk outside and bargain with the cabs at the taxi bay. The lobby guy on the desk is quite pricy. You can also access the bus or trains from here, too.",3
"I'd score this higher if it wasn't for the predominantly rude and unprofessional staff managing the security section. To tell a family ""no-one asked you to come to the airport "" when their very young son got upset about being swabbed is completely unacceptable",3
"Zero stars would be more correct. Welcome to dirty, sleezy, rip-off Britain at its worst. Drop-off and pick-up allow not only make arrival and departure the most stressfull start and end of a trip, Manchester Airport is travel hell for everyone, but especially for people with mobility issues. Far from barrier free with passengers expected to climb up and down stairqwells, pray there is never a fire in the terminal buildings because it is programmed to lead to hundreds of casualties. Having to walk through half a mile of shops and over-filled departure halls with over-priced food and drink is challenging. Even the assisted travellers have to walk from the drop-off to an area in the departure hall unassisted because their drop-off car only has five minutes to drop them off or face a £25 extra on top of the extortionate £5 access fee! Assistance stops at the doors so how are passengers supposed to travel on by train? Walkways have not worked for many years. The only plus in the whole lamentable disaster zone which calls itself an airport, are the irrepressible cheery Mancunians who have to put on a brave face every working day.",1
"I didn't go into the airport but dropped off & picked up, so this review is about that.

I dropped off at the 'free drop off point' which can be located using Google Maps. It was very easy to find & as the title says, it was free. Do not pick people up here unless you want a £100 fine. Even though I dropped off at 4am the area was very busy but it caused no delays.

Picking up was an entirely different kettle of fish. I used the terminal 3 pick up car park (again, found on Google Maps). Easy to find but the signs stating ""spaces"" is a lie. I drove around the whole 5 floor multistorey car park for 20 minutes before I gave up looking for an empty space and just parked to one side of the car park roadway on the 4th level. My car is small so other vehicles could pass me easily. There I just waited until my friend's flight landed & he managed to locate me (using Google Maps location sharing). For the privilege of not being able to find an empty parking bay I was charged £12 for 33 minutes. The charge is £6 for 30 minutes. Yeah, a ripoff.

I get the impression that if you're not flying they don't want you there. At least I could see the planes landing while I waited.",2
"Probably the worse transit design/layout for international travel. You basically have to walk around the whole entire airport in a giant loop and go through security again to get back to the same gate. Also, there should be more toilets available and please refill the soap dispensers.",1
"Easy to travel to via car or train and easy to navigate to find your correct terminal.

Update - on my return....

Black cab from outside T3 to Liverpool was £100. No one was on the streetcar desk inside the terminal to book a private taxi.",4
"For such an important and relatively major airport, I was disappointed on my 2 visits/ experiences here so far.

While I can praise the location and modern infrastructure , my main issues are related to the service(s) here. The staff were not very helpful or polite, queues take unnecessarily long to process, there aren't very precise directions around the airport (which was very frustrating), the toilets were not very clean and I found myself being quite uncomfortable while in there.

There is definitely room for improvement in these areas, and I hope management would work on these.",3
Travelled on Emirates to Dubai from T1 Check in was quick and easy and no wait going through to departures.  Emirates lounge very good. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Food and drink very good. Duty free area eas clean and tidy. All staff very helpful.,5
"Gorgeous airport. T2, bright and clean. Walkway from train station is long but lots of places to sit and relax and moving walkways. Hotels are on the way to the terminal. Bright and clean. Very impressive.",5
"I can imagine lots of people having a wide range of experiences here from excellent to appalling.   Our visit this time was OK.  We flew from terminal 1.  Arriving by car we used meet and greet this was easy to find and relatively easy to use.  The departure entrance is just across the road.  Checking in was speedy...did it on line b4 we arrived.  Flew with easyJet.   Then getting through security was a pain, we walked forever, and took a lift to get to security as there seemed to be maintenance work in areas.  Security staff seemed to bark instructions at people and it can only be likened to being tret like herded cattle.  Once in the departure lounge things are more relaxed and there are plenty of places to shop, eat and drink.",3
Busy! Staff where we were extremely helpful allowing us to move to the right area at check-in quickly! However upon getting to the custom control area all that was lost and very nearly late to board the aeroplane!,5
"At about 1-2am on April 16th I was trundling around outside Terminal 1 for ages, shivering with cold looking for my taxi. Everyone else had gone and I was really down when an employee of Manchester Airport came to my rescue. His name was TERRY and he had a bus. He kindly expressed his real concern for me. He then carefully marshalled all the facts and dealt with the complicated matter calmly and efficiently. He organised for the taxi firm. who should have to come to pick me up to seek me out at a specified point inside the T1 building so that I could warm up. His plans all worked superbly. A taxi driver picked me up and took me home safely.

I owe TERRY a great deal, he was not forthcoming with his surname and said he didn't drink when I wanted to buy him  some form of award. He richly deserved one.

The management have in TERRY a shining example of how much care of their customers. He also shows how good Manchester and Mancunians are. (not specious pleading, I live in Chester).

Many grateful thanks, TERRY.

Mike S Brennan",5
"I have been to this airport more than 7 times on my holidays over the last few years and with being a taxi driver dropped off and picked up more than 100 times. And it has a terrible layout and service is next to nothing. For a UK airport it is shocking I honestly feel like they let kids loose in the planning meetings and used them ideas and plans.
If another airport is maybe a little more expensive I'd pick the other.
Very expensive picking up and dropping off, staff in the car parks are unforgiving as well, an honest mistake can cost you a fortune",1
"Terminal 2, fairly new terminal, very busy, the staff were in control, getting everyone through asap. Cash points located at a few places, places where you can get a bite to eat also available, seating areas are available, however at busy times very rare you will get a place to sit down and toilets are available. Family member was flying with Saudia Airlines very helpful courteous staff, serving you with a smile and very helpful. The assistant area for the disabled was first class service by the lady at the desk.",5
"Did the Jet 2 twilight check in. Brilliant free parking at T2 West multistorey. No queues and an easy walk to terminal from the car park. Takes a lot of the strain out, when travelling with young kids.",5
Good airport with good facilities. Plenty of staff. Customs are very strict .Make sure you only put essential in hand luggage.  Can be long walk to terminals from bus and train stations. Good fairly fast baggage check in  several check in points for each airline .  Arrivals take about 30 mins max . Meeting point as leave  customs exit . Overall good I have used airport number of times.,4
Simply doesn’t have the infrastructure for the amount of passengers going through. If they cared less about profit and a little more about passenger experience perhaps they would have more that average 3 stars. The worst airport in the world,1
"Coming out of the terminal 2  building and then trying to find the car park for the taxi pickup is so difficult because there are no direction signs.
The taxi had to pay £6.00 to park for a pickup, do other airports charge...
You would think the airport doesn't want anyone to be there...",3
Very quick and easy check in with Ryan Air. Short wait at security (10 mins ish) but the man who was working there had a great sense of humour and kept the queue amused. He was called Andrew Green and deserves a bonus!,5
"Lounge in terminal 1 roasting. No air conditioning. Selection of food rediculus. Bread on display wasdry with edges curling. After paying forr entry you have pay extra for proseco.
Separate issue..wheelchairs not allowed on moving walkways. Complete insanity.",1
"Was only dropping off and picking up, but staff were really helpful with my flat tyre. Only downside is the sign posting. Not clear enough and not enough signs, to guide you where you need to go. Drive around for 19 minutes looking for pick up zone.",4
"Worst airport I have ever experienced in my entire life. Expect a 3+ hour wait to check in bags and go through security, only for staff to not be able to distinguish between liquids and creams. Staff were so slow and not able to efficiently process the queue, resulting in circumstances where people almost missed their flights. Will go out of my way to avoid this airport in future. It’s worth paying extra to fly in and out through London instead.",1
"WORST AIRPORT TO TRANSFER OR FLY OUT OF!!!

We were coming from Dublin and there is no train to transfer to from terminal to terminal. 25 minute walk. On top of that, ALL of their moving escalators were not working. We get to security and they’re not specific about what is allowed. Lip balm apparently is liquid and they never told us to take laptops or iPads. The idiot lady could not point out my lipstick which is lip balm to them and liquid. Our bags had to go through security like 5 times because these sheep farmers that don’t belong working at the airport.
It’s not our fault that there’s a heavy traffic of people that look like terrorist  (thanks to Bush). Everything gets tested for gun powder.
What really pissed me off is that they guide you to go through their duty stores even if you do a whole circle around their security again. Our flight was boarding and the man at security told us that you’re not late until is 15 minutes before takeoff.
VERY InconsideratE of people’s time!!!!",1
Arrived after 8 hours on board A380 from Dubai.   Felt as if we’d arrived in third world. Long walk. The one and only escalator broken. People lugging huge suitcases down stairs. Finally arrived at fast track passport control. Stood for over 20 minutes while the single officer went walkabout. No apology. Daring us to comment.  What did we pay for. Suggest that all managers and staff take a trip round the world to some properly run airports.  It seems no one is ever accountable for this rubbish service.,3
"Good, wide approaches to the airport and plenty of signage to guide drivers to where they need to go. There's no drive-in/drive-off pick-up point for T1 Arrivals, so drivers have to use the T1 Short Stay car park. At £6 for the first 30 minutes, it pays to time your arrival with when your passengers are already through passport control and have recovered their luggage. After 30minutes the charge increases to £12 for the first hour. So long as drivers stay focused and coordinate with their passengers, it is a very efficient system.",4
"Worst airport in the world. Every time there is something… bag drop or security. This time my handbag (no liquids) went off to the dreaded lane to get searched, turns out it hadn’t been scanned at all so waited in a queue for it to be put back through without issues.  If it wasn’t on my doorstep I’d go elsewhere especially as it costs to get dropped off and picked up as well. The airport experience used to be part of the holiday fun, not any more!",1
"I’ve been to more than 50 countries and this is by far the worse experience I had in an airport. Inefficient security and annoying guards. And mind I did everything correctly and no altercation or problem. Poorly designed airport, long queues overlapping through multiple gates. The slowest airport I’ve been to. Come 3 hours before your flight.",1
"I had international flights arriving and departing from Terminal 1.  The arrivals section wasn't the best.  The walkways were a bit more cramped than many airports, and the escalators were not working.  Immigration for arriving on a weekday around lunchtime was quite efficient and not too busy with the automated passport control.  Baggage collection took a bit of a wait, but nothing too out of the ordinary.

The departures lounge for a weekday early afternoon flight was somewhat more chaotic.  Security was quite intense, cramped and with many people needing extra security or baggage checks the area after the x-ray machines was very crowded with people waiting.  After security, the main waiting central area was also busy and there was hardly any seating available.  You needed to go closer to the gates to get any peaceful seating, however the areas nearer to the gates have no facilities whatsoever and you need to return back if you want anything including toilets or a drink.  Terminal 1 has some eateries and shops but not a great variety, and many of the food outlets seemed quite busy with lines.",3
Queue at security. But from arriving at T1 to check in then  entering the departure lounge was 55 minutes. Better than some previous visits.,3
"It’s widely known locally it’s a badly managed airport, poorly trained staff, old infrastructure (except Terminal 2) and not working systems here and there. This is one of the bad asset management examples. It’s a shame. People deserve a better airport.",1
"Great clean and organized airport. Wonderfull atmosphere, a relaxed place to end a month abroud and have a decent meal.",5
"The busy easyjet checking soon went down I did however find one particular security woman very snippy when i happened to remark that I've flown all over and never once been told to put my asthma inhalers in a plastic bag. No big deal I was just saying off the cuff remark but she seemed to take particular unbridge at it . ""  Well you do here !""
Noted , I know better than to argue with with security,  as I'm one myself. I would never speak to my passengers like that.
On the way back was a doddle passport control great we used the EGates bags arrived on belt  within 15min just ashame the travel walkways were not working.",4
"Good location overall, no shortage of parking (of mixed quality), and well supported by many hotels.
We have found check in (various airlines, mainly Jet2) and security to be very speedy, but the air-side facilities to be pretty underwhelming.

Anecdotally, we've heard even aircrew be dismissive of the design and layout of the place. It seems like too much space given to lots of retail and hospitality outlets, but haphazard arrangement and lack of seating/general space spoil the experience. Even at 0500hrs on a summer's Monday, I wasn't impressed in any way. I'd hate to suffer it on a Saturday or Sunday.

A reminder, if you chose Manchester airport, that you are often utterly at the mercy of the motorway gods as to when you arrive there. We were subject to a 4 hour delay southbound the day prior to our flight. That'd have been a horror had it been the day of our departure.",3
"Worst Airport I’ve been in Europe. Considering that this is UK, security staff are very slow. Took me 30mins to pass through the security. Technology is so outdated. Staff should go, observe and learn from their neighboring countries. Welcome to this First World Airport! 😆😆😆",1
"Easy to get to by train, which is a short walk to terminal 1. Very quick and efficient check in and security. I used the fast track, which was excellent. Lots of shops and restaurants in the waiting area whilst awaiting a gate number.  Free WiFi for 4 hours. Good viewing windows to watch planes take off.  There is a free water fountain to refill your water bottle, after you have emptied it for going through security, but its a bit hidden, its on the way to the downstairs toilet, but is not signposted of the main corridor, I only found it when going to the toilet. When you arrive there is an option of Terminal 1 departures A or B, which is confusing as neither was mentioned on my ticket, it just said Terminal 1. The floor could do with a more frequent/thorough clean.",5
"Manchester Airport seems to have become pleasant to travel through again. Going out there were no queues at security and new scanners were in use, no delays. Coming back only a short queue at passport control and amazingly bags were on the belt when we got there for the first time in years",4
"Restaurant queues were big and slow... And £16+ahead plus drinks a pint is about £6-7.  Must be a hard wheel chair and pushchair to get about so many lifts to use and not all working, travillators not working, signage for T1 wasn't clear and a few of us went the wrong floor.  It's an ok place but nothing more.  My image is from the window seat which is the best and only about 7 of them",3
"A nice airport, well kept. Friendly and very helpful staff.
The reason for our low rating was because of the absolute rip off carparks, I went to drop my son off and to make sure that he knew where he was going etc
3 hours in the multi-storey cost me £30
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Tell me how that can be justified",2
"Manchester, so much to answer for!

Plus points: Easy links from the city centre and going between terminals is a short indoor walk. Flying in October and November, the queues were not problematic for entry to the airport or through security for late morning or afternoon flights. I flew from T1 which has a smoking area, the others don’t. Train station is easy to find and get to. Water point is just through security which is good, you don’t need a treasure map to find it (I’m looking at you Liverpool John Lennon airport!!). Generally speaking the airport staff are helpful and nice, really down to earth and friendly.

Cons: The electronic walkway escalator things aren’t on when using the sky bridges. T1 is a bit of a dump. Poor food choices: bar mcr has nothing available and the grain loft is a rip off. Giraffe is being refurbished but it’s been closed for months. Departures A and B are confusing, why not be clear from the signage which airline covers which area? There’s no real signage for what eateries are available; they shouldn’t be secret venues, it shouldn’t be a scavenger hunt for cafe Nero or Greggs now should it.",3
"The worst airport I have ever been too (from over 70 airports I have seen until now). Plan a lot of time before to come here (especially terminal 3). The efficiency of the processes is worse than in Asia and Africa, the employees do not posses the abilities to do their job, the manager should be fired immediately. Security check takes 45 minutes.",1
"Most inefficient and worst managed
security, takes an age for every bag and they select almost every bag for extra checks. Your job is to stop a terrorist not fish out a chapstick somebody has left in their bag.... lots of staff wandering around aimlessly and one person on bag checks....",1
"Having spent an unplanned extra day out of the country I paid an additional parking fee which was totally acceptable. I requested an additional receipt at the barrier for my payment and was told it would be emailed to me within two hours. Five days later - STILL WAITING.

Customer service - They simply don't not what it is!",1
Absolutely no issues from arrival to departure and in return. Great service. Staff were great and no delays. Departure was 0835 and landed 2005 back with Qatar. No issues at all.,5
Absolute joke of a place. Staff is useless and extremely rude. No one has any knowledge of international travel law. Only 10% of security lanes are open. They check almost everyone’s bags with no reason. Slow on purpose. Staff is just walking around with their hands in their pockets. Look at the pic with their stats from earlier today. Dont ever go to that airport. If you have an option use Liverpool or Leeds or any other airport.,2
"Worst airport I’ve ever been through. Overcrowded. At max capacity any time of the year. Security is a total nightmare. 35mn to go through, waiting time not included. Every single bag gets selected for screening, no wonder it takes ages. Rude and intrusive security staff.
Oh and lounges are at max capacity too, so if you wanted to relax after all this, you won’t be able to!!!
Destination is not displayed at the gate (see photo). No indication at all about speedy boarding line vs normal line…
Avoid MAN airport at any cost!",1
Really easy access from the Airport to the centre.  Only a 15-20 min away Door to door by train. Fun night out.,4
I love it 🇬🇧🥰😍very easy to travel and The immigration staff is very kind,5
My first experience through Manchester Airport was pleasant. Having parked at the local Crowne Plaza it was only a 5 minute walk to the terminal. Security and passport control was swift coming in and out of the airport. Not much retail outlets avaliable in Terminal 3 but enough to suffice. I would fly from here again.,5
"The airport was busy and the staff were rude. If you don’t like your job then get another one, but do not be rude to travelers just because you have an I’ll fitting uniform and think you can. Otherwise it’s actually a handy airport when visiting northwest UK.",2
"Another big airport but easy to navigate.
Used T2 which was easy to get to from the parking lot.

Long queues at the bag drop on day of travel but to be expected as it was summer time.
Not easy to find help at this airport.

There were sufficient shops and eateries.

Parking available at affordable prices.

Could do with more assistance around. Can get complex with it's size.",3
"2 stars as it is close to my home and flys to the destination I wanted. Other than that...... terminal 2 being renovated and opening next year. Walkways switched off although no visible work being done. Security staff rude . Shouting, abrupt, finger waving and some just speaking to customers in a way that beggars belief. These are my observations and am not writing the review after being on the receiving end of the abuse. Just felt it needed airing.",2
"Continually awful, well done Manchester airport. Never have buses available for scheduled flights, slow security and clearly poor communication between airlines and ground crew.",1
"The part-refurbished T-2 departures is much improved, however, the arrivals side is still scruffy, the walk from plane to immigration is around 500 meters and the luggage took 50 minutes to get to the belt!",2
"This airport is a nightmare. If you can fly from somewhere else do it. Especially stressful is security - I don’t understand the stress you create by shouting at people to go through and then nitpicking their baggage.  Being a frequent flyer from different airports in the country, yours is the worst. Overly self righteous on security, and treat people like cattle. It’s also pretty small and doesn’t have a lot of amenities nor seating areas.",2
"Horrible Airport that's not organised at all. Took me over half an hour to find a parking space. No spaces anywhere, cars dumped all over the car park and no one seems to care. It was very difficult to drive around the car park as people have been leaving their cars absolutely everywhere. Staff don't seem to care, all they're bothered about is the drop of point outside where they only allow taxis to stop. Due to the fact I couldn't find a parking spot for over half an hour I had to pay £12 quid for the pleasure of driving around their ridiculous car park 🤦. If you can then fly from Liverpool, a lot better airport with proper car park and drop off point. I will not be returning to Manchester Airport.",1
Had to check in T1B but then had to walk back to T1A to go through Security. Prepare to walk a lot with the closures! Security was pure chaos. Staff shouting and hearing travelers like cattle. Waited 20 minutes after we went through the metal detectors to have our children's bags searched. Thankfully the staff searching the kids bags were friendly with them to make the situation a bit better.,3
"Checked in online, pretty quick through security 15 mins. Don't forget we're still on the plastic bag with 100ml max until next year. Had brunch at Trattoria Milano which was lovely.",5
"Love Manchester Airport especially Terminal 2 now they've done it up however I don't like security there as last year when I flew to Barcelona with Jet2 I had to throw nearly all of my toiletry products away like my shampoo and shaving foam and I know that's the rules but it annoyed me

Other than everything else was absolutely brilliant!!! 🤩💙✈️👍🏻🙏🏻",5
"First time flying from Manchester and with a mobility scooter. I was not asked any security questions so didn't know my mobility scooter emergency charger needed to be declared. As a result, Manchester Airport has thrown it out. It was an expensive piece of kit. Rude and unhelpful staff. I will be putting a claim in as this has caused a lot of issues with the scooter and resulted in having to buy another and spend a lot of holiday money I shouldn't have had to spend.",1
"Lots of walking necessary from arrivals to the exterior, car parks, station; travelators all shut down; confusing signage; up and down stairs; bit of a nightmare tbh as a 'senior person'.
Stopped for breakfast at 'Hangar' in T1 (I think!) and managed to interrupt the serving person's personal conversation with her friend just long enough to make an order. Could just about make myself heard over the loud music - got it turned down to 'background ' level. Coffee average; full breakfast expensive methinks. Advert for 'Mile High Muffin' - if you know you know. Not funny.
Rant over.",3
"Bÿ far the worse airport in the world.
It's so shocking it's nearly funny.
However missing two flights because of their appallingly slow security isn't funny.
Obnoxious,arrogant and totally disinterested staff,however,combined with the large daily contingency flying east (who still have no idea whatsoever about the ridiculous liquid rule) then it's a disaster every day.
You'll need three hours not two and that's without hold luggage.
And then there's the never ending up and down stairs to different gates in T1....
Like an Escher painting.
If you can fly from Liverpool then please do.you won't regret it.",1
"Brilliant airport we arrived on the train which is very handy. We missed the signs for departures  somehow at terminal 3, as we only hand luggage. Eventually found it. Be prepared for a walk depending on what terminal you are visiting. Don't forget to use the lifts.",4
Terminal 2 is new so it is very nice when we last flies there were lots of facilities and check in security was quick and efficient. On the other hand terminal 1 and 3 aren't the nicest and it takes about an hour to get through security .,4
"Looking very dated now and always looking scruffy. Either the cleaners need to up their game (which I doubt) or MAA need to hire more cleaners (most likely won't as that cuts into profits).

A lot of airports have a free 15 min or even 1 hour (Exeter airport) pick up for disabled passengers. Not MAA. £5 for 5 mins an absolute travesty but we have to pay it as there is nowhere near to drop a disabled (or able-bodied) person off to go on holiday.

Once inside it is still very lacking..Untidy, unsmiling service staff and not enough seats for everyone in T3. But, you're only there (hopefully) for a few hours.",2
"I have been a regular user of Manchester Airport for years but recently received a fine in the drop off area for vehicle abandonment, the excessive £100 fine for helping a friend carry her bag to the doors is insane and intended to extort money out of unknowing visitors. The complaints section of the website does not work and the staff were rude and unhelpful. I am hugely disappointed as a regular user of the airport who will not return.",1
"Used the new T2 for the first time, much much better than the old one, nice environment, through security in 10 minutes and friendly team too. I feel there aren’t enough places to get a drink, lots of queues to enter so needs additional locations, but there are a decent selection. Toilets feel small too. But a significant improvement overall",4
"I've read so much negative feedback about this airport that I have to share my experience.
Arrival was extremely swift and painless, we literally were past the customs check in about 10 minutes; after that, we easily found our way to the train station and that was it.
Departure was also almost hassle-free. Baggage check did take a bit of time, but for the rest nothing to complain: the waiting hall was crowded but there was more available seating upstairs with view on the runway, the boarding procedure was extremely swift, toilets were clean... all in all, everything went smoothly. Cheers!",4
"Good grief, what a terrible experience. I spent longer queuing around the airport than my flight took in the air. No baggage drop off for Aer Lingus, so there's no point in checking in early online. Security A was closed so they sent us to Security B, which closed as we approached. They sent us back to Security A. My unproblematic bag got shuffled off to an entirely different aisle (not even the one ""next to"" my aisle), so I was waiting pointlessly for ages for it to appear. Thank goodness for the kindness of strangers. I recommend that you fly from Liverpool.",1
"One of the worst in Europe for the passengers. I am flying from this airport from 15 years, sometimes few times monthly. It use to be perfect 5 years ago than going down year by year. FIRST you need  to walk miles between the terminals along the elevators which before covid were stopped and they never put them again pretending that some work on them is going on.
2.The escalators tram-bus station rearly work.
3. Getting to the  airport by car or  taxi is on additional charge of £6 for  30min. Same to drive out.
4. Long ques  on the security check. Usually few from many lanes are in action.
5.No any waiting place for  the transit passengers except few seats on the bus station, many of them broken .
The only good thing is the station where you  can get bus,tram or train to any part of the country.",2
Awful airport heightened by the appalling security staff who think they run a gulag the way they patronise and bark at people. Use smaller local airports if you can. Also eating and drinking there is a rip off.,1
"Manchester Airport provided us with a poor experience in September 2022. As an international airport which is obviously popular and important in the UK, they should have done better than this. The passenger conveyor was not working at all. Although the airport was not dirty, they had many people in both Terminal 2 and Terminal 3. The security checkpoint was a mess, you needed to wait a long time to get your personal belongings and there was no order, sequence, or good service. We saw they were training new staff, which probably explained why the work efficiency was pretty low. When we came back we arrived in Manchester as well. This time our luggage was delayed without notice in advance, so all of us from the same plane needed to wait for another hour and a half. Suitcases of other people were everything - lost or waiting for pick up. A lady from our plane said in April she arrived at Manchester Airport and it already looked like this. Apparently, they do need some improvement and development. If you are traveling via Manchester Airport, please take care of yourself.",2
"There is a reason Manchester airport always makes the worst airports list. Sadly for customers there is nothing to be done but complain. We arrived after a nine hour flight from Barbados and made our way through the airport to the baggage pickup without incident. After 40 minutes of waiting the baggage finally started to arrive. By this time two other flights had landed and I felt sorry for the wait those passengers faced. Except those passengers started to see their luggage and started to leave the airport. After 1.15 minutes I had had enough and looked for an office to complain. I went to an office I guessed was a third party operator and asked if they worked for the airport. The person was clearly having a bad day as they felt the need to engage me despite not working for the airport. I can only guess he had experienced a long history of irate customers taking their frustrations out on him, as he was really in the mood to put me down. I refused to engage and on my 5th time of asking where the office was he finally indicated the other side of customs. This whole episode speaks of a poorly ran airport with poorly trained workforce who lack motivation. In my career I have always been the senior person on site and the blame always lies with the one in charge. Without doubt sitting in their plush office, detached from the realities on the ground for customers and staff.",1
"I flew out yesterday. I felt so worried and stressed on the way to the airport because of what has been on social media about the airport. No queues outside the terminal. Check in desks opened exactly 3 hours before take off and queue moved quickly. Security was not so bad. Staff were handling it very well. I would like to thank you big for the multi faith prayer room at gate 20 and if you are looking for perfection, I suggest adjusting the toilets for ablution.",5
"One of the worst airport terminals (#2) I have ever been to. Disjointed, no one available to help. There's  an absolutely awful trolley system in Terminal 2 about half a mile walk inside that costs a £1 coin. If you've got a lot of luggage without wheels you'll get a good work out in. Oh, and don't mind all the construction that renders the escalators useless.",2
"We flew with Emirates. They now have a lane for online check-in, and that's so much quicker. I use airport assistance, and my hubby pushes the wheelchair, so there's no waiting. The special assist lanes are a bit quicker, and they usually give you a good security check. It's a busy airport, but great to see they've expanded the seating areas. Many shops, eateries, and a good duty-free section. A smoking area for those who need it. Parking is best done online for good deals. We've prebooked and stayed at the Clayton Hotel  the night before with parking for a good deal.",5
"I travel regularly throughout in Europe and must say this is one of the worst airports . Not sure how other people could rate this airport as modern and efficient . Looking at the faces of other people I don’t see really anybody who was enjoying it there.
I was at T3

This primarily due to:

- Extremely inefficient security checks. Sure people bring the wrong stuff in their hand luggage but what I have seen there is madness. Really even it is a super super  small tube of hand cream you have to take it out otherwise you will be pulled over to the security screening desks where you will easily 30min or more. Install newer models of scanner machines like in other airports reducing the workload and specifically being more efficient with less personnel

- Personnel at the security check are inefficient and are using their authority in a wrong way. Looks like are enjoying it having a sort of control over people . Yes the security is important but it doesn’t help when the people who work there behave like little dictators. As well at the security screening table some of them try to be a teacher and lose a lot of time talking.

- Fast Track isn’t really fast track and I must say I would have been faster without it. Basically the fast track is mixed at the security check lane with non priority travelers. 5 people can be there at the same time, 3 fast track and two non fast track

I can’t avoid this airport but pls be aware of the extremely inefficient security checks and specifically people who work there .",1
"Poor signage.
Old terminal for easyJet like being in third world country.
Parked on runway for 20mins before docking when returning with jet2.
Portable stairs took ages to arrive.
Baggage reclaim was half an hour. Poor service for such a big airport.",3
"Compared to London airports, Manchester is a dream to get to. We travelled from Birmingham in a little over an hour. It is well set out and not as daunting to navigate round as bigger airports can be. Expensive short stay car park (£12 for 1 hour) but aren't they all?! The Terminal 1 car park we used is literally across the road from the terminal and was deserted when we arrived. Don't know if it was empty because of the pandemic or the prices or a bit of both. Would definitely fly from there again. Plenty of overpriced hot food /drink concessions..... I suggest a W. H. Smth meal deal. Happy travels. 👍🏻😎✈️",4
"Still so very slow to get through Security compared to other airports I frequent. Would also be super useful to have the Flight Boards details (Gate No, time showing delay etc) online or as part of an app.",3
"Had a Special Assistance passenger. Staff were generally helpful. Place was clean and quiet. Staff on conveyor belts hated their jobs, but once I mentioned I'd not flown in the time they'd been alive, they calmed and were more helpful.",5
"Firstly, be careful, the security staff were caught putting stuff in our luggage… when we complained we were treated like criminals by staff. When we complained we were told if we did we’d be escorted from the airport!!! Lock your cases folks because the “internal risk” at Manchester is high….
Secondly, T2 is unfinished and T3 has no facilities to speak of, and no smoking area.
As a weekly traveller I can honestly say this is the worst airport in the UK, if not the whole of Europe.",1
"The Manchester Airport is a very busy international Airport that connects to other parts of the world. The airport is big, neat and has three (3) terminals that are interconnected. It is a transport hub that serves different airlines and passengers to so many destinations. A lovely place.",5
"My last 3 flights have been delayed due to problems at the airport unrelated to airlines. Security and baggage handling are completely inadequate and appear to be getting worse.

For a 0600 departure from terminal 1 I arrived at 2:30 and had to queue for an hour outside the terminal and then at every next step. Despite getting accelerated twice by pleading with staff directly we still nearly missed the flight.

On the return leg my baggage was delayed by 2 hours with the bags being placed on a random carousel with no associated announcement.

I strongly recommend not to use Manchester  unless they make drastic improvements",1
Lovely airport. T2 has works going on at the moment. Good transport connections. Not much in the way of places to Eat in T1 but a good range in T2,4
"Arrival at Terminal 1.
Right there is WHSmith, SPAR and Costa as you exit.
and at 5 minute walk, you can buy Parking Spot from JustPark and Manchester Clayton Airport Hotel.
Immigration is quick.
I was able to receive my friend, 45 minutes after their flight landed. They didn't have British/European Passport either.",5
"Excellent airport, but terminal 2 is a trap! We traveled in early August, didn’t have an adea that dropping off in terminal 2 is such expensive!! After my husband dropped us then at the end he has paid 25£ just for dropping us in-front of the terminal 2 gate! And there was  no clear sign to show that charges applied is 25£! I understand that in every airport every things price is expensive and one should pay double and triple for everything. But there should be a sign or information before that. Not at the end you surprise by it.",4
"The checkin process for emirates was very slow (nearly 90 mins) with 2 staff checking majority of the non online checked in passengers.  there could have been more emirates crew staff to have better facilitated the process.  The security check was however very quick.  The airport corridors could be kept more clean, toilets were well maintained.",3
"Jobsworths during security make this place an awful experience. The family route is a joke, on entry they feed ineligible people to get yelled at for being in the wrong place, and on departure they harass everyone universally. Queues back up due to unnecessary pulling apart of hand luggage and over zealous interpretations of law.

My job means I frequently fly all over the world and this is the only airport I was ever compelled to write a review for. It’s like they watched a video of what an airport is and decided that was all they needed to know.

One year we cancelled coming back to England due to strikes at the airport, but we shouldn’t have. According to the news, the military did a better job of running it than the regular staff 😄",1
Awful getting through baggage and then through security.  Queues were mental.  No idea why security is so different across the UK - stricter about what constitutes a liquid at mss at Manchester than others.  Security ‘scanner’ was rejecting almost 50% of people. Some individuals were able to go through security without any scans at all because they were with what looked to be a pilot. So what?  Being with a pilot doesn’t mean a passenger should be able to avoid security.  Duty free wasn’t that great.  Bargains are not the same anymore.  That walkway to the terminal is not suitable for older people or those less able and the moving walkways were not…moving!,2
"What a horrific experience, every single time. Such a big airport, serving one of the biggest city in the UK.
I travel a lot, mainly for work, and although I live near Manchester, I have been trying to depart from ANYWHERE ELSE but Manchester for the past few months. After they have renewed some terminals, the experience is still the same, starting from the insane security queues, where they stop travellers for anything they deem not compliant, because it seems their xrays cannot detect items too accurately, so out of safety they stop customers regardless. At least this was the excuse last time they stopped my carry on, and after messing up my bag for no reason and told me ""you can leave now"", I asked what the issue was THIS time, they just shrugged their shoulders and without even an apology they gave me the excuse above.
There is charge of around 5 pounds to drop off and pick up travellers, even if you transit for less than 1 minute.
The inbound is no better, a healthy 3 flights of stairs not long after getting out of the plane - with no lift or escalator options - and with a carryon and a leg not functioning great, it's no fun. Then one of the most horrific queue ever seen in an airport for passport control. There was only one lane open, that was going all the way down forever, no criteria whatsoever, the signs were ignored and all passports were merged into the same huge queue. I had to run to the trains, which are another healthy 10 minutes walk away, where none of the moving walkways were working!
I had a full hour between coming out of the plane and my train, and I managed to hop on it one minute before it left! After hopping and sweating beyond end.
I really hope that someone will eventually take charge of this beautiful airport and makes it work to at least its basic functions soon. We are all happy that travels have resumed, coming through this airport though makes you almost want to stay home!",1
"Consistently a bad experience with security at MAN airport. I decided to pay for fast track this time. The fast track queue was longer than the normal queue. Then my hand luggage had a “bad scan”; leading to a 30/40 minute wait for my bag to get checked by security and re ran through the scanner. They didn’t even need to search it. Surely ye can flag bad scans and fly them through again, and not make the customer wait.",1
"It was pretty much empty, which made a pleasant change. Our flight landing at 13.10. The only minor niggle was a long wait for our bag and the 'Drop & Go' bus (we'd just missed one) and had to wait nearly 10 minutes.",5
"T2 doors through flight transfer did not open. After 20 tries by 3 staff member we got through after 15 minutes.  Security check lines declined my passage due to an essential hatch key in my luggage. They were about to usher me out to baggage dropoff if it were not for a benevolent employee who understood my plight an let me through to go to my gate. Despite this, it's easy to find one's way around this tidy unassuming airport.",3
"As its the country's busiest hub outside the capital, its always hard  good to see that most of the time staff are very frirndly and try your best to help you. Sadly, it lets the side down when it comes to airport parking. Loading and picking up can be very expensive, especially if you need luggage trolleys, or have say, elderly people with walking difficulties. Also the road system can be hard to navigate.",4
"A place to start your hollibobs travel. Still work In progress, maybes one day it will get 5 stars",3
"Dont risk the food in terminal 3
food areas  - rodent infested.
Apart from that  better than many airports",2
"Does a job.
When quiet it's fine,  but too often over crowded.
Service at shops etc ok. No more.
No particular reason why we should over pay for food and drink other than we are trapped and have no choice.
Parking prices ridiculous bordering on the abusive.",3
"That's what happens if you don't behave, said the woman in the hi-vis  to some strangers that she had never met, a typical manchester airport greeting. Best would be to close it down and send people to other airports!",1
"Over 30 minutes in security because they had apparently never seen a tripod before. They made people take (solid) chapstick out of their bags. They were rejecting virtually every other bag for the most ludicrous reasons. Is this 2002?

I had to get my passport and boarding pass scanned four separate times, and two of those were 30 ft. from each other. The mobile boarding pass was not working at any scanner.

Hands-down the most inefficient and laughable security process I’ve ever encountered at any airport.",1
"The worst airport I use, their treatment of disabled people is a disgrace.
They pushed us in a wheelchair to a flight of stairs and then looked at us stupidly..
4th  time now that i have used Manchester Airport's so called accessible service they should.be ashamed.",1
Omg terminal 1. Security so poor and my coat and mobile phone tray was moved onto the repack area by someone as my other 3 trays were 10 trays behind as security officer was talking dl much to hid colleague that he held my trays whilst others went thru the xray !!,3
Took almost an hour just to check into my airline. I tried to use the machine (as I do back home) but the airline attendant said that I can’t use the machine unless I have a boarding pass. 🤔😣 Security wasn’t that bad though - on the other side in less than 10min. Decent food options and shopping. The JD Sports store was cool and very tempting. 👟 Didn’t get a chance to go to the lounges - by that time the board was saying go to the gate. Would have liked to see a couple more food options near the gate but this is how they do it - just need to plan better for next time. Cheers!,4
"Simply the worst airport regardless of what airline you are flying.  The check in is notoriously slow, gates are miles away and the repeated boarding pass scans will make you want to jump out of a plane.  Aer Lingus at this airport is horrid. Do yourself a favor and fly into London and train it. It will be faster and cheaper - and you will be less frustrated than I am now.",1
I cannot leave 0 stars. Worst airport in Europe. 30 min to get 10 people through security in the fast track. Some gates are literally containers where people are left like cattle.,1
Parking is disgustingly expensive and they even charge you for dropping people off which is nothing short of extortion because if you want to fly you have no choice but to drop people or park and this is even extended to Taxi's who simply add it to your fare. Those who control Manchester Airport hold ALL and I mean ALL their customers to ransom over parking and ig makes no odds if it is Long Term or Short Term parking either!,2
£6 fees for picking up and dropping off disgusting. The car parks are very busy as well. Went in the wrong pick up zone tried turning back was told there would be an immediate fine of £100 if I did so I had to still pay £6 to leave then another £6 into the car park for few minutes. What a money racket. It never used to be like this there were bays you could park and pick up for free for few minutes.,1
"I arrived by train, and it's easy to access all 3 Terminals from the Station. Terminal 3 is the furthest away, a 12 minute walk, partly under cover.
If you're a smoker, your last chance to have a cigarette is outside the Terminal building.
Security was fairly rapid, but I was surprised that I had to put my lighter in the liquids bag. That's a first!
Unfortunately, it now gets worse. The duty free, and shops/bar area is one of the smallest I've ever been in. Limited food and drink options, which are exorbitantly expensive. Most people opted for KFC, including me, which seemed reasonable enough at £10.29 for a meal in a box plus drink. Beer not too bad at £5.50 a pint for Carlsberg.
However, you have to pay £2.50 to use the cash machine, £2 for a bar of chocolate, and £4 for a cup of coffee at Costa. I looked around the Tech Shop, and my advice would be don't bother. Out of this world prices for adaptor plugs, which you can buy elsewhere for a couple of quid. It's blatant profiteering and should be illegal.
So,in summary, I'd advise making sure you don't need to make last- minute purchases and take your own food if you think you will need to eat.
I'll be avoiding Manchester Airport in future.",1
Its a world class airport. It has three terminals and it is massive. It has almost every kind of facility which a world class airport should have.,5
"Multi storey car park at terminal 3 completely full ended up driving round 3 times before realising that there was an ""overflow"" carpark outside at ground level. Still not sure if we are okay to park there as absolutely zero signage.
Only 1 water tap to fill the a bottle for the whole terminal and no soap in the gents toilet.",2
"Recently visited Manchester Airport Terminal 2 and had a fantastic experience. The place is well-organized, clean, and offers a great range of amenities. The staff was helpful, and the overall atmosphere was pleasant. Will definitely consider using this terminal again for future travels.""",5
"I'm a Mancunian and it pains me to leave this review .
I travel back periodically as I travel for work worldwide
This airport is one of the worst I've encountered anywhere.
Badly laid out.
Woefully lacking in enough facilities for the passenger numbers transiting.
Staff look like they'd rather be ANYWHERE else .

Only one highlight: the lady on information desk in T1 arrivals ( blonde short hair ) ....the saving grace of the entire place .
She is lovely.

I fully understand why it's voted the worst UK airport  .",2
"Dreadful. One of the worst airports in the world. Get there early to enjoy the full experience of queuing at security for 90 minutes then queue for a tasteless sandwich before finally boarding your plane in the nick of time to leave this awful place behind.

*UPDATE* if you fly out of T2 its slightly better.",1
Swift check-in and thorough with checks. Overall a good experience even though our flight was delayed so ended up getting some lovely pizza from the freshly baked section and desert at one of the cafes.,4
One and a half hour wait for my bag to appear on the carousel at baggage reclaim along with the bulk of passengers on my flight. None of the half dozen of so travelators from terminal 2 to the station were working which they weren't a year ago.,1
Honest review. Late October Terminal 1. First class passage through the processes. No delays with EasyJet great experience.,5
"What an absolute nightmare.
Seriously considering not flying from Manchester anymore and travelling further to fly from now on.
The queues are massive and you can over hear the staff saying how people didn't need to be sent to all these places.
Got sent to the baggage check and majority of people on the queue didn't need to be there.
Then made it to security and its absolute bedlam and people are getting delayed and checked for absolutely no reason.
Got to the airport 3 hours before as you should for international travel and I literally had 5 minutes before I got on the plane.

What an absolute joke!",1
"Manchester terminal 1 has improved since I was last there, the security hall has had it's suspended ceiling removed making the whole space far better and the number of staff was in line with the number of customers. The terminal offerings were also good. Great improvement.",5
"The airport was very busy.no problem getting through security with fast track
Well worth paying £6.00 I was through with in 10 minutes. the airport is very clean. All the shops were busy. did not wait long to be served in the ones I went in",5
"I cannot recommend travelling from here, it's outdated, uncomfortable and there never seems enough staff on. The signage advising what needs to be removed from bags for screening is non existent. Better preparation for a journey makes it more pleasant.",2
"There’s generally too much wrong but I’ll give it ago.
Checkin - I’m silver so it was quick - that’s about the only highlight
Security - I mean it’s abysmal. I’ve never been processed by a more rude, aggressive, impolite and sad looking crew than Manchester airport security. I was shouted at for not putting other people’s trays in the bin. Even though I was the one clearing the aisle so it could flow. it’s always terrible. The staff are always aggressive or act in a begrudging way.
The lounge is fine but the food selection is quite poor. Now I know this isn’t Manchester airports fault but the lounges are an extension of the experience. It get one star for food variety.
So boarding - it’s chaos. People in wheelchairs just being left - I ended pushing a guy because I was in the priority boarding lane. Which goes slower than the general lane. First and business stuck behind a massive queue of wheelchairs with no one to push them. Again boarding the plane is comically inept. First / business and platinum gold and silver can’t see clearly so they come in dribs and drabs.
Skywards gold should get priority boarding but they don’t - they get more or less forgotten.
When you compare Manchester to Newcastle. It doesn’t compare. The north east is so much more friendlier and organized. It’s not anywhere near the league of a Dubai or Singapore. All in all I’ll do my best to avoid it because it’s always a poor experience and the security staff are rude. Fair play to the other staff. They are not rude they are just unorganized",2
"Good choice of restaurants,  now has new technology so you don't need to empty your hand luggage of your electronics or liquid.
Still check-in needs improving",4
The airport is build very well. Excellently organized and well maintained. But the problem is with the planes 🛫 which are too louder 🤔,4
The point outside the departure entrance for assistance was out of order and by thr look of the notice on the button to summon assistance had been for some time . I had to go to enquiries then take the lift to the 1st  floor where I found it. I was then taken to an area to wait to be taken to the gate . The person who had been allocated to take me there did not turn up and as my flight was due to close the lady who was in charge of the area took me to get my flight.. I think the staff of the assistance service although all very pleasant and kind (. Except the young lady who did eventually arrived to take me to the aircraft and was telling he colleagues she had not got home until 6am and was still hung over ) need to go to Alicante Airport to observe how a  very excellent service is run.,3
"A thoroughly unpleasant experience from start to finish. Rude check in staff, long queues for oversize baggage, ridiculous security overzealousness (had to wait 30 mins to requeue whilst thr cereal bar  in my hand luggage was thoroughly checked out, dirty toilets and coffee shop. If you can fly from somewhere else, do it.",1
A bit tired around the edges this airport with a tangle of desks and signs and barriers. Staff always pleasant and helpful although it’s not the speediest of places. Good few shops once through security and food including a costa.,5
"This airport used to be quite a decent one to fly from. M&G parking was easy to find, drop and collect keys. Since the new expansion and ongoing works the signage has been poor, difficult to find the right terminals and car parks, automated key lockers so nobody to ask when lost. The new T2 terminal building has potential when finished. Security is fast and easy, but more re-packing space is needed. Shopping is easy as your path from security takes you with no other choice through the high priced tax free shopping area. There's not much choice of sit-down affordable restaurants or cafes like T1. The gates are better designed, plenty of space and seats for just about a plane full of people. They could do with a few snack bars that end though for options when flights are delayed as it's a long walk back to the shops. Transport here would be good too like the shuttle buggy at Stansted.",3
"Way too busy,the popular airline Bryan Air are shocking 1st you queue to self check your bags in,which is a job in itself lol.once you have done that then you have to still queue to put your bags down chute thingy mi Bob... then security then passport check massive kerfuffle..no end of queueing. A very stressful day all round. Not greatly organised to be fair or it just doesn't feel it.soul destroying to say the least.
A very generous 3 stars only because you get on a plane at the end",3
Nice and cozy airport with lot of shops and facilities.,5
"We travelled with a disabled kid, and the staff at security were not helpful. They even put away the trays with our belongings while we waited on the other side to pass through the security arch.
In total, it took almost an hour (it was an evening flight and not particularly busy)",2
Slow and run down. In need of investment to be considered a desirable airport to fly through. Should look at Copenhagen as a benchmark.,2
Busy airport with lots of destinations. Terminal 2 now quite smart. Security variable queue lengths but decent today.,4
"So the new auto security gates don't work with children 1.25m tall, but there is no information to tell you that and you have to go out and back into the assistance queue! Fortunately we were early and the airport quiet. Other than that it went well",3
As a world traveller Manchester Airport is the worst in the world.  Terminal 1 security queues are slow have very little staff.  This airport needs significant improvement and proper leadership.,1
Very disorganised security check through. Quite disappointed to be honest. The airport seems dilapidated and worn down compared to few years ago when I passed through there.,3
"Hands down the worst airport I have been after traveling around.
People are sleeping on floors in night for early morning check ins there are no freaking chairs.
Peace of advice come in just 3hrs before your flight for international travel else be ready to sleep or sit on
the floor if it's in night.",1
"⭐⭐ Full Review

Update 03/02/2024
A recent visit to be picked up was charged £6 by the airport to come through the barrier to be picked up total time it tuck 4mins. Robbery.

*********
Since I started work abroad, i travel through Manchester Airport every few weeks.  I always experience several issues at Manchester Airport, especially Terminal 1. Signage to the airport is poor, and the cost for dropping off and picking up visitors feels like daylight robbery. Security queues resemble immigration lines, and walkways to planes are uncomfortably narrow. Food options are limited, and assistance from airport staff is hard to find. Inadequate charging points, subpar WiFi, and a fee for using trolleys add to the inconvenience. A 10-minute Uber taxi ride costs a staggering £22 during non-peak hours. The train system, especially in the evening, faces cancellations and delays, causing missed stops. My recent return included two cancelled trains and a failure to stop at my station. For an international airport, the overall experience is poor and embarrassing. Airport pictures on google are misleading#ManchesterAirport #Terminal1 #TravelWoes",1
"I agree with all the one star reviews. Worst airport I ever travelled been traveling International from the last 30 years never seen such incompetent staff. No clue what they are doing.

Giving a hard time to transit passengers.  Bathrooms in the terminal 2 after security is not clean.

Staff where rude and not polite  to so many passengers.

Security staff is so slow and we almost the last people to enter the aircraft because of so unorganized security.

We where traveling from Singapore to Houston transit via Manchester.

One thing for sure will not travel via Manchester airport in the future.",1
"Absolute disaster! How is it possible to have an airport so far gone. The organisation is atrocious and the traveller is never in mind. Travellaters are broken with no attempt to fix them, WiFi does not work, security takes for ever because of terrible organisation and not lack of staff.  Terrible experience avoid at all costs!",1
Seamless exit and entry of the country through Manchester Airport. Never had such trouble free use of an airport since Robin Hood closed.,5
"I want to express immense gratitude to a security officer (fast track) who ensured my mom didn't miss her flight. We arrived at Manchester Airport at the last minute due to a bus breakdown, and she was incredibly stressed. Without his help, she wouldn't have made it.

Not knowing his name, I hope to convey my gratitude through this review.",5
Terminal 2 greatly improved as is the west car park. The parking charges are extortionate. Manchester Airport should be ashamed. No signs indicating fees until you insert your token to find out you've been asked to pay £12 for 33 minutes. The lack of parking cost signs appears deliberate.,2
The Airport is a little bit complicated. But all in all okay,3
"Terminal 2 is a disaster of a design. Parts of it still under construction, but more of a shopping mall than terminal. Jam Packed with shopping, very little space for people to sit. More space for jewelery stores than bathrooms. Will absolutely avoid next time at all cost",1
Staff were very friendly and also it was nice and clean with good seating. There is a lot of parking available however they charge a high amount. It also includes a tram and bus stop allowing you to come to it. Our check in was quick and the staff helped us in to the plane. Our seats were comfortable and we had a small tv to use.,5
Beautiful airport but very spaced and when you get given the wrong information you walk 15min plus to have to turn and walk back. That plus fact there is no restaurants and limited seats at departure till you gone through is frustrating 😑 😒,3
"The most aggressive horrible security staff at this airport. Travelled a bit and everytime they are the same. It’s about time they put on their customer facing pants and stop hiding behind the fact they are security/immigration. No excuse. Also they lose your stuff and you never see it again.
Whole place is a shambles. Never had a flight go out on time in the last 6 years I’ve been.
Avoid and fly from elsewhere… it’s cheaper as well !",1
One of the worst airport in my experience. The staff is mostly friendly and that’s it. Security procedure is always complicated and takes a lot of time. The airport is far from being clean. In some gates (22-24 T1) it is extremely cold in the winter. Bad that such a great city as Manchester has the airport in such a poor condition:(,2
"Worst airport experience I’ve ever had. Arrived in good time even though the traffic mostly stayed still rather than move, the queue for security was unnecessarily long because they seemed to be understaffed( I prefer to believe they were understaffed rather than that they are so oblivious they just think it’s enough personnel). The personnel took their sweet time with everything, there was a problem with my backpack as I’d forgotten to take out my foundation and once they figured out that this was the problem they did not know what to do and had to wait for another more experienced lady to come and question me and tell them what is to be done. Needless to say, this lack of professionalism caused us to run as fast as we could through the airport as they only let us go to the gates 5 minutes before gate closing time. We will do our best from now on to avoid the Manchester Airport at all costs and advise you to do the same because with this kind of behavior you are not guaranteed to catch your flight.",1
"Pick up and drop off charges are monstrous and organised in such a way to guarantee you cannot pick-up or drop off quickly so they can charge you more yet Heathrow is a flat £5 with no time limit yet works do much better . Passport control and security checks are painful, I will fly from almost anywhere else to avoid this place.",1
"I got back from what ought to be ""developing"" countries and honestly, the UK airports are so far behind other places. Toilets are disgusting. Everything is grimy and dinghy. Baggage carousels are squeaky and outdated. I understand cuts and whatever else but someone is making a killing here at the expense of travellers' basic comforts.",1
T2 walkways and the arrivals baggage hall are dowdy with cramped toilet facilities and units not working. Compares poorly with tiled or marbled facilities in many poorer countries. Walkways to shorystay pickup area are poorly illuminated at night and uneven. £6 for a 2 minute pick-up is a complete scam. Shameful. Frequent cancellation of train connections into Manchester or to the north and poor rolling stock on the line create a poor impression of Britain.,2
Absolute joke of a place. Staff is useless and extremely rude. No one has any knowledge of international travel law. Only 10% of security lanes are open. They check almost everyone’s bags with no reason. Slow on purpose. Staff is just walking around with their hands in their pockets. Look at the pic with their stats from earlier today. Dont ever go to that airport. If you have an option use Liverpool or Leeds or any other airport,1
Lifts were out of action and inadequate signage on stairs route. Travellers wandering around not knowing where to go. 'Moving path ' in passage to station not working. Helpful staff at passport control.,2
"The airport security put me off ever returning to Manchester. Just total power trips and being unnecessarily pedantic, took a pistachio spread that I can only get here off me because 'it could go into a liquid's what?? Then unpacked my suitcase for straighteners, I've never had to take them out in any airport before. Flight was delayed the airport has no sleeping facilities or rest rooms. Also they charge for suitcase trolley.",1
"There are changes taking place, but signposts aren't very clear. Got through border control and baggage reclaim very quickly. Took us longer to find the bus stop to get to car park",3
"Returning home from holiday, greeted by Border force staff in denim jacket and hands in pockets, half the self scanners not working and no help or assistance.  Welcome to the UK. Almost an hour for the bags to come through not great.",2
"If you have a flight within the next 1-2 months and you're not already at the airport, you'll likely miss it.

If you have so much as a paperclip in your carry-on luggage, your bag will be thoroughly searched, along with 98% of other passengers.

Pack a lunch, a dinner, and maybe some change of address forms. You're going to be there awhile.",1
"After travelling to many cities around the world and just returning from 3 in Australia and then Dubai, it embarrasses me to return to Manchester airport. It is one of the dirtiest, disorganised and user unfriendly airports I have ever used. Not even the clock in passport control had been changed after a week of BST. What a first impression for foreign visitors.",1
Worst airport experience and I've travelled all over the world. Security is primitive and policies unlike any other airport. Making you pull out hair dryers and fitting all liquid carryon still into tiny plastic bag. No airport does this anymore. Lines are endless to go through security. Rude staff. Avoid!,1
"Probably one of the worst security control in  Europe international airports. Old fashion policy on liquids , extremely unfriendly., inefficient and  strict on unnecessary requirements not seen in any other airport meaning delays in access and bad user experience,",1
"Terrible, terrible airport. Fees for everything, moving walkways not working, poor signage, over worked staff (I saw 1 person having to push 3 passengers in wheelchairs to the lift!), terminals look dilapidated, food and drink overpriced and low quality.",1
"Signposting/way finding in the terminal wasn't clear after disembarking from the aircraft (Longanair) to collect my baggage at Manchester Airport.
No fault of the airline!!
Leaving the Airport, security weren't clear in their instructions and unnecessarily obnoxious. Wish I could say that this would be the first and last time
I would much prefer London airports,  Bristol, Exeter and Bournemouth Airports.",3
"T1 Drop Off and Collection
There are some pretty smart YouTube vids showing the routine.
Watch a recent one...as the road layout and procedure may change over time.
These de-mistify the whole process.

<< Feb 2024 >>
T1 - Drop Off
£5.00 for 5 mins parking in the herring-bone car slot. There looks to be 25 slots or so
Loads of restrictions... read the signs
More camera than GCHQ wardens everywhere.... rigged with ANPR
Don't chance it....
Example ""Pick up from Drop off £100 !!""
Pay on exit card / cash.
Take your glasses and a small lamp in low light levels I couldn't read a thing.!

T1 - Collection
£6.00 for 30mins.
£12.00 for 60mins.
Looks to be more 250 slots or so.
Again rigged with ANPR
Look on Mcr Airport live flight arrivals and take timings from there.
Hand baggage only  Landing time + 25 mins
Hold baggage.           Landing time + 40 mins

There is opportunity to remote park for free and get bussed in for free (I think) but we didn't use this so can't comment.
Bus frequency - Again unknown.",5
"2nd world airport, in particular terminal 1. No “levelling up” has occurred for this critical infrastructure of the NW. Gangway escalators turned off. Dirty floors and tables. Rubbish all around. No quiet spaces for passengers to relax and wait for their flights.
People who run this airport probably hide away in the lounges if they are travelling through here themselves.",1
"No accessible at all. I was there with a baby, 2 backpacks and a 2 piece pram, and I was told to go down stairs. I told them that there's no lift, and how I could go there on my own?  So I had no help from them at all.... Worst airport ever",1
"It’s a comparatively smaller International Airport in the UK. The immigration officials are thorough but quick. Process is smooth if you have proper documents. They make it much quick if you have right documents justifying your visit. If you are a non-UK passport holder, better carry a hard copy set of your return ticket, invitation letter, address of place of stay - hotel / friend and it will be real quick.  I felt that there weren’t proper signs in the airport to guide you outside. E.g. there are separate exists to reach Bus stop or taxi pickup point neither I could find any site map. There are few coffee shops and other express food counters inside arrival area. If you are waiting for your cab and don’t like the cold outside, SPAR medical shop is the landmark. Just wait for your cabbie indoors, outside SPAR entrance and he will locate you easily. From Arrival to parking you have to walk in open so at times rains are a bit challenging especially with luggage. There is a money changer at arrivals and also a taxi pickup & a booking point right outside. The staff of course is very cooperative & friendly.",4
"I've come here many many times as this is basically my local airport, and by local I mean about 40 miles away 😅. Anyway it is a good airport, quick services and as a result I easily could get to my gate for my flight. It is one of my favourite airports partly because I've been here so much",5
"Horrible airport. Why are UK airports on a such low standard? Flew in from GDN couple days ago and was met with a filthy and cold staircase leading to a very very long corridor full or barriers (lift not allowed to be used) , probably due to long queues this airport get to passport control.  Baggage at T3 is from the 80's, toilet facilities there zero to none, tiny, crammed and scruffy. Not a nice welcome into Manchester",1
"Outbound the airport seems to have sorted out the chaos caused by the pandemic & it was a pleasant experience. Arriving back was utterly appalling, corralled like sheep to get through passport control where 2 Border Force officials were in attendance for over 600 people lined up for nearly half a mile waiting to be processed. Shame on you Manchester Airport.",2
"I'm so impressed with the service at Terminal 2 and the fantastic modern facility. I approached the assistance team for a sunflower lanyard for my son, but they went so much further than that, proving extra support making travelling such a smooth process.",5
"Worst airport ever. Be prepared to walk for miles with in the airport. I literally walked 2 miles, pushing a baby stroller carry on bag and a diaper bag. Security will bully you if you’re not white. You can’t even bring milk for your toddler. The line at the security check point is ridiculously long.",1
"Official worst security airport! We were tricked by the airport security employee who took my sun cream from a famous and expensive brand without throwing the liquid in the bin as I requested. The employee badge wasn’t visible and she refused to say her name after refusing to show us throwing the sun cream liquid in the bin.

The context: Our bag was stopped due to a lighter that was forgotten inside the bag, when the procedure calls for it to be outside - which is a good reason to be stopped. However, for some unknown reason, the employee prevented us from continuing the trip with my suncream as she said that “the machine doesn't like the liquid” - which wasn’t the reason why they said they have stopped us firstly. Ironically, or not, the most expensive item of the liquids I was carrying. We asked why it was rejected but she couldn't explain neither had knowledge to sustain her version. We even asked to take a drug test in case it was a fear, but she refused. Also, she was very rude and simply confiscated my husband's mobile phone after asking to see his boarding pass and started using his phone inside the employee area, so we don't know why or what she has accessed. We've lived in the UK for 5 years, but she didn't understand our English (or pretended not to). She asked us several questions rudely and threatening if we didn't answer correctly she would confiscate our bag without stating the lawful order to give her power to do so. She took the sun cream inside a private room and later denied she did it. We received our bag back after almost 30 minutes asking for new sun cream test or at least the proper result from the first test, without success. Also, we asked for her to re-run the test in the mentioned machine to verify it and she just said she didn’t want to. As a recurring traveler the only one lighter always stayed in the same place and the lost sun scream never has been a problem - we travelled with the same suncream one week ago from the same airport. I lost an expensive and difficult-to-find product due to the employee's willingness to carry out legal tests and do her job. It’s important to mention that the first lady who did search the bag regarding the lighter was friendly, but they switched who was attending us and this second came rudely speaking. I asked for a formal report of this case and she just denied to give, apart of not giving her identification. And for those who say that perhaps she took this action because of the queues that airport security faces, here is a photo of how security was at 5 am this Thursday.",1
"There was hardly any officer on the ground to attend to enquiries. I had wandered the entire arrival/departure area before finding the helpdesk which is tucked behind the wall at the entrance. That is not to say that the signposts were confusing. Decent facility, nothing extraordinary. There are hotels within and around the complex. The highlight of my visit was discovering the Bus Station. It was such a relief! Was already trying to get a taxi when someone directed me there. I got a StageCoach bus from the bus station that took me to Piccadilly. It felt like a steal. Lol",3
"I had a pleasant experience for both arriving and departing from this airport. Everyone working here is polite and the security check is quick and efficient. The lounge in terminal 2 is comfortable and there are a lot of choices for pubs, restaurants.",5
"The toughest security checks in the UK, & the biggest queues as a result. Few places to eat and what there are, aren't good. Long queues normal there, too. They won't let you airside until 3h before your flight, and there's not much outside. Avoid if you have a choice.",1
"Rude and stubborn staffs at terminal 1 security check, belt 7, trying to humiliate you, maybe they should take a course in basic manners 🤷‍♂️",1
A disaster of an airport. Poorly laid out especially the new addition to T2. Drop off and pick up are a nightmare. Be prepared for a horrible start and finish to your getaway. The management have done their best to run down this airport over the years. How has it come to this?,1
"Ignore the media, we recently returned from holiday flying from and to Manchester airport for the first time, everything went completely smoothly and ran on time, we even arrived at our destination early.

The only negative and the reason I remove a star is because the security is very old fashioned and there’s manual searches of our bags which is annoying and makes it feel very outdated.

Personally I found the staff were very friendly, some appeared tired and just didn’t have the energy to go around smiling all the time, I thank the staff at Manchester airport and understand how much pressure they are under when the place is understaffed

We also had a wheelchair and the assistance was very good, it’s our first time travelling this way so we were a little anxious but now we’re so relieved and look forward to our next trip from MCR airport

We used to live close to Heathrow in London and travelled a lot from the various airports there too, we always want to be close enough to a major airport for our travels and would say from experience that this airport is about as good as Heathrow apart from the manual bag searches.

It’s no wonder they had problems with queues if they have to perform bag searches the way they do, all they need to do to solve that is upgrade the machines at security

However, we fortunately didn’t experience any queues on our trip.

Thank you Manchester airport",4
"The newly renovated Manchester airport is truly impressive, with a few minor drawbacks that may need attention. Unfortunately, the car park fees are quite expensive, and there could be some improvements in providing clearer directions to the designated car park area.",5
"This is the best manchester airport has been for a long time, we flew in from fuetaventura passport control was brilliant and cases came more or less straight away. Just hope you can keep it up",5
"I hope I never have to fly from here again.

- When we disembarked the plane, we were told to wait on the tarmac for the bus to take us to the terminal, by one member of staff, a minute later, we were told by another member of staff that we weren't allowed to be on the tarmac and needed to go back and stand on the steps.

- While waiting for the bus, the same members of staff were messing about, with one jumping out of a cart and chasing around.

- There was only 1 bus put on for a full plane

- We had to wait over 30 minutes for the bags to be unloaded from the plane and put on the conveyabelt.

- One member of staff, had to transport 2 passengers in wheel chairs from the plane to the terminal, at the same time.

- Ladies wheelchair was broken and no one around to speak to.

- No staff around to help or support passengers

2 stars is being generous.",2
"Absolutely poor direction system in the airport ,
Absolutely horrible security check.
They take away all they can and stuff things into their own private bags as if totally normal.  Will avoid MAN airport in future.",1
"I have to go through this airport a couple of times per year. Its always just kinda ok. There was never a trip or visit when i was pleasantly surprised and usually just leave thinking ""yeah that's Manchester airport...""
Checking in and going through checks can take ages, and it looks like the equipment and scanners are just old and don't really compare to other countries' big airports. Old and in need of replacement is what some (not all) parts of the airport generally feels like, and it all has a very 2000s type of feel to it.
Uber pickups are a PITA as they all have to go through the same parking garage for some reason.
Most of the airport just has a bit of a depressing and dull look to it, so I never really look forward to going.",3
"If I could give zero stars I would, security time was more than 50 minutes,staff are by the most rude I have ever come across anywhere in the world, if u hate ur job that much don't do it then. WiFi drops in and out,just all in all would rather fly to anywhere else instead of going back there",1
"Does security at this airport even know what a liquid is? Do they know what 100ml or 3 oz look like? Your security needs to update their understanding of what is allowed in flight and what isn't, ANYWHERE as long as nothing over 100 ml, it is allowed. I was forced to leave sampler size Lancome CREAMS 😒 because they were ""liquid"" and they were far less than 100ml.

And the agent took my mascara because apparently thats a liquid too! 🤯😒😬😑",1
"On site parking is a rip off and they won't hesitate to gouge you at every opportunity. Parking prices have doubled in the last 3-4 years. Booked early but realised the day before flying I had made a slight mistake on our return flight, putting in the take off time instead of landing. Only 12 hours difference but Manchester Airport insisted on cancelling the entire booking and had to rebook at 50% more, all for a small mistake. I will not be using the airport or it's rip off parking again!",1
Yup it’s still a cattle market. Security was horrible and grouchy. It’s OUR fault that we didn’t get there in time according to the staff even though we were there 2 hours before. Security machines are so outdated. They pulled 3 out of 4 bags to check with only 2 people checking. Finally through security and then our flight is on last call even though we had 20 min before boarding. We were herded into a hallway to wait 20 mi. to begin boarding. Never even made it to the shops. Worst airport ever experienced. Runner up to Denver Airport!,1
"Could be good airport, has all the facilities to be one however it’s been ran shockingly for years. So many issues. Every time I’m landing or taking off from Manchester the pilots are moaning at how unorganised the airport is. It’s renowned for being useless. Needs improving.",1
"Travel through T3 often, when quiet I have noticed two mice that travel together from a crack in a wall at gate 52 to the 3 vending machines on the opposite wall. They hang around behind the vending machines for quiet some time so take a wild guess at what they are doing behind them.

Get it sorted you grubby lot. Got a mind to inform the relevant hygiene folk.",1
"T2 modernised and quite good, queues are now manageable.
T1 can be confusing as they constantly keep changing where you need to go through security l, sometimes every 30 minutes!

T3 is straight forward most of the time as it's mainly just Ryanair, British Airways and Vueling. Check in, turn around and security is in front of you.
Wh Smith has opened up again in T3 and Caffe Nero as well.",4
"Bought a ticket for my friend to come out to New Orleans for my sisters wedding.
Security detained my friend for traces of explosives on their BRAND NEW suitcase. Fully searched, padded down, and then denied entry to the flight. Accused of being a terrorist and questioned and interrogated. Ran magnets over the skin of her entire body to check for explosives. Said that she’s lucky she wasn’t arrested on the spot. THEN they managed to LOSE MY FRIENDS LUGGAGE!!!
Incompetent airport security and staff negligently affecting peoples lives at a whim because they can’t be asked to properly do their job.
Never use this airport. Avoid at ALL costs. You’ll be lucky if all you lose is patience, sanity, and brain cells.",1
"The charges for vehicle pick up and drop off are ridiculously high.
The baggage security check is about as inefficient as it can be. Overmanned too! It is the worst airport I've ever been through.
Think it's Liverpool or LBA next time...
I gave it 1 star because zero isn't an option.",1
"Flew out Monday 8am from terminal 2 straight through security and plenty of seats to wait for my flight, came back Thursday 3pm no queues for passport control using the automated machines, great service that we allow uk and EU passport holders to use the automated machines unlike Germany where you have to queue for border control as they turn off the automated machines for UK travellers. Parked on T2 multi story west 3 minute walk to the terminal and nice and secure for my trip, handy to take a photo of the floor and area that you are parked in for your return",5
"Via geographical misfortune we have to utilise Manchester airport several times a year. Our privilege to be able to travel that much is not lost on me. Every visit is a miserable experience. It starts with the cost of parking or getting dropped off. Trying to encourage use of public transport will only work if sufficient, timely services are actually available. Even the pothole ridden surfaces outside the terminals will attempt to scupper your attempts to pull your suitcase along or unhelpfully impact those with mobility issues.

The terminals are overcrowded, run down and an outright embarrassment especially those who are unfortunate enough to utilise T3. Imagine a bus station in a once bustling industrial town which has been long been under invested in and forgotten about. Arrivals at T1 will have you thinking you got off the plane in the 1970s. If this was the brief for international arrivals the owners nailed it. If not give it a paint at the very least please for the love of our expensive airport taxes.

The staff lack any joy which I can only assume is due to their treatment and not a prerequisite to their employment.
Their main interaction with passengers is to bark one word commands. Every trip I try to get one to smile. This is still a goal I am yet to achieve.

Security is nothing but stressful, chaotic and unsafe. Huge queues, frustrated passengers and staff alike. Your belongings will head off through X-ray and if you’re lucky they will still be there once you finally get through the scanner.

Food offerings vary between terminals but if you fancy unhealthy, overly expensive food alongside a pint at 4am you’re in luck. Pret is probably the only reasonable offering. Terminal 3 just do yourself a favour and take your own food.

If there is any opportunity to fly from Liverpool or even London take it. Future you will thank you.",1
"Went to pick up a family member. What a bloody nightmare, trying to pick up at terminal 3. Manchester Airport you are taking the P--S when it come to customer care. Don't mind paying, however have the decency in giving appropriate parking instructions.",1
A clean and a much quieter airport with good facilities. There terminals hosting a lot of international carriers. The duty free shop here is more cost efficient than most others that I have visited. Its sometimes quite a long walk to certain gates and it would have been nice to offer better facilities for people who cannot make it in a stretch. There are good parking facilities around if you are looking for long stay parking. Wonder what happened to long stay Manchester Airport parking. The fares are also good to Middle East and Asian destinations,4
"Vast improvements since our January trip. Much cleaner, faster service shame flight was 3 hours late due to plane then thunder storm.",5
The developing world has better airports!  Such a shame to see the airport being milked for profit with such poor management.  Probably one of the worst major airports in the world at the present time.,1
One of the most out of touch airports in the world and not upto standard. Charging for trolleys! Do they think every international passenger knows to carry change. And to top it the card machines to pay for the trolleys don’t work. Real Shame !,1
"Manchester Airport Terminal 1 is a modern and spacious facility that offers a comfortable and efficient travel experience. The terminal is well-organized and easy to navigate, with clear signage and helpful staff available to assist passengers. The security process is reported to be quick and efficient, with minimal waiting times.

Once past security, travelers have access to a wide range of shops, restaurants, and cafes. From high-end fashion brands to popular fast food chains, there is something for everyone. The terminal also offers free Wi-Fi, charging points, and comfortable seating areas, making it easy for passengers to relax or get some work done before their flight.

Travelers also praise the cleanliness and upkeep of the terminal, with staff regularly cleaning and maintaining the facilities. The airport's transport links are also reported to be excellent, with easy access to trains, buses, and taxis for onward travel.

Overall, Manchester Airport Terminal 1 offers a pleasant and hassle-free travel experience for both domestic and international passengers. With its modern facilities, efficient processes, and excellent transport links, it's no surprise that this terminal is a popular choice among travelers.",5
Travelator not working. My sister is 82 and it's a very long walk from the train station to the terminal. This is the second time we have flown from Manchester (last year) and it wasn't working then either.,5
"T2 was a little busy,  but everything was smooth, duty free has good discounts on perfume..",5
very quick to come through with customs and baggage good off site  parking at  Toad for 70.00 for one week,5
I don't even wanna rate it as 1 star. The attitude of staff working here was extremely horrible. The experience of security check and identity check were the worst I even seen; being rude to the passengers; keep chitchatting and wasting passenger's time. I must advise my fd to take extra attention if they need to land Manchester Airport without all alternatives. WHY DON'T COUNCIL DEAL WITH IT ?,1
I had to get special assistant. It was booked earlier like required and I was told to arrive 2 to 3 hours earlier than the flight time and I did it. I was stuck in the waiting room for special assistance for 1 hour and 15 minutes. I could not stop to buy anything or go to toilet due the waiting time lost in there.,3
Used once to be good. Now is the pits. T2 ok but 1 and 3 are Third World. Hate the place but have to use it most of time. When can do opt for Liverpool for certain destinations...Manchester Airport sure knows how to charge..be it for parking pick  up or trolley hire..,1
"Check in ( Emirates ) fine.Security ( good & quick) but oh the bars in T1 are dire.We arrived at 7pm ( we are 60 and hadn't had a drink at this point)and it was obvious the downstairs one and the Grain ( and something upstairs )wanted to go home rather than serve us.Managed to get 2 x pints  at £7 each, no smile, no customer skills just miserable acceptance.Decided to try the Grain one upstairs.Staff mopping the floor with disinfectant, mops abandoned on floor ( trip hazard) corralled into an unmapped area like sheep.Went to bar to be told it was service via QR code.Attempted this, it showed system down and asked me to alert server.Back to bar, refused service, told would be "" back up"" in 5 minutes.Tried again, got to payment stage then it went down again.Alerted member of staff and explained we had to be at gate soon and could he or one of the other many members of staff who were doing anything other than serving please serve me.He then accused me of lying ( about Gate time) so we left.
Been through many airport hospitality lounges in the world but Manchester T1 you are the worse...by far!",1
A reasonable airport that is relatively easy to get to. Other than the long wait at security the rest of my journey was easy and fairly efficient.,4
"Typical state of British hospitality and inability to look have a high standard of customer care. T3 departures has no smoking area even for a non smoker I found this laughably only 1 member of staff on prior to 6am meant long questions for everyone, welfare facilities below standard for hygiene with arrival mens toilets at baggage collection looked like the scene from trainspotting....

Upon arriving back in the UK there was no wheelchair available and asked to walk if possible but we could not do this due to my mother suffering with CoPd we waited for over 40 minutes for a wheelchair..

Unlike like the Spanish Airport where they had a wheel chair assistant push my Mother from the main entrance to the aeroplane.",1
Terminal 1 is quickly becoming the UK's worst airport. Recommending people arrive at the airport 3-4 hours in advance to excuse the terrible management and lengthy queues is just insanity. The drop off and pick up charges are astronomical and the experience is chaotic from start to finish. Do yourself a favour and if you can - fly from elsewhere!,1
"Much better going from local airports than large international ones, more stressful finding check in desks, going through security etc",3
Extremely busy in the mornings and on holidays. Service level varies between terminals. Terminal 1 is much better for family travelers comparing to Terminal 3. The airport layout is super confusing for a first time traveler.,5
"It is fine, but it takes ages to taxi. It was 20 minutes from landing to starting to deboard. Otherwise,it was not too bad!",4
"The airport is heavily understaffed and there's barely any staff members around to help in this hectic airport. We had a stressful issue but it was resolved.

When we arrived to collect our bags for our next connecting flight, the baggage from qutar airways took 2/3 hours to finally come out. By the time we collected our bags the plane already departed. We had to walk for 15 mins to the other terminal, they mentioned we could either pay for our own hotel and take the flight tomorrow or get on a minibus to our next airport for free. We had to walk 15 mins back to the terminal 2 and the bus already left. Talked to some other staff members and we waited half an hour, they set us up a taxi to our airport.",1
"Badly in need to a refurb to accommodate the number of travellers it handles. Long ques at security are a common issue. The shops restaurants and bars you would normally expect are all there. The airport is very well connected to the city with tram, train and bus links.",3
"Usually use Terminal 1 which is fine. Recently used Terminal 2. You have to walk miles to get there, and couldn't get a hot drink even though it was early evening. Toilets not great.",3
"20th December 21. Flying to Malaga, T2 A11. Flew, literally through check-in and security. Took about 30 mins. Then the dreaded long walk to the gate...

Only one of the floor escalators was working. Hmmm.

Gate was deserted when we arrived. Still lot's of people not wearing masks. Can they all be except.

Anyway, not as stressful as anticipated. Will update later...",4
"The most inefficient airport I've ever been. The control takes ages, they even check the labels of your perfume and makeup. I've never seen anything like this. Avoid this airport if you can and always consider 30min waiting time, or more if you're traveling with other people.",1
Got back from Goa late. Had to exit the plane by steps in rain then what seemed a half mile walk up a manky corridor to a fully automated passport control. Pi led up cases then went to find pickup point. No signs whatsoever. Not impressed,3
"Terminal 2: to get here you need to walk through a long alley. The departure hall is great and it’s easy to navigate yourself around this place. There is a free 4 hour wifi. Toilets are located right near the entrance, and they are clean. There is a tool to measure your luggage here for £1.",5
I was dropping a passenger off with a child and I had to go inside terminal to help them with there luggage as the passenger was was disable but when I returned to my car the security personnel had shouted at me for leaving my car and on of top thatthey charged me £25 for 13 minutes. Its basically a scam and a quick way to make money from public.,1
Took a lot of time for immigration. Less number of counters. Infrastructure not so good when a there is a big event in the city.,3
"Tbh,I'm a bit worried about whole Airport atmosphere that is happening there. Some of the bits like automatic floors between terminals not working at all,no one cares and that's a bit sad thing seeing old people (especially ladies) walking with luggage without support. Toilets in very bad conditions,leakages everywhere and just yellow signs putted on the floor showing lack of interest in customers good feeling, some of the customer care related people working in stressfull enviroment,very dark lightning that works very bad towards how the airport workers feel and act towards customers etc. Big airport but unfortunatelly not really clean,my believe is that people that works at caffe's inside the airport are getting paid not enough to be motivated to clean thier areas... i might be wrong and i hope i am wrong,but this is what i have seen when i was departing before Christmass and when i was arriving after. To management and whole group of owners and partners responsible for the airport,time to step up and make some changes. I believe in positive changes that will happen in upcoming 2024. All the best to everyone. Regards",3
"Parked away from the airport, in small carpark by Shadomoss tram stop, and I'm glad I did, the car park wasn't busy, it cost £2 an hour, gone to the airport on the tram that cost £1.90 return. No stress. There is only one thing getting from the station at the airport to terminal 3 wasn't well sign posted. But I got there.",5
"Could be easier to get around.
BEWARE MEET & GREET T2 Parking; do not leave things in the car - I had a hi vi bomber jacket go walkies.",1
"Terminal 1 is one of the most insane airports I've travelled in. Its like peak time travel on the trains in India and the security took nearly 20 minutes to get to being seen.. then I watched 1 member of staff put the same bag though 3 times and no one came and helped move the backlog. It was bad. Still I was told by staff this was a quiet day..
I'll not be back.",2
"I travel every month internationally and this is potentially the worst airport I have been through. Clearly there are no lessons learnt from major airports.

It has taken us almost 2 hours from bag drop off to getting to the gate.!

None of the travelators were working from T2 to T1.

I will do everything to avoid flying through this airport in the future",1
"Getting through security is super painful and slow.. bags went round and round.. not enough people checking... so much time wasted.. thankfully there wasnt much queues.

People are nice...",2
"Airport security is a humbling experience at the best of times. Terminal 1 at Manchester today attained humiliating status 👏. After queueing for 30 mins finally our bags go through. My bag pops out, yay, my coat in the other tray disappears the wrong side of the screen for further exploration 😑 . It wasn't the only tray diverted, in fact my tray didn't make it's way very far at all. I should estimate there was 7 or 8 trays ahead of mine on the belt. However, this was only the preliminary queue. Next stage the tray is placed onto a trolley into a queue of trolleys which inch forward every five minutes, the gaggle of desperate wannabe flyers arching their neck to see their belongings jostle for position as they nervously check their gate closing time. After 31 mins of waiting I finally get called forward, confident there was no reason for my bag to be siphoned into the retards queue. The security personnel loads up the screen and informs me 'the machine couldn't get a photo' and casually tells me it needs to go through the scanner again!

We were fortunate that we were very early for our flight. Lots of people will have missed their flight today and others had a needlessly stressful experience. If you have to go through T1 at Manchester please get there very early and please don't be one of those tards that leave a liquid in your case.",1
"Despite spending millions on a new terminal 2 the airport is just as useless as ever. Large queues at the border with only half the egates in use and we've been waiting an hour and half for our luggage due to 'understaffing', which has been the case for years now.",1
I hopped on my flight which was supposed to be taking me to Paris. I instead ended up in the slums of Russia. I was lost in the middle of nowhere and didn’t know what to do. I tried asking a man for help but he was  attacked by a wild bear. He fought it off with just his bare hands. Dude was a beast. Anyways I ended spending 3 and 1/2 months in Russia with no way out. Next time I will be using a different airport as I hope to have my flight correct. Yours truly Bill ✌️,1
"Rudest security and check-in staff ever. When I was checking-in and going through security I had some questions and, let's say the style in which hey converse could have been better, especially Ryan's at hand luggage screening.

Also, crammed seating space in T3, while there are plenty of luxurious shops no one even goes to (it's a Ryanair terminal, come on)",1
"A great improvement, fast and efficient security check. Staff very friendly and attentive, jet2 staff especially.",5
"Departed from terminal 2, got there 3 hrs before our flight and the time it took us to get through self check in (which is a joke) and security we had 10 minutes to get to our gate (quite a walk from security) before it closed
just enough time to buy a drink out of the vending machine. The staff at self check in tell you to go and put your bags on certain conveyors then tell you to go somewhere else and the staff just sit there talking whilst your stood there waiting. Which means other people behind you in the queue go through quicker than you do.

Then on returning we were waiting 45 minutes for our cases. I haven't used this airport for over 20 years and not sure I will again.",1
Sort it out .. picking up  arriving passengers is a farce . The express pick up for T2 is in the Long Stay car park .. sign posting is terrible .. once  in the car park you are in a single file queue .. with narrow lanes. The car in front of me hit a traffic bollard . Seriously needs sorting out by someone with some common sense ..,1
"To the two women who were so  mean and rude to me at Terminal 3 at one night on midnight — one a tall blonde woman in her 40s, the other a lady in her late 50s with brown hair ( who serious bad breath whilst snapping at me to flip my passport up) - hi, i don’t hate you, i wouldn’t want your lives for the world. It must make you feel good undermining and humiliating someone who has clearly vulnerabilities. All the best.

The rest of the staff were lovely if abrupt with other customers, which I found uncomftable with.",1
Waited over an hour for bags and was supposed to have assistance on arrival. Nobody was there to help me and said they had no idea about it despite having it on my boarding card. Worst airport I have to go through and it's gotten much worse through the years.,1
The newly designed airport is excellent. The self check in kiosk are excellent. Apart from occasional blip the check in is easy. Staff at Qatar counter were excellent.,5
"Absolutely disgusting, treated worse than cattle. Don't waste your money parking if you are taking people to international departures, because there's nowhere to go and have a drink or snack after they've checked in their luggage.
Just go to the drop off area and say your goodbyes there 😢😢
Unfortunately 1 star is the least I'm able to rate!!",1
We flew in and out through Virgin Atlantic.  The airport was easy to navigate.  Nice shops and restaurants to try.,4
"After all the money pumped into this place the amount they thieve off the passenger's you would expect a smoother operation. I'd say the staff need to meet with other international airports to find out how to run an airport. Again with the money that's taken you would expect neat tidy looking terminals , T3 is the pits and embarrassing. The external of the airport is dilapidated. The staff are rude as f,  but that's what you get! Landing back at midnight the queue for passport control is silly, it's delay after delay at this airport. It's a shame I have use this airport. Get the Management from Liverpool airport over here.",1
"It's all changed since the last time I came here dropping off my parents and it used to be free dropping off but a £5 Google pay to lift the barrier got me out and on my way home.
On the way to pick up was straight forward but I had problems with the machine and the payment until my daughter got out as I am disabled, the barrier lifted and we were on our way home.
I can't comment on the interior of the airport but I would say it has everything and more for your needs and plenty of people to assist.",5
What kind of retarded international airport requires £1 coin for a luggage trolley!!! Absolutely ridiculous! And the card function doesn’t work on most of them and when you do find one that accepts card that doesn’t work on first attempt either! Sort yourselves out Manchester airport! Embarrassing!,1
I am giving this because it is really waste of time and money for those passengers and the Manchester Airport security staff to go through all the regular security checks when I saw with my own eyes the passenger on 24A vaping his e-cigarettes on the flight EZY U22151 on 12/04/2024!!!,1
"As expected, arrived, easy check in, had something to eat, a coffee, stroll around the shops and got on our flight. All without stress",5
"Use it regularly and although its not the best airport I've ever been to, I've never had any issues here either. Usually very crowded and not very tidy, but they cleverly handle loads of passengers.",4
Went to pick up from t3. Cost 20 pound waiting just over an hour. Going into the pick  up zone through car park is like the crystal maze. Coming out was chaotic with cars coming from all sides to go through a tiny gap through car park. Probably ok if you know the system/ picked up before but first time user stressfull.,1
"Easily the worst airport in Europe. I have no idea how anyone is leaving more than 1 star review. 2 hours in queue just to get past security and i had to skip the last leg in order not to miss the flight. Rude staff, finally a lady helped at the scanners. Still a huge queue. Ran to the gate, as announcements about the flight departing were coming out. At the gate no one, no plane. Turns out the plane was delayed and had just landed, but going to a different gate. Ran to the literal other side of the terminal, to the new gate. Waited another 2 hours to depart. No slot to depart. Someone forgetting their laptop inside the terminal. Turns out the terminal was renovated, didn't get a chance to see it. None of the escalators worked, but hey. If you made it this far, i wish you the best of luck fellow traveler.",1
"Absolutely dirty. Embarassing airport. Anglo-Saxon + EEA club, means you can stay in the UK for 6 months.

Needs refurbishments.
Basically demolish it to the ground and start again. Vomit just all over the floor left unattended.

Coming back from Istanbul I can't help but think:
Istanbul beats this Manchester all day.
IST Airport beats Manchester Airport all day
Turkiye and its people beat the UK all day.

Not just the airport but the city and country need a revival. Depression everywhere.",1
"Manchester Airport is one of the better if not the best UK airport. Depending on where you want to fly, there are some great connections.

As far as large airports go, Heathrow, Birmingham, Gatwick, Manchester is the best. It’s not at quick to get through as smaller airports, but much quicker than the London airports.

Lots of shops and food make it better than Birmingham.

Easy to get round, even if you are in the wrong terminal you can just walk to the right one.

Lots of taxis and buses. You can take a train direct from the airport to Manchester. So travel to and from the airport is convenient.

They have done a lot to improve the time it takes for bags to arrive, but it’s still slow, so plan your trip for wait for bags.

The staff are friendly. Security a little less so, but people in the shops are great.

The only strange this is the very subdued, even dark lighting they have in the lounge at T1. But the rest of the airport is bright and light.",4
The airport is much smaller and has very basic amenities for the footfall it handles.  Huge queues at the economy class check in and security check is appalling.  For business classs queues are avoided but lounges facilities are very basic with employees acting like police than customer service. I had to face it as emirates lounge access was denied.,3
"Busy, clean, organised,  friendly.
The airport is big and sometimes not very easy to get around.  It is important that you arrive in advance, as you will walk on average about 10 or 15 minutes to arrive at your gate",5
Got back into terminal 3 tonight sailed through passport control with ease the member of staff was very knowledgeable and funny. Totally different story by the time to get luggage back waiting over 30 minutes and staff around there not very helpful at all.,2
"Terminal 1 Security: poor communication, unprofessional staff, not good!

Coming through terminal 1 security this morning, I specifically asked before going through “do I need to take my hair straighteners out of my bag?” and one of the workers said “no straighteners are fine”. I then had a long delay waiting for my bag to be searched; when it was finally searched at the other end I was told by two staff members this was due to the hair straighteners. I explained that I had checked with one of their colleagues who said they were fine, one of the staff members then said “I’m not saying anything” and the other repeated “I’m not saying anything either”, to which I replied “well someone needs to say something”. Absolutely ridiculous, unnecessary delays caused to customers due to poor communication between staff.",2
"Beware - Special Assistance is extremely rude and unempathetic. We were dropping off a vulnerable older relative at the airport who does not know English and wouldn't be able to find her way around otherwise. We have used Special Assistance at other points for this relative without a hitch, but on January 8th 2024 at around 10am, we were met by one of the assistants. We did not get a name but he was a man around his 50s, balding and of an average height and broader build. He asked if we wanted a wheelchair- to reiterate, we have used this service in all the other occassions this relative has travelled without a hitch. We explained that she did not speak or understand English as communication between them would be a barrier, and he replied with ""We are not a translation service"" in a mocking tone. He then proceeded to turn his back to us for the remainder of the interaction and ignore us, despite our lack of confrontation and remaining cordial. When he was with our relative, he walked two meters ahead of her at all times and did not make an effort to use Google Translate, as other colleagues have done, or to carry her bags - she is an older lady with many medical issues that affect her mobility, and anxiety. We did not feel like she was safe with Special Assistance any longer - dropping off a loved one at an airport is a stressful enough experience, and this only added to the sense of unease. This event has severely impacted on our view of customer service and the racism with which Manchester Airport associates treat their customers - quite hypocritical for an airport recieving thousands of people from all identities and nationalities across the world. The assistance our relative required was not adequately provided today, and this will stain our perception and discourage our use of this service and airport for future travel. I truly hope that no other users of this service have to recieve this distinct lack of sympathy and childish behaviour from this grown individual. We raised this issue up with the gentleman at the desk but he was rather unhelpful and seemed at a loss for words himself. An appaling incident for an airport that prides itself on inclusion and internationality.",1
"Can not believe that the walk from the train station to terminal 2 is around 20 minutes. Then security is at the other end of the terminal, and to top things off, you get through security and jet 2 gates are down two levels and right at the fecking end, then you have to get on a friggin bus to get to the plane",1
Great airport plenty of hotels nearby good choice of food outlets and shops loads of parking places,5
"Good airport, but when it's busy  - it's busy. Long queues for check in. Self serve  is much quicker. Usually very busy going through security, which is usually held up with travellers not following the hand luggage restictions. Random searches are common, even if you think you've taken out your liquids.  Plenty of clear bags available. Must allow extra time for security. But once through there's plenty of seating and shops to pass the time away.",3
"Passport control and security were excellent in Nov 23. However, car park was dearer than the flight by about 30 quid and wasbl also dearer than the hotels in Malaga for the weekend. So if budgeting for a cheap weekend away allow for the car park being the dearest element or find an airport that cares about its customers.Rip Off.",2
"Going out was fine with Jet2, very smooth, flight on time. Coming back with Jet2 everything fine, even landed early, however, bags took over an hour to arrive on the carousel. The area of the carousels was filthy dirty, suitcases abandoned everywhere, I've no idea where they came from, must have been lost from previous flights. Toilets filthy, first one out of order, second one disgusting, third had no toilet paper... Mirrors filthy. Airport has feeling of a third world country, one that you'd visit years ago when nobody cared about cleanliness. Could have walked out with any of the abandoned suitcases I felt like as there were no staff around.",2
"AVOID BY ALL MEANS AIRFRANCE,  yesterday I had my flights book to Johannesburg with this airline for a high level government summit, as I needed visa I couldn't do check in online, the website kept giving error and said the only option was to get my visa verified in the airport. I arrived to Manchetser airport 2h30 before the flight  to an awful very slow queue then after 1h on the line I was told the flight was overbooked and possibly they had to get re-routed, they made me go through security (a big mess in Manchester airport waiting 30 mins in the line and to get my bag checked) and then I reached the gate where the boarding was delayed almost 40 mins. At the end 4 people including myself (without British passports) were left out the plain, however at last minute they picked up one person without a clear reason to occupy the last seat at the plain (don't wanna think because he was the only white person) and they said sorry you need to leave the boarding room, this was a third party problem about being overbooked... and all the options for re routing were terrible, their next flight 12 hours later was already full and their next flight 15 hours later had a 12 hours wait in Paris arriving to Johannesburg after my intervention at the summit... after expending more than £200 on visas and transportation to get to the airport the staff said well sorry we will take you to the entrance and you will have to leave, without any further support and explanation. Myself and other people who couldn't board were treated in a very racist and with lack comprehension not other options for traveling from other cities were even provided, I really hope my sponsors can get a full refund back even if I wasn't given with any document or so saying the flight was overbooked. First picture on the boarding gate flight delayed and second picture we non white people and foreign were left out the flight... coincidence or racism???",1
"Always a mediocre service. What are the staff doing here? Every other airport I have been to has efficient and great customer service and I'm talking ones that are much bigger in comparison to Manchester. From your experience throughout boarding to security there is no consistency and staff and not helpful at all. Most recently we have had to wait over an hour an a half for luggage to appear. How is it that airports like turkey which are probably 5 times the size can have our luggage out within 10 to 15minutes.  This airport needs a full revamp and it looks like an old school dinner hall.

**EDIT I forgot to mention the absolute scam in relation to parking charges. 6pound for 5 minutes and 12 pound for anything up to 10 minutes to drop someone off. Prices for short stay and long stay are also a scam. Why is this airport so rubbish.",1
"A absolute kip of a airport a total embarrassment to the once proud country of England. Feels like going back in a time machine to 1984, poorly signed, very few bag drop offs, security takes the best part of a hour, terrible food, dirty toilets and the staff are absolutely clueless. Won't be back would rather get a boat.",1
"The worst airport ever . Flights delayed , 2 buses instead of 3 and road work all the way as well. Don't go here or from here if you really don't have too . Don't even deserve one star.
Need to add something as was waiting for plane to Wroclaw yesterday without any info on screens or even someone by the desk to answer my questions. Finnaly they have update it with only 3 hours delay. Wasn't be too bad if that would be afternoon but I was 1am in Wroclaw.",1
"This refers to T3.
Not as bad as Gatwick, but not far off. Thoroughly decrepit terminal, dark & soulless. Security are way over the top in terms of bag checking, so give yourself at least 30 mins for that particular experience. A great city like Manchester needs a great airport.",3
"This airport is Terrible ,old,.out dated.  Extortionate..
At Schipol Airport they have a up-to-date system.. all liquids over 100ml can be taken on board in my hand luggage...and doesnt even need to be taken out at security.
Think Manchester will not be like this until year dot😏",1
"Smart, organised but car parking expensive. Drop off minimum of £5 for 5 mins, collection minimum £6 for 30 mins. Daughter's flight delayed so £12 for 40 mins 🫤",4
"Quite possibly one of the worst airports I’ve ever had to visit.

Let me start by saying that’s not a reflection of the hard working staff (every staff member was pleasant and helpful) - but of the poor/ inept management and processes, procedures and systems.

The whole experience felt like one big money grab by MAN management team.

£5 to drop someone off? Daylight robbery! Why not make the first 5 mins free so people can actually drop their loved ones at the door without having to pay through the nose.

Security line moved quite quickly, great work by the security staff. Although the “fast track” line didn’t seem that fast.

Queues at every single establishment including the lounges (some lounges had an hour wait - I would imagine their members would be furious given that they’d paid).

If you’re thinking of paying for any lounges then don’t bother - long queues, cold food and broken coffee machines.
The poor staff were ran off their feet.

Suggestion to MEN Execs and Board: visit other airports and get the basics right!! Stop robbing people blind, have better, more streamlined processes and procedures and make it about the customer not the money grab.

Bottom line: if you can fly out/ into ANY other airport then do so - honestly, the drive from Heathrow up north is more pleasant than experience I’ve had at MAN airport.
STEER CLEAR AT ALL COSTS!!!",1
Slight improvement on terminal 3 for checking process and through security which seems more efficient now compared to 6 months ago.,4
"Very nice clean Airport could do with  more staff working at the Airport and I enjoyed the car park could do with seating for humans while waiting for my Taxi. I since then have my brand new glasses from Specsavers Opticians.I prefer Living in my UK than going abroad but if I did go to back Abroad I would love to visit Spain,Italy, Islamabad where my uncles live in Islamabad city and my grandparents. I am from Keighley .",3
"1 star is too much praise.
I was at the airport almost three hours prior to departure and only made it on my flight after a headlong run. The queue through security was disorganised and literally miles long. Covid measures were not enforced, mainly because there was no space for the crowd to do so.This airport poses a very real safety hazard in many ways.
In all my many years of flying from airports from all over the world, I have NEVER experienced anything like this. At security they blamed people not placing their liquids in the plastic bags. Shame on you, Manchester Airport! I shall avoid flying through you in the future.",1
"My house is 6 miles from MAN.  I now drive to LHR for my flights.  That tells you how rude, broken down, expensive, time consuming, arrogant, lazy and incompetent the place is.  Haven't set foot in it since 2017 when I was given the third degree by Border Force for travelling so frequently.",1
T3 was busy but security process was quite quick and smooth. Staff were polite and friendly. Lots of shops to buy food but nothing for a coeliac.  I do get frustrated that there is a selection for people who choose to be vegetarian.  I do not choose to be coeliac and wish I could switch it off when travelling.  My flight left and arrived on time so I can't complain.,3
An average airport with long distances to walk on transit. They can definitely make it smoother and easier for passengers. Still not up to global standards,2
Get fast track passport passes! £5 and you are through. Very fast service for luggage of tonight’s EasyJet Munich flight.,5
This place gets worse every time I pass through. T2 check in OK - Qatar. Eateries OK. Just a very long walk to the gate and no travellaters. Still a lot of building work to do. Don't think its going to be a pleasant experience when its finished. Dubai/ Abu Dhabi/ Doha its never going to be,3
"One of the worst airports I have ever been to.
1. The security check is pure stress. It loud, overcrowded and appears to be super unorganized. You have to take every everything out of your bags, take of any jackets, belts etc. and put it in a separate tray, I ended up with 5 trays. Apparently they use an automatic scanning system, that's super sensitive and this is when the fun starts. Should you have forgotten the tiniest liquid, electronics device or other ""dangerous"" item, the system singles that tray and it has then to be manually checked by a member of staff. There is nearly not enough staff nor space to do this efficiently as the machine seems to single out every other tray. This led to a lot of people waiting to get processed. And this can take time, a lady next to me was waiting for 45 minutes to get her belongings processed. I was lucky and waited only 15 minutes. In my case the x-ray image was missing and in a second go my belongings were cleared and i did not need a manual processing.
2. The distance between the Terminals is super long and all the electric walk ways were switched off.
3. No easily power sockets. As flying is mostly waiting, it would be really great to get some work done but if you don't come with a fully charged Laptop / phone you are probably out of luck. The only available sockets were in the hallways with lots of digital nomads sitting on the floor next to a socket  to satisfy their devices.",1
Clear signs to follow. Friendly and helpful airport staff. Clean rest rooms. Wide variety of shops on all the floors.,5
Got me to where I wanted to go..... just! Have been through this airport several times and seems to be slowly getting worse last time I barely got through security in time for a domestic flight that I had arrived two hours early for and only because I told three members of staff and the last one ended up fast tracking me so that I didn't miss my flight. The rediculous charges for drop off and pick up are also questionable at best there were no signs indicating that there was a charge for the drop off until after I was in the one way system and couldn't go back again.,2
One of the worst airport i habe ever been. The T3 was dirty and caotic. No place to seat and 3 coffee place full with dirty tables. toilets are smells. queues are forever and everything is a caos. i dont know the rest of the terminals but the T3 is one of the worst in europe.,1
"This airport sucks. Looks depressing and super inefficient.

Crowd control/foot traffic is terrible everytime, baggage takes forever and is crowded... There are multiple free belts but then there's so many people waiting at one belt for their bags 🤦‍♂️

They charge £1 to use a trolley which is embarrassing, don't see that at other airports... And on top of that none of the machines even work.

Staff are lazy, just stand about and do nothing.",1
"I often fly into Manchester airport when I visit England for work or visiting family. The location of the airport is very convenient and the public transportation is good with a train station at the airport. The staff are very helpful and friendly, but security screening can be problematic at times. However, overall one of the better large UK airports.",4
"A major disappointment for an international airport. Not enough chairs and bins. No where to sit down especially elderly people and disabled.
There’s no staff for security and nobody knows where different parking space or washroom are.
Toilets are extremely small and how can you bring in your luggage or watch it .
Your not supposed to leave luggage unattended if you’re a single person traveling.
The problem is that it’s not up to international standards.
Trolly are £1 or €2 when all different airport are free.
It’s so dirty inside the toilets and floor.",1
"Arrived back from hot holidays to a cold (outside) Manchester Airport.
There were queues for the e-passport gates, but they moved along quickly.
Baggage took a while to come through, but terminal  1 seemed much busier than usual, even though it was about 11pm.",4
"Beautiful airport.
Don't ever think of exchange foreign currency Into pound in airport money exchange center, they charge alot.
There is no free WiFi so, if you don't have UK simcard, then you may face problem..
You can get train directly from outside the airport but unfortunately Uber car doesn't come at the gate of airport..",4
"Such a chaotic airport and on purpose if you ask me. Very short staffed at the security gates, very few shops open early morning, long queues again at the only opened coffee shop. Highly discourage travelers to use this airport for a very early flights.",3
"Very slow security on departure with an admin error sending us back to check in desk. Extremely poor and slow baggage service. Airport is under funded, no staff and needs major investment in technology and resources.",1
"Terrible as usual. On arrival, rude staff (not to me but to others this time) at passport control.  Waited a totally unnecessary amount of time for luggage. People had to queue to leave for no reason what-so-ever. Pathetic. Avoid if possible. So much faster at Liverpool Airport.",1
Secure parking was a bit confusing at first but got there in the end. Went straight through to security checking. Very thorough checks made. (Thanks ISIS) waiting by the gates to board. No issues at all.,5
The management must be changed. There are no staffs to attend for wheelchair and sometimes three wheelchairs are pushed by one person. All the third world countries are better than Manchester Airport. The trollies they are worse we have to put a pound for a trolley but we can’t get the money back! Manchester Airport is worse than any country I have traveled! I chose to drive to Heathrow because they are better than Manchester so when are they going to change? Never I suppose. They cannot run an international airport for the people and the fares for a flight is too expensive than a flight from elsewhere Disgustedly disappointed,1
"Just dropped my daughter off at Manchester airport - What an ABSOLUTE diabolical experience .

Confusing car park directions in and out  - the multi-storey prices costing far too much (we paid £20 by the time my daughter got through check in)

BA check in staff and area - you should be ashamed. One particular member of staff (lady) was very vocal and slightly abrupt at those that were in the wrong line - even though it wasn’t made very clear which line those who had  checked  in online should be in.  As all the desk under the bag drop sign were not manned.  We queued for over 45 mins, to all be shouted at from a member of staff for all those that had checked in online to go to the Club world line. Then to follow we further  queued for a further 30 mins.  Whilst the original queue were checking in and those who arrived after us all checked in before us.

What a messy, unprofessional  process - quite a few in the line were starting to panic - so I shouted over to a member of staff that our queue just wasn’t moving (due to only having 1 staff member on the desk)

Eventually, my daughter and others had to be fastracked through security and just made it to the gate.

I can now see why people complain so much about Manchester - sort your/our local airport out …. It’s embarrassing.",1
"A very genuinely, super fast service is provided at Manchester Airport. Plenty of parking spaces at reasonable prices, quick and easy check in procedures if you don’t get held up and lots of shops and restaurants for when you’re waiting to board your plane. One thing I found was that there tends to be a lack of staff to ask question so coming prepared with as much information is essential before you arrive.",4
Went to Manchester airport looking for some chippy and all we could find was dead fish tasted lovely though anyways we got on a flight to go to Canada and Susan broke the window with George's head to let some air in the George fell out the window cuz he thought he saw a chippy and a bird hit him in the head and he had a hole in his head then we found him in he middle of the Atlantic Ocean so yeah it was a nice flight,1
"Organised chaos compared  to smooth running  Liverpool  Airport  and the Aspire  lounge had a measly  selection of items ,,tables unclean,,no forks.
Poor experience  all round.
Also sat on runway  for an extra  1.5 hours before  take off.
Awful place",1
"Needed wheelchair assistance as Manchester has some distances to walk from entrance to plane  . The service was great, they could not do enough to help and stayed with me till my taxi arrived. The plane services was as usual and straightforward.",5
"We flew from terminal 3. Was told to be there 3 hrs before flight, but wasnt told that once you've entered the terminal, you wasn't allowed outside anywhere.
As a smoker, this was extremely frustrating",3
"Arrived here at the airport and noticed that the overall state of it was slightly more acceptable than that of Heathrow's airport. Emirates staff were friendly, so I have no issues with the airline and checking in. The problem came when it was time for the security check and they kept me there from more than half an hour and the security lady personnel kept questioning on why I'm bringing about a handbag. Can't a man buy his girlfriend a gift sometimes? She was very unhelpful and made me feel as if I was a lesser sub class. And after the security checks were done, my once carefully package items were now all strewn  across the trays. That took a while to fix and I was glad to have that ordeal over. The interior of the airport was passable at best. Should take a lesson from Tokyo or Singapore airports",2
"Absolute shambles from start to finish, security and all ground staff should be ashamed of themselves. An embarrassment to the city of Manchester
The most incompetent security. My bag was rejected by security and put on a trolley behind the screen for 30 minutes, I was certain there was nothing that was not allowed, without a word, the bag was put back on the belt and was now ok. 30 minutes wasted with no expectations.
Update. January 2024. Security is still the worst I've ever experienced.",1
Worst airport experience ever! The security is extremely picky with the liquids!! I’ve never seen anything like that before.. I’ve been travelling with the same liquid bag all over and never had issues. Here I needed to dispose half of my liquids!! Unbelievable 🤯 girls be careful while travelling with expensive cosmetics because you might lose them. 🤬,1
I loved it. T2 Had LED light and nice lounge. T1  Very good and a very good Airport 5  Stars.,5
The only airport that creates delays by opening almost all carry on bags for no reason.,1
"Manchester airport-hang your heads in shame! I have watched the utter decline of this place over  the last 30-40 years, from one of the world’s favourite airports in the 90’s to a profit driven/terrible service/quality place that it is today. When I say profit driven, the place is so badly run that they can’t even  maximise profits with a total monopoly! Customers desperate to spend their cash, instead wait in endless lines, queuing up for very poor quality. Not surprised to see how Manchester Airport now performs in the ‘league tables’!",1
"Airport great, some staff may need a reminder on why customer service is important! Jo Malone staff in T2 were amazing, perhaps they could train others?",3
"Flew from terminal 3 much better setup, terminal 1 and 2 are an embrassment for Manchester. Why is customs security so slow compared with other countries",3
"Went to information at Terminal 1 today 13/1/2024, @1,45pm to inquire about my parking, The lady on Duty were very pleasant and helpful, she sorted out my query, I would like thank that lady personally as she were absolutely wonderful,",5
Phone reception suddenly vanished inside T2 arrivals which made it difficult to communicate with the person I was collecting (reception fine immediately outside the building a few metres away). There was a long wait for wheelchair assistance for my family member which made her feel very stressed. Parking is punitively expensive. Some areas are modern and pleasant but some areas could definitely do with some investment.,3
"10.40 Flight, few crowds in airport, managed to do some shopping. All stress free today",5
Very busy lotsa walking standing in queues doing your own bags and labels if I wanted a job in a airport  would of got one,3
"Absolutely appalling, had queue for 90 mins to check in with TUI, only half the check-in desks manned when 250 people trying to check-in. Then having to queue for 40 mins to get into places that serve breakfast once through security. It’s like a third world country airport.",1
"The Airport is too small for the hight passenger numbers. The Buildings are very old and not up to date. Everything is very narrow and cramped.
Security checks are inefficient and chaotic. Plan at least 30-45min for check only. If your luggage has to be double checked plan an extra of 15min.",1
"Manchester airport is supposed to be a world class airport but frankly it is the worst airport I have ever been to in my life - and I’ve traveled across every continent! The airport security is particularly shocking using outdated scanning and slow staff service, people missing flights left right and center. Come on Manchester get it together! For travellers - until Manchester airport finally updates their entire airport (which would require a complete tear down and starting afresh like it’s the 21st century) - travel from Liverpool, much better!",1
"Overall very good
Long walk to gates not a problem
But what is happening in T2 pick up car park a nightmare
Something needs looking into there
Would not give the carpark 1 star",4
Was ok an hours delay  due to technical problems plane change very little information but reached my destination in the end.,4
My jacket was literally robbed in Terminal 3 as I was waiting for the gate to appear on the monitors. Went to security to review CCTV to hopefully catch who took it before my flight (it was last flight of the day and no flights since the jacket was taken so whoever took it was still there until the next flight which was at half 11). They just looked at me and told me the team that checks CCTV is off since 18:00 and they’ll check tommorow morning like what? This happened at 21:00 my flight was at half 23 so the person who robbed my jacket is happily free because an airport of this size cannot employ 1 person to take care of CCTV after 6pm. It’s seriously worrying how if anything happens in the terminal after 18:00 nobody is there to have a look at the cameras. We had over 2 hrs to find out who the thief was and take the jacket back off him if there was anybody to inspect the CCTV and who knows what else he took from other passengers. In the meantime I submitted a form to review the CCTV and hopefully find a solution but seriously dissapointed. If I manage to get my jacket back or a refund I will edit this 1 star to a 5 but security should be a priority in airport. You can’t have no access to CCTV after 6pm it’s dissapointing and a safety risk.,1
Easy transit through check in and passport control. Lots if choice for shopping and food. Clean and warm. A pleasant way to start the holiday.,4
"Fantastic air port, put people's safety before few wingey impatient people.
MAG staff were friendly and helpful even with the muppets that can't put liquids in clear bags.
Sounds like I work there! I can assure you I don't, they are organised and they were great with me. I flew jet 2, again, organised and helpfull.
Best experience I have had out of the 10 times I have used MAG in the last few years.",5
Our whole flight Waited 2 hours  before luggage arrived on the belt😡  & the vehicle pick up point was like the wild west. Manchester Airport was fabulous once upon a time....I will be heading else where to catch any future flights.,1
Danielle hughe that works for ryanair is the worst employer. So rude and she doesn’t even do her job properly!,1
"Always neat but busy especially the searches team ,the buzz and feelings of going away starts here for me .
Loved it and hopefully will be passing the airport again for many more trips .

Update:
Took the airport during the pandemic period again,the security is higher and covid measures concerning  getting the fit to fly PCR certificate as a requirement is essential.
Face mask is highly mandatory within the airport.
Lovely staffs I must say .",4
"Travelled via this airport hassle free,just a little delay on the path of the airlines. But the toilet in this airport was not clean 🧼",4
"Strangest airport terminal I have visited so far. Quite a maze to figure out. The lady at the information desk on 11 November 2023 at about 10:30 am was quite rude and inconsiderate. She is either an anti social element or is herself dealing with some trauma because her wild gesturing and manners were definitely not normal.
She also assumes everyone has 6/6 vision and a blueprint of the airport and she can’t be bothered by any questions.
She works at a help desk for god’s sake! Somebody did not tell her the job description.
Manchester T3 authorities, I urge you to take action against staff that harass vulnerable people and inflict mental trauma. Worst experience. Basic respect is a human right. Please hire the right staff.",1
"By a good margin, this is the worst airport we have ever flown in and out of.

T3 is an absolute joke, rude and unhelpful staff, terminal is filthy with mice running through the coffee shops and lounge areas.

Would give this a lower score if possible.

Avoid if possible!",1
"Nice airpotr, plenty of restaurants and shops",5
"Arrived at T3 this afternoon leaving a clean, efficient airport in Barcelona to the shambles at Manchester Airport. After landing we waited 30 minutes to disembark because the air bridge was broken, some old fashioned steps arrived and after 20 people got off they shut the door because those steps were also bust!
Our luggage had jammed the conveyor because we couldn’t get off the plane and was chucked in a pile with no staff in sight.",1
"Staff are great but there aren't enough of them. Particularly wheelchair wranglers. Three people on our flight needing assistance and and only one person available to provide it. This is NOT an isolated incident. Manchester airport DO YOUR LEGAL DUTY and if that means paying people to sit around occasionally on the offchance that they'll be needed, then so be it. Disabled people are people, not a burden for you to ignore.",2
"£12 to Park for 35 minutes. This Airport knows how to rip people off. My Son's flight arrived later than the scheduled  flight tracker said so ended up going over the 30 minutes which you already pay £6 for, absolute rip off.",1
"Sorry to say this but What shambles Manchester airport is... Going through security was a night mare, total confusion and the layout is abismal, whoever designed it needs sacking and it needs a total revamp. Also went to get food but wished we hadn't bothered, grey fishfinger sandwiches",2
"The airport is fine. The car park and getting out is a joke. It took my taxi half an hour to get out.. someone must have known, since they had kept the barriers up, no change!!!",3
"Clean and fairly modern with reasonably priced shops.
Beware though that due to staff shortages, there can be delays in checking in and boarding the flights. Security was pretty quick though.",3
Flew out of Manchester on Saturday 25th June at 10.00am heading for Jamaica arrived 4 hours before as we were expecting a nightmare after all the things on social media/news we were amazed no queues at the check in desk and sailed through passport control. I am only commenting as people are quick to complain but not say when things go smoothly.,5
"Ah, Manchester Airport, where the only thing taking off faster than planes is your hard-earned cash! Forget boarding passes, the real ticket to this amusement park is the fee for merely glancing at your loved ones. Dropping off or picking up someone is like entering a financial funhouse.

The ticket to the Drop-off Zone is practically a golden visa to a wallet-draining wonderland. You pay for the privilege of a fleeting embrace, and if you dare extend it, prepare for your bank account to nosedive faster than a budget airline in a thunderstorm. It's the kind of place where even the pigeons look at you judgmentally, thinking, ""You paid HOW much for a quick hug?""

And let's not forget the Pick-up Perils! Want to greet your weary traveler at the arrivals gate? Well, that'll cost you your firstborn and possibly a kidney. Manchester Airport has turned the simple act of reuniting with loved ones into a high-stakes financial transaction. It's like they have a sign that says, ""Happiness Tax: Pay here.""

But fear not, they've got a solution for every problem – for a fee, of course. If you want to avoid the charges, perhaps they'll introduce a subscription service: ""Manchester Airport Platinum Hug Pass – Unlimited embraces for the low price of your life savings!""

In summary, Manchester Airport is not just a transportation hub; it's a masterclass in turning love and joy into a profit margin. Consider it a theme park where the rollercoaster of emotion is rivaled only by the loop-de-loops of fees. Buckle up, both emotionally and financially, for the ride of your life!",1
Utter shambles of an airport.  Waited in Terminal 3 luggage carousel for over 2 hours for luggage without any updates from any staff.  Late in the evening so no staff to be seen anywhere other than one person who said they were going to get an update and come back in 10 mins and then never came back at all.  Seen animals in a zoo treated better than how we were treated.  Disgrace of an airport.,1
"Officially opened on 25 June 1938,[6] it was initially known as Ringway Airport, a name still in local use. In World War II, as RAF Ringway, it was a base for the Royal Air Force. The airport is owned and managed by the Manchester Airport Holdings (trading as MAG), a holding company owned by the Australian finance house IFM Investors and the ten metropolitan borough councils of Greater Manchester, with Manchester City Council owning the largest stake. Ringway, after which the airport was named, is a village with a few buildings and a church at the western edge of the airport.",5
"Avoid using this airport if possible. The lounge is not clean, we have to wait long long time at the security check as they put our luggages into the machine over and over again, and there are several gates which are not easily accessible.",2
"AVOID this place if you can . Why you ask? Well it's like a maze to find the required collection point then £6 for 30 minutes  and rises sharply thereafter.  Yet used to be a nice easy airport to navigate round .

Nothing changes still a shambles to drive round and still steal £6 up to 30 minutes to collect loved ones what a joke",1
"The worst airport I have ever travelled through. We arrived three hours before our flight in Terminal 1 and had it not been delayed we would have missed it due to ridiculous rules, wait times and staff with no sense of urgency at all",1
"Another airport that punishes you for using a ride app and not taking the local cabs, sending you to a dirty old parking ground ten minutes by foot from the terminal. Shame on you Manchester Airport.",2
"Manchester Airport terminal 1 is amazing the staff are stunning so helpful adam in assistance area by the check in is so so helpful,  first time flyers my wife suffers from M.E he was amazing thank you all ,",5
"Completely disorganised in relation to soft bag check in,queuing system was changed twice and the waiting time was 40 minutes.This is after queuing at checked in on line where there was a queuing time of 35 minutes.Fast track security was totally unacceptable,again the queuing system was not controlled from point of entry.the member of staff was extremely rude,offensive and unhelpful.many people were complaining.fast track lasted 45 minutes,very poor management.
As a result I just made it to the gate on the final call.
Operations manager should be ashamed,absolute shambles.
Sunday,10.12.23.EK22",1
"Airport works well. Lounges good, and the staff at the airport are friendly. Baggage inspection is the only downside of using MAN, but other than that it is 1st class",5
"After departing from T1 with easyJet, I never wanted to come back! I recently departed from T2 with Air France and had a great travelling experience.

⭐️ Modern Check-in and Security!
⭐️ Friendly Staff helping and assisting people.
⭐️ Amazing departures lounge with good selection of shops.
⭐️ Clean toilet facilities
⭐️ Modern Gate Areas (Gate A1 used)
⭐️ Fast immigration and baggage reclaim.

🤣 Terminal One should meet the standard of Terminal Two!",5
"Horrendous experience!

We arrived at T1 2 hours 15 minutes before our 8:25 flight to Belfast this morning.
The single queue for the check in desks was for all Aer Lingus flights, which was an hour wait to just check luggage in. There were only 2 members of staff, which caused severe delays in checking people in.
We went through to security and it was another 45 minutes of waiting. So many bags were searched and the staff were so unhelpful about the delays, stating “everyone has a flight to catch, you have time” to anyone who was expressing their concerns.

Eventually got through to the departure lounge and our flight status showed as “Go to gate - 5”, then 10 minutes later it changed to “relax”, there was no tannoy announcement about why this was so we made our way to gate 5.

The staff member at the gate told us that due to adverse weather conditions our aircraft was circling overhead and then had to be diverted to Leeds Bradford as it could not land in Manchester. He also happened to mention that there was a lack of staff on hand to assist with plowing and de-icing the runways.

At 8:15 our flight showed on the board as cancelled. Again, no tannoy announcement, no communication from staff - nothing! The flight was then completely removed from the board with no notice to passengers! Other flights were boarded and had been sitting on the runway for hours at this point, with none of them able to take off.

The only staff member at our gate was a member of the Menzies team who later told us that they don’t have any facilities to inform people over tannoy like other airports.

The runways have since been closed and a lot of flights have been cancelled. All because of the lack of initiative at the airport.

Manchester Airport seriously needs to sort itself out, there have been weather forecasts for a couple of weeks preparing us for snow (not that there was very much at all?!) and sub temperatures, so why they acted like they only just found out was ridiculous. Their lack of preparation has disappointed many passengers who have tried to board several flights over the last few days and are yet to get to their final destination to see loved ones and start their festive celebrations.

Extremely disappointing service!",1
Terminal is clean. My criticism would be that the food outlets aren’t table service so If you are by yourself you have to take everything up to the bar loosing your table.,3
Terminal 2 is the best couldn’t be any better I love Manchester airport the food is the best but check in and security are really annoying it tacks so long but overall Manchester airport is the best airport I’ve ever been to,5
"Picked up my daughter from the airport..... Cost me £12 absolute rip off. T2 pick up parking not convenient for drivers or arriving passengers
How can they justify £12 for a 35 minute stay.",1
"Well connected airport, easy to catch a bus from the parking lot to the main building. Many different and interesting shops. Only let down is there's a £5 charge on every currency exchange.",4
The worst airport I’ve ever been to. All restaurants were closed on Sunday at 4.30pm which is ridiculous. Car parking/drop off/pick up situation is a mess and impossible to navigate including the newly built terminal. No signal in the airport and wifi is terrible. Just badly organised and managed place.,1
"Super efficient through passport and security, from alighting the bus at the station it took 25 minutes to do the long terminal 2 walk until I was cleared through said security! Fantastic Manchester.",5
"UPDATE 23/8/22 The airport itself has very much redeemed itself. Still issues with baggage handler delays (not the airports fault this time) flew through terminal 2 check in and security in less than 30 minutes. Much happier experience.

Below review is original review for 5/4/22 only!

Just an awful experience prior to our outbound flight. 80 minutes just to check in our bags and over 2 additional hours to pass through security. We would have missed our flight but for a knock on effect from previous flights meaning the baggage handlers didn't load the bags onto our plane until 20 minutes after the original scheduled take off time. It is far from the worst thing in the world to be delayed at an airport but the MAG management team have got their setup badly wrong. However, the airport staff we encountered were both friendly and professional and worked extremely hard to make the very best of a bad situation. I have lots of sympathy for the airport staff as they are being let down by bad decisions from their employer. Kudos to the staff for remaining so positive in such stressful situations.",4
Very confusing new layout. Being a new user to the revamped terminal 2 I asked where I should go. I was told to join a very large queue. After around 30 mins I found out that I was in the wrong one. Luckily another member of staff got me in the right one and then put me thru express. Need to get the kiosks up and running.,2
"Fly on a regular basis, and generally pretty good, however I don't understand why certain security staff have to be so rude. I understand they need to give clear instructions and be firm, but you don't need to be abrupt and rude, manners cost nothing.",2
Loads of parking spaces can pay both cash and card to the exit the parking is ticketless. Terminal 2 was really amazing and spacious. Hopefully they can put more shops to eat specially for those who was there earlier and travelled from afar. Soothing music must be nice and relaxing,4
"Must be the worst airport in the country. Usually a stressful, expensive and grubby experience. And who expects foreign nationals arriving in this country to have a pound coin handy for a luggage trolley.",1
"Just OK. It is very obvious, that this Airport is aged and a lot of refurb is needed. It is far away from being runned down, but the Authorities needs to take some action. Yes, there are constructions ongoing on and at the Manchester Airport, but it is ongoing since few years. Staff is overall friendly and helpful.",3
"Check in and security were surprisingly fast for once but considering how hot the weather currently is, there was no air-conditioning in T2 which meant it was unbearably hot and uncomfortable. Thankfully I'd booked the escape lounge which took us away from the crowds and they had air-conditioning which meant that the extra hour and half we were delayed was comfortable. We went from gate B3 which was horribly crowded down in the bowels of the airport and from there we transferred by a stiflingly hot bus to the plane in the middle of the tarmac. It's no wonder Manchester airport has been voted the worst airport. If it wasn't for my experience in the lounge my rating would be much lower.",3
"Absolutely disgusting behaviour and service by security point, no common sense regarding baby food and milk. When escalated they won't give me supervisors name to complain. Piss poor all round, keep your expectations below minimum is all ill say.",1
"Another airport that has a fetish for incredibly long corridors and travelators that are never switched on. It’s congested so planes are often waiting to land and depart. Those factors combined you will miss your connecting train and the next one into Manchester will be inexplicably 30 minutes away. They complain about cancelling HS2, get your own house in order first.",1
"The terminals are spread out with gates on multi levels which is ok. However this leads to a lot of walking between terminals if you have transfers. The lack of lift, escalators and mechanical walkways could be a hindrance to those passengers with knee or hip issues.",3
"Delay in getting off plane due to shuttle service delays and then dropped at the wrong terminal. Really hard to find safe pedestrian route to pick up point and very expensive parking for pick up parking.
Automated passport ID never works!",1
"Great place to watch the planes land and take off from Manchester, this was on the other side of the runway across from the public house. Access from near the tunnels just off the slip road.

great to relax and have a good day especially when the weather is good.",5
"Entrance via train station is dirty but airport itself is comfortable and beautifully renovated recently. After spending > 1 Billion pounds, they still can't arrange flight Gates in time. You have to wait for a long time before the gate is known, and then you are supposed to run as 'Final Call' is already announced immediately after displaying the departure gate! Luckily the new software at the security has helped to reduce unnecessary checks. It used to take forever in the past, at the cost of missing ones flight!",2
Clean and spacious. Helpful staff and plenty of stores and shops to choose from for food and drink (if not pricey). Certainly better than Speake/Liverpool John Lennon Airport and probably the best in the north of England.,5
"Most prominent airport in the north west region. Busy, but still great service and customer service from the officials working on the ground and reception, as well as check out points.

Security and other staff are always helpful.

Great for duty-free shopping, good brew of coffee and snacks.

The new terminal area is very spacious with better check in facilities and less queues.

Thank you",5
"Terminal 1 - By far one of the worst airports I have ever traveled from.
Absolutely ridiculous delays resulted in me missing my flight last week even though I have arrived to the airport over 2 hrs early with extremely rude, unhelpful staff.
Today I am trapped in the aircraft on my way back due to the bus driver shortages at 00:50am!! They are just keeping us inside of the aircraft until their figure something out.
There’s no one to take us to the main building and zero indication as to when there will be.
It could be a way of making money for MAC as my boyfriend just had to spent over £20.00 parking fee waiting to pick me up.
Needless to say that the whole airport overall is badly managed , very complicated and unbelievably expensive !

£6 to even drop someone off or pick up..

Absolute disgrace

Terminal 3 - completely different experience- less busy, more modern and user friendly",1
It would help if the travellators worked between the station and T2. It's a long walk with cases. Posted in November 2023. Now almost February 2024 and STILL  no travellators working. Domestic arrivals to station still includes stairs AND  a 12 minute walk. Used Manchester as a starting point for long haul via LHR. Never again.,1
Very busy place with selection of shops and places to eat.,4
"Things were fine on first arriving, dealing with Jet2 staff to check in and bag drop were great. Went downhill from there! Had Fast Track included in booking, it was neither fast nor on track. Security staff standing around doing nothing. Fast Track queue at a standstill. Layout of security conveyor belt area all wrong. Took 35 minutes to get through with Fast Track, hate to think how long it would have been in ""normal queue""!",2
Low class airport. They are charging 2£ to access a defective trolley and no refund. What kind of service is this? Total scam they are forcing passengers to pay for the trolleys and the airport taxis are just over priced. Worst international airport ever. Never recommend,1
"I’ve travelled around the world for business for 25 years. I’ve been to hundreds of airports. I can say with some authority that Manchester Airport is the worst airport in the world. LAX has been demoted to second place. MAN is dingy, dirty, aging, confusing and dark. Fun fact, on this trip only half of one of the lift area could be used because someone had clearly urinated in the corner several hours earlier that day. The HR department seem to have a policy of only employing gruff, rude, ignorant security personnel. The x-ray machines are so out of date that they reject 90% of baggage that is sent through them, meaning that you are stuck in security for at least one hour as the security guards abuse travellers for forgetting to take liquids out of their bags. I passed through Manchester, yesterday I waited for one hour for my bag to be checked, the security person looked at me and sneeringly said “well… the x-ray hasn’t taken the photo properly” in an accusatory manner, zero apology, effectively blaming me for the machine’s mistake, I then had to wait a further 20 minutes for it to be sent back through the machine. I almost missed my flight. Utterly contemptuous attitude to Travellers. I understand that working in security, particularly near the x-ray machines is a life limiting choice. These people have to put up with clearly broken infrastructure, I would amazed if they didn’t get abused on a daily basis by utterly frustrated travellers, topped all this off with the fact that their life expectancy is reduced by the fact they didn’t know how to Google “airport X-ray machine exposure cancer risk” before agreeing to join the world’s most grumpy team. Honestly, I would rather walk to Manchester than use this horrendous place again.",1
The worst airport I've ever been to. Wi-Fi is only free for 4 hours. And it's slow as hell! Staff and locals are helpless and rude. Not enough seats. Overall it's just ridiculous,1
"Worst airport we had been to for a holiday start point. Long queues. It took us 45 minutes to drop our bags off, then over 1 hour to get through security. Only 2 lanes were open.  We told staff our flight gate is closing in 30 minutes, they said there is nothing they can do now but if it gets to the time of our flight and we're not through, then they will move us up to the top of the queue. Ridiculous really. By the time we got through security,  our plane was on final call. A run was needed!!! By the time we got to the gate, they just closed the doors. Luckily they open it up for us, however it took an additional 30 minutes to take off as the remaining 2 people on the plane were also struck at security.

Would highly recommend avoiding",2
"The Security checks on hand luggage at Terminal 1 -absolutely awful!! The staff (a lady in particular) were shouting at everyone before we had even reached the desk. The desk staff were very aggressive and abrupt, throwing small clear bags to us shouting ""your bag is too big"".

I do understand it is very important to make sure we are safe and I appreciate how busy it was but the shouting and abrupt behaviour was uncalled for. My 9 yr old daughter went from being really excited to crying her eyes out....ridiculous behaviour  professional staff.",1
"Quick and easy. Came in T3. Didnt have to walk long from the plane. Borders were very fast. Bags delivery was fast also. Going out from Manchester i must say, borders are very thorough in bagage checks. At 07:00 am at security there was already a 20 wait when your bag was pulled for inspection. For me was fast, i took my time to get liquids out, boots, belt, watch, wallet and water bottle. I really advise to get all things out. I must say the 2 people doing the bag checks at security were very friendly and told people not to forget of all the things they need to take care of.",5
"Lost my kindle at the airport as my bag  and kindle were put through check a second time.
A member of staff told me I had enough time to go back to security check and get it .
I didn't as it was too far to go from departure lounge .I'm 62 with arthritis and believe me thought I was going to be sick as I rushed so much as it was so far .
Needless to say I didn't have enough time they said  I had , and had to turn back to board.
On arrival back into UK and Manchester airport myself and partner went to lost and found. The man didn't seem very knowledgeable and so couldn't help us.
The kindle was brand new and needless to say I'm infuriated with lack of help at the airport.!",3
Not only do they fleece you for drop off but they can't even get the payment machines working properly. Truly run by jokers and chancers,1
"The airport itself is fine but charging people £6 to drop people off for 2mins & then another £ 6 to picking them up for literally 2 mins is daylight robbery, should be ashamed.",3
"Pretty good experience, mobility assistance staff were very helpful. The only issue was that at check-in, because the flight was full, we were asked to check one carry-on bag. My bag had my medical supplies in it, so it was allowed, my daughter in law checked one of her bags (all of our bags were well within the maximum allowed size for carry-on) when we were on the plane other passengers were getting on with huge, oversized bags, one woman was trying to stuff a hockey, equipment sized bag into an overhead storage locker",4
The airport is a spaghetti maze of roads and bad signage. Unless this is a regular occurrence and a daily routine finding your way around the airport can be ferociously scary and misleading. Other airports around the world have far clearer signage to find your way around. Terminal boards with specific airlines names on will help to find the right terminals and make them bigger please.,3
"My experience at Manchester Airport was marred by the dismissive attitude and lack of respect from the staff, highlighting a significant deficiency in customer service.
It’s definitely the worst aeroport ever seen",1
Absolutely shameful and rude staff at passport control. Holding a position of power does not entitle you to be aggressive and rude to children for no reason whatsoever. Avoid this airport if u can! Awful awful.,1
Recently  travelled from manchester with assisted travel on returning to manchester there were 4 people requiring wheelchairs there was 4 wheelchairs but only 2 people to push was asked if my wife would push me which is OK until you collect your cases makes it very difficult.Also number of inverlid toilets locked😒 not very good may be manchester could get training  from foreign airports as they are much better with assisted  travel,2
"Awful airport, clueless staff who all contradict each other. Que to get to the security was 4 hours long and started outside the airport.

Will never be coming back again, everyone should avoid this airport at all costs. Serious health and safety concerns with the ques and people squeezing to get by you. Heat was awful, no water anywhere for 4 hours unless you have your own but who would be going through a security check point with a bottle of water. People where fainting left right and center, an absolute nightmare from start to finish.

This airport needs closed , redesigned and appropriately staffed before it can be opened again. Before something seriously wrong happens.",1
"Worst airport I've been to in my life.
I've been here 5 times and all 5 times the security check is just horrific.. You wait like 1,5 to 2 hours just to get a stupid bag through the check. Even a lighter will put you through a process of another half hour wait for the one staff checking through all bags.
Today they had one (really just one) security check lane open. Some people I know have lost their flight because of this. I nearly lost mine today and was just lucky it was delayed as well.
You should be fined for this!!!",1
"Love this place its my second home :) absolutely one of the best airports in the world, lots of fantastic shops, terminal 3 is a little sparce and prices prices are quite high as u would expect for an airport I suppose, but its very clean and well organised with fantastic views.",5
"Terminal 2 has great facilities, T1 and T3 are no longer fit for purpose and over capacity. Parking pick up and drop off just add insult to injury making you feel uncared for before you even get through the door. The free drop off zone isn’t close to the airport so you can walk a long way or wait for a bus to take you around the houses, so not worth bothering with.",2
i went there july 17 '23 bc andre onana was meant to be there and it got dark and then my phone died but i saw the andre onana so i loved it 10/10 but when my parents found me they were so angry and shouting and they were driving me home then a taxi crashed into out car and they called the police and they didnt come and we drive home and had to get new car and we had to go to the hospital for it like a week ago and they dint care,5
"Used the airport a lot and calculated over 85% of the flights are disrupted due to airport error. Steps not being available, 20 buses but zero drivers to ferry people round, electricity issues etc etc. I am surprised the airlines don’t take more action!?",1
"The worst airport ever. You got long queues everywhere, even infront of the airport their is a long queue to get inside the airport. Lack of staff coordination and dirty toilets are yet another issues. If you want to depart from this airport please do come atleast 4,5 hours early.",1
"Oh dear oh dear. For one of the U.K.’s major airports, arriving into Manchester airport feels like arriving into a something akin to a 1960’s Soviet airport. We deplaned onto a bus, which then drove around the entire airport, before stopping for 15 minutes with no explanation in sight of the doors to the terminal. Dirty toilets, peeling paint, a barely functional baggage carousel, and virtually no staff. Manchester Airport is a disgrace to the great city whose name it bears.",1
"Manchester Airport, while of medium size, is known for its significant passenger traffic, which can sometimes result in longer wait times, particularly at security checkpoints. As you mentioned, the security lane can be quite lengthy, and it's advisable to arrive at the airport with enough time to spare before your flight.

To ensure a stress-free experience, it's a good idea to plan your arrival at the airport well in advance, especially during peak travel times. This will give you ample time to navigate the security process, check in, and proceed to your gate without rushing.

While the airport's size may not be overly intimidating, its popularity and the potential for congestion in security areas make early arrival a wise choice for travelers departing from Manchester Airport.",3
"Lots of construction and diversions as you travel through terminal two. The 1903 lounge operated by virgin was dirty with overflowing toilets.

Security wasn’t bad but the signage afterwards was a joke due to construction.

Not a great experience.",2
"I travel a fair amount on most continents, this has to be the worst organization I have ever experienced. Half of the security checks closed, a queue starting as soon as you enter the airport. Huge posters to remind us to treat their colleagues nicely… or else… but meanwhile the passengers à treated worse than cattle. The gate appears on the screens at the time of boarding and When you go through the boarding pass control, they make you wait in a small steamy staircase for 30 minutes, no information, no human interactions…. This has to be the worst airport experience ever….",1
"A well sign-posted airport, but with one member of staff checking in baggage for a whole airline, in the busiest season of the year, and the self-check-in machines wouldn't scan my boarding pass. By the time I got to the head of the queue it was too late to check in my case and I had to chance it at the gate (thankfully got through no problem but it was unnecessary stress!).",3
"The airport is down the road from my house so I do use it but each time there is an issue. I believe Liverpool is great but can’t be bothered driving there.
Needs improving and staff need to be nicer especially the bag/security area which is always extremely stressful.",3
Just ridiculous.  Waiting forever to get through arrivals.  Understaffed and staff working slow.  While airport is a disgrace and just shows how bad the uk is compared to other countries.,1
"Flew from terminal 2.

Everything modern and clean, variety of shops and food places.

Complaint would be it’s far too busy, we had to queue for everything. Security would’ve been short but had our bags searched which took 30 minutes.

Had to queue for toilets, boots, to get a drink and even to go down an escalator.

On the positives, our bag drop off and flight etc all went smoothly, but a slightly stressful process",4
"Booked assistance-was good on departure but left abandoned at the baggage carousel on arrival back into UK. Waited 20 minutes for another person to help, who was great but being left with no information made the experience very frustrating and worrying as there were no contact numbers available. A shame as going out, once we'd worked where the assistance was, was very good.",2
"This airport is totaly unprepared for that ammount of passangers. Bars are full, no empty seats, people are seating on the floor, I can't imagine waiting here more then 3 hours",1
2 hour delay on flight out. Sat on the tarmac for an extra 1.5 hours due to needing to refuel and baggage. On arrival home having already been over 1 hour late back we arrived to be put on the tarmac in the middle of nowhere then told it’s going to be an hour for the coaches to start arriving to ferry us over to the airport. Simply not good enough,1
"Terminal 2 seems to be really updated and aesthetically pleasing, however the other Terminals look old and in need of a makeover.",4
"The security staff and employees at passport controls treat travellers like cattle - very low manners, customer service quality nil. Very unpleasant",1
"A national embarrassment. Rain leaking through more points in the roof than I could count, generally scruffy throughout and the baggage reclaim hall smells worse than a train toilet. What a welcome home.",1
"Worst customer service experience I have ever had at any airport I've been by far! I appreciate it can be stressful for staff to work in such environment, but there seem to be a culture of 'not willing to help' so embedded.",1
Nice airport with lots of nice shops,5
"Extremely unfriendly to non privileged travelers (other passports). I was given unclear directions at the customs, shouted at, and even though I was the only person in the queue I was left waiting for half an hour with no one calling me forward.",1
"Great wifi, helpful and kind staff! We enjoyed watching aircraft take off and land. I recommend fast track since it is cheap and does a great job saving time. Also pretty cheap for international airports of this size. Great job Manchester Airport!",5
"This airport in short is a chaos, extremely overpriced unwelcoming, packed with rude staff. You get the London treatment and prices for a quality that's outclassed by most European airports.",1
"Attendants at checkin were nice. Attendants throughout security were rude and dismissive- security is different at every airport and people are always going to be unsure and have questions. While I can understand putting up signs telling people to be nice to security, security should be PATIENT and HELPFUL to the patrons.

Restrooms and seating in the shopping/restaurant area are dirty. Areas around the gates were clean.",3
Well it will come as no surprise that Manchester Airport is a complete joke. The security scanner are so badly configured that the 1 hour delay is an underestimate.  My bag was scanned twice over the course of an hour and a half and sill nothing found.,1
"Good functional airport. Staff is really really friendly!! Maybe a star down for the lack of shopping experience or “grandness” plus some of the toilets weren’t clean or well equipped. But I suppose l this could be down to the terminal, lack of staff on the day etc etc. overall, great with lots of flight options",5
"Airport staff at the check in, security and everywhere else were kind  and friendly. The process was smooth enough except for few electronic that were checked for, repeatedly.
TOILETS - the most important thing to look at, if you really consider hygiene as top priority. I have travelled a lot and airports with dirty toilets pisses me off. I found Manchester airport to have really clean and good toilets whenever I have visited. You also have prayer room, children changing rooms, facility for drinking water, etc.
Also, the seats are ample to sit in (or maybe the crowd is less for me always) ;)
You have premium lounges near gate 209 at terminal 2.",4
"Worse than CDG and AMS. Security line for fast track was abysmal. The line was short (maybe a half dozen people) yet the pile of bags for secondary review of bags was the longest I've ever seen, and they let everyone - staff, crew, airport employees, anyone with stollers, wheelchairs etc. jump in line - thereby rendering it not fast at all. Despite an initial line of 6 people, it took about 20 minutes to clear security",1
"This is the worst airport I have ever been to! It is the 80s bus station of international airports. The whole place feels congested, and I have never been through such a poorly organised security checkpoint. The staff seemed short tempered and unfriendly, and the place stunk of airplane exhaust fumes. Not impressed, Manchester!",1
"This is an airport slowly changing for the better. Finally. Huge investment is underway and new management in place which actually cares about passenger experience. Security queues are now much lower and staff friendlier, and I'm sure happier passengers with more time to spare will spend more £ in shops and restaurants! Keep up the good work.",4
NOT AUTISM FRIENDLY. Awful airport. Special assistance staff member was extremely rude towards traveller with hidden disability (autism) that had been disclosed to airline. Was shockingly asked ‘well how are you disabled?!’ and told they had to wear a sunflower lanyard to be identified as disabled (despite it being printed on boarding pass by airline that there was a hidden disability and special assistance allowed). Not everyone wants to wear an eye catching lanyard so everyone can see they are disabled! Demeanour and body language very negative and rude. Interaction caused a panic attack for the autistic traveler. Staff at special assistance clearly have no training or awareness for hidden disabilities. On return flight all passengers on our flight had to wait 1.5hr at baggage claim. Signage is confusing or non-existent. Car parks are absolute chaos. Will never travel from this airport again.,1
"As an airport it does what it says on the tin. You can travel to many parts of the world starting here. It's got lots of ways to get to and from it (bus, rail and cars) but like many big airports near big cities you often get stuck in traffic, not necessarily because of the airport traffic, possibly just because your flight leaves or arrived during the Manchester rush hour.

The airport is easy enough to navigate round with the Skywalk between the terminals. The walk would be quicker if the moving walkways worked, but they were turned off the last two times we went.

If you travel by car be prepared to get lost. There are loads of signs directing you where to go but there are just too many places to quickly spot which of the many roundabout exits you need to take. Drop offs aren't too bad now if you use the park and ride, but if you want to park at the airport be prepared to pay for the privilege. Arrivals parking is £6/30 minutes. With flights arriving early or late and unknown transit times through immigration and baggage collection it's difficult to know exactly when to arrive to pick someone up and you're lucky if you can time it exactly to a 30 minute window. Maybe they should introduce an arrivals park and ride system?",3
"Surprisingly good considering this was the day after industrial action. In passport control, it works so well when the electronic gates are operational: they can shift large numbers quickly. Please use them more.",4
2hrs of queues to check in. 1hr of queues for security. Flight delayed 1.5hrs. And what's more is one of our suitcases never even left the Airport!! The airport itself isn't even that nice. They have the money for a 360 flight simulator but not the 2000 staff redundancies they threw away.,1
"Terminal 1 is the most disorganized airport I have ever had the misfortune to use. It's not a one off experience, it's everytime. The security staff are on a power trip, rude, obnoxious and unhelpful. My bag was put to oneside to be checked. I told them I had 5 mins before my gate closed and the woman went as slow as she possibly could. She asked why I'd left it so late, I said I hadn't I was on time but I had to deal with easyJet and their chaotic procedures, queuing just to get in the airport. They have no name badge or number so know you can't complain, especially when rushing for a flight. If I ever see that woman again she will feel my wrath.",1
Spent 30 minutes in a queue for no reason other than poor organisation. A complete shambles and when customers complained staff argued back. A mess.,1
"Despite arriving well in advance of the recommended time for our flight and purchasing fast track through security, we missed our flight due to it taking close to an hour to get through security. Our bag was pulled aside for additional screening which took over 20 minutes in itself even though there was nothing in the bag at all to cause any concern.
The worst airport experience and service I have ever received. It is clear to see why Manchester airport consistently ranks as the worst airport in the UK.",1
Very nice airport with lot of flights scheduled round the clock,4
"One of the worst airports in the world. Very untidy throughout the airport/security check and toilets.
They even charge 1 pound/baggage trolley. I have never seen any airport charging passengers for baggage trolleys. This sums up how broke this airport and in general the UK is.",1
"Hard to find drop off point, and £5 for 5 min is way too expensive. But airport is nice an clean and helpful staff.",4
Now a pale shadow of its former self. Tragic. A really sad way to end the holiday. It’s like landing at A&E. lots of grumpy people in hi viz jackets barking instructions at you. Place is falling apart and no money to stay competitive. Ah well.,1
"The worst customer service and personnel ever! My mother missed the plane because no one of them was willing to help. They have let her go through check-out and see that the plane has already been closed. No one was even willing to contact the flight service via radio about the last passenger. After all, leaving the airport is some kind of nightmare. Obviously, there are some procedures to obey before they let someone leave the airport after they missed a plane, but the way they treat customers is something ridiculous. ""You can’t leave the airport, and you need to wait for someone to pick you up."" They haven’t informed anyone; no one was even interested in her case. After reaching a random employee and asking him for advice, she left the airport. 2 hours and 30 minutes of waiting for no reason 200£ ticket lost, 30£ parking fees, from which you can’t even use the lift with baby in the pushchair because it is out of service. Signs of all sorts of information about where is what and in what place, not there. Massive maze with a bunch of grumpy staff who don’t care about you. Just another person with another issue. Just help yourself. Seriously, the worst airport from which you can fly DO NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!",1
"I know it's busy but 60 mins to get through security then wait 30 mins queuing up for a drink in the pub that has no draught beer plus only 3 of the 6 stations are manned does test one's patience somewhat.
But generally well organized with helpful staff.",4
Departures boards not very visible at the entrance but the staff was very helpful at all stages. Hundreds of meters to go to pass all the procedures (baggage check underground). The procedures themselves quite well organised.,5
"We came off a flight for a transfer  but  had 4 hours to spare. Bags checked in to destination. All we wanted was a nice coffee (not a machine) and a bite to eat, but the security regulations made us walk all the way out of the arrivals and back round through security and departures to do this. I could see the coffee bar from where I was stood ( literally 3 yards away)  but was told we'd have to walk all the way round due to new rules. It took us 40 mins.
Shocking.",3
The airport is very long from the train station to terminal 3. It's quite a hike. They are training up new staff on the check in desks and security. We got through both quite quickly today. Major work is being carried out to upgrade the airport. Probably to create more sales points!,4
A joke and super unorganized. Rather not be an international airport. They give only ONE little piece of plastic ziplock bag to put your hygiene every day needs stuff in..a joke. Been to numerous of airports and truly this is one of the worst ones. Plus smells like straight piss on the walk way out of this airport. Disgusting.,1
If you flying internationally I would recommend getting there 4 hours before due to queues through security which can be up to 1 hour long. The new terminal is not maintained and is pretty dirty so recommend buying lounge access if you can afford it. All in all this airport is a really awful way to start or finish your trip - so many reasons but can’t be bothered to list them.,1
"Visited 09/01/2022 flew in, quick transfer via coach bus to terminal, didn’t have to wait long for luggage, great experience and smooth journey through terminal to pickup area/car park with ability to pay contactless on exit as well",5
"It's an airport and it's a good one but I've used better. Perhaps it's time for a bigger, improved regional hub for the northwest of England.",4
"Worst airport security ever. Unfortunately, I have to fly out of it a lot. Security is so ridiculous. Literally everything is considered a liquid. They only airport I have to take out my hair iron (why?!) and pretty much everything else. My family of 6 has a running joke about who will get stopped by security every trip because someone always is! No matter if everything is done right. We've had to wait in their awful security line for suitcase checks for machine misreads as well as random checks. I don't know if it's the machines, the personnel, the management or England's strange love of bureaucracy, probably all of the above, but it is the worst out of the many international airports we've flown through. The most pain in the butt, make life difficult for everyone, not even necessary security protocol ever.",1
I really loved the  ease  and ambiance of the airport. In no time I was through with immigration when I got in and when I was leaving too the security check wasn't rowdy,5
"Dreadful! Multiple flight arrivals at 3am with no organisation to filter passengers through the appropriate lane at passport control. 75minutes after landing currently no sign of luggage from our flight.

Communication is non existent.

Manchester has always been poor but this is the best advert for using another airport for holidays.

Holiday organisations should listen and relocate

90minutes and still no sign of luggage. Cheering from another belt as there luggage starts to after 2 hours!

2 hours and still no communication other than the local board going blank.

Rumours or another 90minute delay are spreading after a Jet2 flight luggage came through as the passengers arrived at the belt.

Manchester Airport and TUI you have a lot of very unhappy paying customers.

If I could remove the stat I would!!!

All other flights have cleared the baggage hall and still no sign of TOM791 luggage 2 hours and 15 minutes after landing

I'm giving up now 2 hours 45 minutes after we landed somebody from the airport was cornered. They were clueless and could tell anyone a thing. After calls they said they've left the place!!!",1
"Shocking, had to pay £20 at T1 short stay car park to pick up my wife. Massive congestion and confusion at arrivals Hall. All greeters were ushered out of hall to wait outside at far exit doors, arrivers were then directed to the other door further up. Should have taken 15 minutes, instead took over one hour",1
No queing sailed through customs etc. plane boarded and took off on time. A pleasant change to past trips.,5
"The airport was far too busy.
But staff were Courteous and helpful.
I would like to praise the staff on car parking. I had a flat car battery after 2 weeks hols and were parked on Jet 3. I went to barrier and spoke to a staff who said they would send a marshall and start the car, within half hour we were up and running. Thank you all involved.",3
I Recently flew out of Manchester airport and had a pleasant experience staff were amazing noticing hidden disabilities lamdyard and overall Manchester airport is by far my favourite airport in the uk as staff are so kind and helpful and by far the best experience I’ve ever had in a airport,5
"I need a wheelchair as I cannot walk long distances or stand for a long time. On both my outward and return journey through your airport, my wife and I were given a wheelchair but no member of staff to push it. This meant that my wife had to push me and all our hand luggage and later all our hold luggage.The one member of staff who did arrive on the return leg was kind and helpful  but had to deal with a passenger who had greater mobility issues than me. This was in sharp contrast to the other airports, Albuquerque and Atlanta  which we travelled through. The staff to assist were there at the door of the plane and efficiently took us to our destination. I do not understand why Manchester seems incapable of offering the same service. After sitting on the plane for an hour and a half because there was nowhere to dock  (and therefore being very anxious about missing the car we had booked for our onward journey), not having sufficient staff to provide wheelchair assistance was the last straw.
We also lost a phone and two fell-walking sticks going through security on the outward trip. We reported this and your lost property dept. claimed  that they had not appeared despite my “find my phone app.” showing  the phone’s location as Manchester Airport TERMINAL 2 for two or three days, after which the signal went dead. We will in future make every effort to avoid using this airport, although the service from Virgin Atlantic, Atlanta and Albuquerque was exemplary.",1
"This is a fiasco! We arrived more the an hour ago and until now we are still waiting for the luggage to come out at carousel number 5 of the terminal 1. As of this writing, we are still waiting! Shame on you Manchester International Airport!

Just received an update! The luggage will be available in the next 1 hour This is absolutely ridiculous!😡😡😡😡😡

Update:
It's 3.10 and we are still here waiting😡

Update:

Now they are asking us to go home because they don't have definite time when will be the luggage released!
This is beyond disgraceful!😡😡😡

3 hours of waiting here!",1
"Excellent going out oñ early flight. Terrible coming back 40 minutes passport control.
Drop off and pick up a disgrace ridiculously expensive.",3
Not dimensions for today’s traffic. Everything is narrow and you don’t have any space. For all the traveling people you should build a new terminal.,2
"Very poor show at security today. Almost as though the staff are briefed to go as slow as possible. The end of the security lanes looked for all the world like a jumble sale with people crowding the inspection area and no staff managing the process or the customers. Coming from Manchester myself it's embarrassing to think this performance is experienced by travellers from other countries. It's symptomatic of the can't be arsed attitude that permeates much of modern Britain. C- , must try harder.",2
"Fantastic speed and service on arrival, shocking security service on departure. 40+ minutes to clear security with 100s of bags getting stopped and checked manually with nothing to be found in this time.",3
"There are so many problems with Manchester Airport. I will summarise below.

Journey Out. 7th April. LS 819.
Super quick check-in by jet2. This is an airport review not airline so we'll leave that there.

Huge. Massive. Monumental queue for security. We're talking lopping around check-in area and back and forth. One and a half hours minimum.

Security was ok when you finally got there though.

I've given a whole extra star for the multiple water fill stations around the airport. That is very good.

There are also lots of toilets, but still large queues. To the point where an attendant is needed . They were 'ok' clean.

Journey Back. Thursday 14 April. LS 891.

The walk from airplane drop off to passport control is huge.

There were two travelators. both not working. No mention of this on airplane so when walking with elderly it's even farther to go than expected.

The general look of the place is going for the 'falling down next week' or 'we couldn't be bothered with this part' look.

No signage to explain why the place looks a mess or the travelators are broken. See the pics.",2
"Utter rubbish.
Management at this airport seem to be full of ideas of how to take more and more money from those using this appalling airport, but absolutely clueless in how to run it and staff it properly.
One example (of many I have), is I arrived back at Manchester yesterday (Sunday 17th Sept) and landed (after a slight delay in departure at REUS) at 11.45am.
By the time we arrived at the gate, which took nearly 10 minutes because we're at the furthest part of the 'new' T2, we had to then wait before disembarking.
Why I hear you ask.
The pilot advised us that they were waiting for someone to put 'chocks' around the wheels, and without them, the airbridge could not be attached.
The pilot said that this is the same problem that had happened earlier that morning, and had caused the delay for the plane's arrival at REUS aiport for our return journey.
It took 30 minutes before someone arrived.
We then had a 10 minute trek to get to passport control.
The 'benefit' of the new arrival gates at T2!
Btw, the 'travelators' (moving walkways) to the gate on our outbound flight the week before, weren't working.
None of them were, and not for the first time.
Through passport control and onto the
baggage reclamation carousels.
It took another 40 plus minutes before anyone from our flight, started seeing any cases.
And a quick heads up.
There's no mobile signal in this area whatsoever.
So if you're looking to tell anyone who might be collecting you that you're delayed, forget it.
And of course if they're waiting outside, they'll get whacked with those increasing charges that this useless lot
have imposed on the travelling public, for drop off/pick up.
From landing at approximately 11.45am, I finally drove away at 13.13pm.
No wonder this airport is constantly voted the worst in the UK.
People placed in top jobs, and paid ridiculous salaries, given their poor performance and abilities.
The CEO is on £2.5 million for this appalling mess.
£1 billion investment into this airport (again, they only built T2 in the late 1990's), and those that use it are definitely NOT cared for.
If you have a choice to fly from a different airport on your next trip, go there instead.",1
"Worst airport ever , my wife was in wheel chair and no one helped us at security. She had a cast on and at security they made her stand on one foot and scanned her. We went through two other airports no one did that to her. Nearly missed our flight because the security took forever . Super busy and very unorganized .",1
"What an absolute shambles at T1. It is so out of date and has definitely outgrown its passenger capacity, whatever that number is.
Ridiculous set up for bagdrop and check-in, even more ridiculous queuing system for security, at one point it seemed that I was queuing in the corridor to the basement.
Parking in T1 multistorey was ok on arrival, we parked on 8 pink, easy enough.....on return followed signs for 8 and it led me to 8 green, absolutely no signs giving directions to the different colour sections.
Why aren't to different numbers colour coordinated?
No signs from arrivals to stairways,I have elevator issues.
It is no surprise that foreign nationals are wondering around looking lost.
The whole experience has led me to decide never to fly from Manchester again.
It's an embarrassing first impression of GB.
DREADFUL.",2
"Worst airport I have ever been to.

Long queues for past port control over an hour then 10 minute walk to the pickup zone which is uncovered so you get wet when it's raining and manchester is known for the rain and then there its a £6 charge just to get picked up really disappointing everyone walking out were just upset and angry about it nothing going to change so avoid if possible",1
Horrible dirty place an embarrassment to Manchester The place is full of homeless who sleep all over the place and the airport do nothing about it The illegal immigrant hotel 100 yards away doesn’t help either The staff are ignorant arrogant and unhelpful The toilets at T1 are totally disgusting If you can from another airport then do so All the airport management is interested in is money,1
"Looks tired compared with other international airports. Poorly sign posted. Waited an absolute age for luggage to come through from the plane.
Went through T2 on our next trip, much better than the previous visit but still work to do on arrivals",4
"Can only comment on T3, but the worst airport I’ve ever experienced. Terrible layout where passengers are stopped leaving security if some of the gates are boarding. Two restaurants both of which are overcrowded and poor. Security is inefficient with curt staff. Has to be seen as comical",1
"Easy access to Manchester Airport for us from Wakefield via M62 approximately 1.5 hrs drive
We use park and ride services absolutely great service, plenty of duty free shops. Unfortunately had a delay with collecting luggage upon our return home.",5
"We have just returned from Manchester airport and got chatting to regular flyers in the many queues that we had to endure. A range of experiences:

T1 Meet & Greet - 5 star - Excellent service, easy to use and people on hand to help even in the early hours. We would definitely pay for this again.

T1 Facilities - 3 star - If you arrive early and are waiting for the bag drop to open then there is only the limited options in and around arrivals. Once through security then it's much better although it doesn't seem to rival some other UK airports.

T1 Security - 1 star - I'm glad we didn't pay extra for fast track as it funnels you into the same queue as everyone else is in. Going out, there was quite a queue and one of our bags ended up in the security check area. Because this was backed up our bag on the runners was going further back in the queue as the bags coming behind through the conveyors were placed on trolleys to clear a bottleneck, and they seemed to be prioritised. Looking over at the other security sections there were groups of staff chatting away doing very little. It took 30-40 mins after our other bags and electrical stuff had cleared, for the other bag to be examined and cleared.
Coming back wasn't great, long queues for the passport gates and then for some reason we and others were funnelled into the longest gates queue. People who had left the airplane long after us were through their gates long before us.
Security is the biggest challenge with Manchester. It always seems disorganised and there always seems to be staff on closed lines having a chat. If they are on a long break, which it didn't appear they were, then they should move to a break area.

Other more frequent flyers, didn't have anything positive to say about the Manchester airport security experience. Whilst flying back from Dalaman in Turkey, despite the extra security checks, it was far more organised and efficient.",2
"I was impressed. My flight was quite late leaving but that was not the fault of the airport. All staff were polite and there were no long lines or waits. Seating was plentiful, as were places to obtain food an drinks. Washrooms very clean. Everything was well signed and easy to navigate. All in all a pleasant experience.",4
"Worst airport ever. For the flights, they wait til10 min before boarding closes and say “last call for boarding” when they never called in the first place.

My luggage didn’t turn up on Sept 15 and I’m still waiting a week later. BA assured me it wasn’t lost but there’s a huge backlog of luggage at the moment. They’ve reached out to the airport to try to expedite my bag but no response from the duty manager at Manchester.

Additionally, I once waited 3 hours at terminal 3 to get checked in for a 30 min flight because they only had 2 ppl working the check in counters.

Abysmal.",1
Had breakfast and a beer ar the airport waiting to fly to Milan for work.   Food was OK. But slightly over cooked.,4
The security staff is very rude and aggressive. No proper sign where to go and what to after collecting boarding pass. It’s always busy and crowded all the time even in off peak time. Avoid Manchester Airport for relax travelling. Everything was okay until security check they are very rude. There was a lady in security check got Scottish accent i can’t understand it. After I am saying sorry she grabbed the basket and she also grabbed the passport I didn’t know passport  also has to go through the electronic security. Almost everyone in the security are not welcoming and they are narcissistic at base. My 12 hour long flight mood was ruined by them.,1
"Absolutely shambolic airport with security being the problem.
OK, yes I understand why we have it but 100's of passengers in terminal 2 in queues snaking around the building due to the fact that there was only 2 lanes open!
Fast pass has few passengers but 3 lanes open! Absolute farce.
Allow 1 hour at least from dropping bags to getting through security so turn up at LEAST 3 hours before your flight.",1
"Same old ..high price ,low quality,,   arrivals staff T1 refer to you as sir while rolling eyes there eyes to the world at you.... transparent and not genuine!!",1
"The pure and the worst nightmare!!!!!
Tremendously unorganized security section!!! no baby friendly space, had to wait 30mins for baby bag while little one cryed. Humiliated while seating on the floor, unbreathable areas. Only one lounge Escape was full and service only for bookings. So my Lounge Key was ridiculously useless:((( so went to the Burger King with 20metres long queue🤒. No more Manchester airport! Next time only Liverpool",1
"The airport is fine, but Tui (and more precisely their check in) are an absolute shower. 4 staff on checking paperwork with most of the check-in machines left dormant.",3
"The AirPort was clean, and staff generally friendly. Security control was a complete chaos. Be there with plenty of time. Decent shopping and nice restaurants.",3
"The airport in general was good. Smooth check in and departure, smooth arrival passport control and bag collection. However on both visits the toilets in Terminal 3 were disgusting. I understand this is caused by the general public but the airport should be monitoring and cleaning more regularly. Basic hygiene is so important particularly when travelling.",3
"This was my first experience at Manchester Airport. I used Terminal 2. Clean, spacious place. There are muti-faith praying rooms before and after the check points. Huge Duty free area, various shops, helpful staff. Walking takes too long from train station to Terminal 2.",5
security queues are too long. it takes ages. I know they are doing a good job but i'm sure there must be a faster way to do it. Internet WI-FI  very slow.,3
Only 25 minutes from baggage drop to airside!,4
I don't know why they charge for dropping off and picking up if they want people to use the airport then make it free,4
Drop off and pick-up from T1 - short stay is a better option that the drop-off/pickup.,4
"Sat on a plane for 3 hrs they said it was the weather but we heard the staff saying a pilot hadn't arrived,  lies lies lies then they came with a cup of water joke",1
"In fairness, Terminal 2 is quite nice and modern. I departed from there with TUI and had a pleasant experience. The ability to check in your cases the evening before is also a nice time saver.  Security was thorough but smooth when I passed through, although I could see how it could become hectic at peak times. I was quite worried about getting through in time as, this being England, several trains to the airport that morning were cancelled at the last minute and I arrived late.

Terminal 3, however, is a shameful excuse for an airport. I landed here from a 3rd world country but Manchester was chaotic in comparison. Firstly, we had to wait an hour on the tarmac for a bus to arrive. You're then channeled into a glorified cow shed of a building. Connecting flights aren't supported airside as they would be in any decent airport. You have to exit though immigration before re-entering through security. Those who have to change terminals will have to walk for about 20 minutes through a connecting corridor. Naturally enough, the people movers in this tunnel don't work. Indeed, I didn't see a single escalator or people mover in service throughout the entire airport.

As per most UK airports, security is a shambles in T3. All individual cables/electronics have to be removed from your bag and you're told that any issue with your bag will lead to an hour's delay. Based on the queues, I'd well believe that. Totally incompetent and over zealous staff.

The departures lounge itself reminds me of a regional airport. It is in no way suitable for the quantity of passengers that use it, and there are queues everywhere. Indeed, the narrow corridor that leads to the shops is actually bisected by a boarding gate. We had to wait for a flight to board so that we could actually pass into the terminal proper. Laughable stuff. You would really wonder who designed this kip.",2
"Better than expected ,no problem ,we where informed when are flight was late every one was very polite ,a good start to our holiday",4
Rip offs making people pay to get picked up which can take all of 30 secs you'd think the people who run/own the airport would recognise this.,1
"The T1 infrastructure is poorly designed and outdated. The security checkpoint experience raver chaotic; there was what seemed to be a very high rate of additional hand luggage checks causing congestion in the area; many passengers just walked off ignorantly, not returning their tray and causing the conveyor to stop.",2
bus station train station all public transport connects with the airport.some nice hotels also around the airport also some great bargains in the duty free,5
"It's one of the worst airports I've ever been to. It's always chaos to be fair. If you have to fly i recommend you to go in advance. The queues for the security check are horrendous, there are endless, the fast track is a trap, you will queue as the rest of the mortals. The situation on the site is not the best one. UK government should invest more money in the airport of the second city of the UK.
After going a couple of times, the airport has improved nothing out of this world but helps to make the experience much better",2
"Manchester Airport never fails to disappoint! We only used Manchester as the flights booked from Liverpool were changed significantly leaving only suitable flights from Manchester. Departure was actually relatively ok - arrival was awful! We landed at 19:17 and then waited on the plane for about 20 minutes until the bridge was set up... a further 2 hours later we were still waiting for our luggage. What really galls is the total lack of information given. No staff to be seen, no announcements! No customer care at all! Initially there were 3 flights detailed on the screen.. then the Bergamot flight went off, and then luggage started coming up for the flight that landed nearly 1 hour AFTER ours from Madrid...  Eventually our flight details went off the carousel screen... everyone started checking the other belts but all screens blank. Finally cases started coming up on the original carousel.. we left the airport at 21:32.. £20 lighter with car park fees!! I accept that ground crew are recruited by the airlines, however the passengers are passing through YOUR airport MAG! You could show some interest",2
"The facilities in terminal 2 just seem too few for the number of people travelling at peak times. We arrived about 3 hours before our flight, we had dropped bags the day before so headed straight through security. 3 bars all absolutely rammed with queues a mile long outside. We waited an hour to get a table in one, the poor lady managing the tables was excellent but the crowds just outnumbered the space available. Restaurants were all crowded as well. The baggage drop and check in area is huge but past security is comparatively small and it just couldn't cope with the crowds when we were there. On the plus side the security queues were quick and the staff we encountered were friendly.",2
Still the worst airport I have ever been to.  It's only standout feature is that it so consistently rubbish.,1
"This airport is old, dirty and has broken operations (clarification we travelled through T1). Plan sufficient time to travel from this airport. Terrible experience overall.

We travelled to MAN this weekend with a 3 month old baby. Quite a few things went wrong for us:
1) inbound flight - airport staff didn’t deliver our stroller at the plane, despite having a “gate delivery” tag on it. We were advised that it would be delivered at baggage claim instead. And this was the same for every stroller in our flight. We had to carry suitcases and the baby through the airport and border control. Unpleasant experience.
2) car rental return: the car rental parking is far from terminal and requires 30-40 mins extra in planning
3) check in staff was rude
4) Outbound flight: as we were travelling with a baby, and we were directed to the security lane for people that require assistance. There, there were 3 agents processing one person at the time. 10 persons in front of us, 25 mins to go through security. Abnormally slow. Luckily, by then, our flight was delayed (we would have otherwise missed it).
5) Cherry on the cake: we had checked a baby bed. On our arrival at destination, we found out that it was never loaded on our flight, and thus lost. 24h later, it has now been located and will be delivered with 3 days delay minimum.

In short, we will NEVER travel through Manchester again.",1
"I've flown through this airport twice in the last week. It is a disaster! They say they're remodeling. They need to burn it down and start from scratch. It's not just the remodeling that needs to be done. They're security is for the birds. They have such low quality machines that every other bin of sweaters and bags gets rejected so an individual has to review your whole bag with you. This line can be 20 people deep as you're waiting for one person to go through each bin and tell you your bag actually was fine in the first place. We watched as they pulled bags from stewards and pilots. Seriously, these people know the regulations for going through security. They still were opening their bags and checking everything. The signage is terrible. You don't know where you're going half the time. They keep ushering you through shopping areas as you search for the correct sign to figure out where you're supposed to be heading. The shopping areas are beautiful apparently making money is the only desire of this airport. Customer satisfaction is not something they're striving for at all!
I could go on about the ground crew that left us sitting on the plane for 2 and 1/2 hours because they wouldn't usher a plane onto the tarmac or the lack of communication when your flight eventually gets canceled because you sat waiting on the plane too long. There are so many other things that I don't even have time to put in this review.
Lastly, it's filthy (except shopping areas), I've seen one cleaning person in the whole airport and I've been here for hours. It's a shame. Avoid it at all costs!",1
"Bag collection smelt like Fish and PISS deffo made me more ill.
So messy, dirty and awkward to navigate even after 18 years. Worst it’s ever been despite some new additions to T2, there’s no excuse for the poor hygiene and terrible management. Waited for bags for 1.5 hours only getting them when we told a nice member of staff to run behind and tell them to get to work. Security is abit pushy as always but it’s the least of the issues… as in, the cleaner could barely move at all and just sat in the musty seats around the bag collection. Ugh…",1
"I though it would be bigger but its basically a few little airports put together. Space is scarce and we struggled to find a place to sit. Queues were quite quick but I dont understand why you need to use the self-checking and thrn queue again to hand out your luggage. The best part was the parking in T3, super easy, friendly staff and a breeze to use.",3
"Can’t believe how bad this place is compared to what it used to be like. Cramped and dark and in desperate need of a good clean would be my rating. This airport used to be light and airy with high ceilings and open concourses now it’s dingy and crammed.
Who ever runs it needs to walk it as a customer security is exceptionally poor and compared to world class airports it’s simply miles off.",2
"Horrible experience. Lost bag on a late flight, no baggage desk, only a courtesy phone which, of course, no one answers. Next day 3 hours calling the number, no answer. Avoid at all cost.",1
Missed our flight due to staff taking forever. However they did try their best to sort it out.,3
Terrible place. You’re better off walking than waiting the amount of time the rental car village buses take to arrive.,1
"Security very fast and very polite operatives. Clean and tidy, a bit warm for me especially coming in from cold temperatures.",4
"Airport staff where polite and helpful going through security in T3. But once you are in the departure area, there are only a couple of places to eat. It’s always crowded and difficult to find a seat. The small coffee bars also shut on Saturday evening around 19.30.",3
Flight to Lanzarote delayed one hour on Jet2 flight because they loaded the plane with the wrong luggage. On the plane for 5 1/2 hours. Not good 👎,1
"Good smaller airport (am used to Heathrow/Gatwick) lots of shops and places to sit. WiFi was good and it looked nice and clean.

However, we struggled to find somewhere to fill up our water bottles before we got to our gate.",4
Easy reach by train. Pretty good stores. Bit far walk between terminals.,3
"Arrived at 3.50am for a 7.10am flight the picture was the queue to the checkin desk to find out I was checking myself in, some members of staff not helping passengers absolutely horrendous. Almost 2 and a half hours to get through checkin and security and now it's 7.30am and we're sat on the tarmac 😡🤬",2
"Not long in the security clearance, then through to departure, Easyjet staff very nice and helpful.",4
Fix the travelators to & from station and to departure gates multiple dates completely switched off,1
"Without doubt the worst airport I’ve ever been too. Rude staff, pushy, lack of signage's for where to go and what you are required to do. Border force requirement’s different, got pulled up for Ventolin puffy but no sign saying take out of bag, nobody telling you this is required to be in plastic. Absolute disgraceful the way passengers were being spoken at. We are all told to respect workers, as we should but how about respecting the public!",1
"I hate this airport. Returned late last night from Bulgaria. No steps for the aircraft so stuck on there for 30 minutes. Then only one bus so stuck on the aircraft again, Then complete chaos at arrivals. Everyone directed to the massive queue for egates at passport control despite there being a line of manned booths with officers looking bored and having nothing to do.  Traffic gridlock which the airport's own buses were stuck in. 30 minutes wait for a car park bus, a crowd almost fighting to get on it. Lots left behind. Then 30 minutes in traffic to go the mile to the Drop and Go car park.  Cars driving through red lights, blocking box junctions, honking horns everywhere - at 4am! Ignoring the astronomical charges for every little thing, Manchester airport manages to be the ultimate combination of rip-off and dysfunctional.",1
"Hmm.

**Edited**

Hard to rate this airport. Compared to what?

Compared to Leeds Bradford-its a flipping Palace!

Compared to Gatwick or Heathrow? Yeah, not even close. Like not even on the same scale.

It's hard to get to. The layout is illogical and poorly thought out causing bottlenecks of traffic ALL the time.

They are a whole new level of money grabbing. You have to pay to drop off, pay to pick up, and for increments of 5 minutes. Literally no way of getting here without a hefty charge.

It's incredibly ugly. Looks like a heap of buildings were dropped randomly out of the sky. Certain parts of the inside are looking smarter.

Parking? They think they are in London. It's Manchester, get a grip on yourselves.

Once you're through to the departure lounge it looks quite smart. Until multiple flights are due. It simply cannot cope with any sort of rush. All the bars and restaurants immediately fill and have queues, and in fact this happens so often they have queue systems permanently set up. If you know its going to happen then expand? Or am I niave?

On my last two trips I was lucky enough to hit a lull and saw a different side of the airport. A nice range of shops with a good range of products available to use up some waiting time.
There is a lot of seating but still not enough for the volume of travellers which is why I think travellers move to random gates to sit in peace.

The Premier lounges are not premier at all. I assume there is another level of them for genuinely rich people as I would be annoyed if I were a millionaire and dumped in a 'premier' lounge lounge with kids running up and down, people yelling into their phones, one toilet per hundred etc. Separate review.

I'd rather travel and go from a London airport. Manchester should take an hour but is so poorly accessed takes 2 minimum from my house. Heathrow is 4. Maybe I should swap.

These last two time I parked in a jet park and took a shuttle bus to the terminals. Wow, what a difference. The car parks are way cheaper and easier to access and the shuttles comes every 15 or so. Short ride around the circuit and deliver you to the front door. This is how I'm going to do it from now on.

Still better than Leeds Bradford airport though.",4
"We got there at 5:30. Departure hall eas busy but I've never seen the security queue so small. Well worth getting up early, as it cam be extremely busy. Shops, restaurants where busy but fine. Lots of places to sit. Made for a relaxing boarding.",4
"Not a bad airport. But honestly, just looks a bit shabby. Overgrown, unkempt. Litter outside. Unfortunately, just looks and feels a bit worn out! But I guess it does the job!",4
Harder to get around and make connections than other airports. Staff were generally pretty helpful. Alot of rubbish and food scraps on the ground in the Lounges. Could do with some upgraded Infrastructure especially at terminal 1 to save this catching a shuttle bus across the tarmac  to your plane.,3
"A literal hellscape. Amongst loads of other issues, we arrived 2 hours and 15 minutes before our flight and still almost missed it because the check in queue was 45 minutes long and the security queue was an hour long.

On the way back the airport was so overloaded that multiple flights were sharing baggage conveyors and the reclaim hall was like waterloo station, so so busy and dangerous. We then couldn't get a taxi for 90 minutes and ended up having to brave an hour long tram journey through a really unsafe and scary line.

My last time using the airport before this was pre-covid and I've never really had an issue, but it's obvious now that they've cut too many staff and amenities to deal with the capacity. I can't recommend enough that you travel to and from an alternative airport if you can.",1
Great  experience  terminal 2 escape  lounge  amazing  and all went well on time etc 😀,5
"Probably one of the worst airport experience I ever had. Shameful for the UK aviation.

No clear signs.
Rules made up at the check in desk, every time there is different one.
Security is probably the worst. The scanners they have are probably old or useful, every single bag had to be checked several times, we spent 1 hour just at the security.

Lastly, you literally have to pay even for the air you breathe.

Never again I'll use MAN airport.",1
"Very expensive for any kind of parking. Insultingly high drop off charges.
The security procedure and staff are marginally more polite and efficient than those at Birmingham who must have been hand picked for their lack of manners and grace.
The airport itself is relatively clean and user friendly but the holiday definitely doesn't start in the airport.
Nothing special about it.",3
"Arrived at airport from sharm, went to check in desk and was asked to remove my passport holder which I did. I was then having a conversation with my son and the passport control officer then turned to me asking if I had a problem. I was shocked as was not sure what he was on about and said no to which he then started ranting at me and my family and threatening to search all our luggage. I could not believe this man’s attitude just because I was taking to my son. This man was on a power trip and made me and my family very uncomfortable. Would not use this airport again after this experience as never have I felt so disrespected for no reason",1
"Got through security OK. Staff friendly and efficient, but needed to have more staff on the move the queue fasted. Terminal 3 air side is OK, some shops but fairly limited. Quite area to sit on Level 2 if you need to get away from the madding crowd.",4
We ran for 2 km last week to get a flight because we were on terminal 1 instead terminal 3. On top of that all fast lanes are closed and kind of renovation is applied to this airport.Nobody send any email to us which terminal should be used.Absolutely no organisation on airport. Nobody will to help you. The airport need to be closed temporary. Maybe army can manage this disaster. You have big chance if you first time you won't fly because you are too late and because you do not know where you should be. Not recommended to fly from Manchester. Person accountable for this mess should be arrested by police. The place is not safe. People run all over to get the flight. Queues all over. Avoid.,1
Quite literally the worst organized airport in Europe.Prepare to wait for 3 hours before getting to your gate.,1
"2023:
Honestly, where do I begin..  The airport is understaffed, which caused us to be stuck in our plane while we waited for the ok to depart for over 15 minutes.  The stairs off of the plane felt rickety and sketchy.  The one good thing is that customs went by smoothly.

2024: the airport was really smooth. A VERY great improvement! I went through border control in less than 5 minutes.",3
"So there's nothing essentially wrong with this airport. You have to queue for check in and security, but that's expected (although I wish it wasn't). It's fine inside, in a slightly run-down sort of way.

But, being an airport, almost everything's a rip-off. Just bring a water bottle and fill it up for free from the water stations. And if you need to eat, bring something in with you. Be prepared to queue for everything, and you'll survive!",3
"I thought Birmingham airport was bad, well done Manchester you were even worse. Security was a joke, really reminded me of my first time in Africa 30 years ago They were checking every bag for a bomb when it was obvious that the majority of people going on holiday could not spell bomb.The price of everything was ridiculous. Even worse was car hire which I was told was in the airport. Well, it sort of is in the airport in a place called car rental village, so you need to take a bus which stops at the other terminals first. Badly organised, poor quality staff, dirty, noisy. I will give it one star but it does not really deserve it.",1
Probably the worst airport of this size I have ever used. The lines at security are always lengthy due to lack of staff.,1
"The worst airport I have ever been. The worst service and they don’t think about people with kids.
They don’t bring the strollers to airplane door and expect us to go that 10min walk with our kids. I travel alone with my kids. One of them is 6 months other is 2.5 years. I had to carry my baby all the way with my bags and force my toddler to walk with his small legs. Also, waited 1.5 hours for the luggages. What do employees do in 1.5 hours after the landing? What takes that long? If you are lack of emloyees hire some!!

Huge dissapointment and a very bad experience!!",1
"Got to be the worst airport in the world, fly regularly and never had so many problems from check in, to security, to lounges being full, food courts being full. Toilets are disgusting the only reason I fly from here is because I have no other choice.",1
"If I could give no stars I would. Just got back from New York - our Aer Lingus plane landed and we were sat on the runway waiting to park for an hour!! Apparently this is quite common.  Then you go through border control tired and exhausted and get shouted at because their signage is confusing.  We’re a family of 3 with a 13 year old daughter (who looks 16) and got barked at to use the lane for families with children under 10. The other Lane was for everyone else.  The women barking her orders just shouted ‘babies, babies!!’ behind our backs and nobody knew who she was referring to (shouting at us to use the families with kids under 10).  Now we’re waiting at the baggage carousel and no luggage!  So much for sustainability/net zero/carbon neutral.  Wasted jet fuel sitting on a runway for an hour and we’ve been watching an empty carousel go round for 30 minutes!  What a waste of resources.  Just been on holiday to the US where they know how to treat people.  Welcome back to the UK!",1
"The Terminals drop off and pick ups are very complicated, making people go round in circles.
Also parking charges are extremely high, not fair for just short drops 😞",3
"Easy through with hand luggage cleared security in ten mins queues for hold luggage were long,prices weren't bad for coffee etc depends which franchise you use",4
"Terminal 3 has to be the,worst no smoking room at all very limited  shops will try to avoid it again to be honest not impressed at all and yo make matters worse my flight was delayed grrrrragain delayed from Heathrow and slow with the baggage at terminal 1 today yes can smoke",2
"No worse generally than other large airports. Once through security in T2 the toilets were just adequate in size (3 urinals & 2 cubicles) on a February Saturday, but seem too small for really busy times. As usual, too much space given to selling stuff and not enough to the comfort of travellers.",3
"Worst airport I have ever travelled to.
They charge you for everything and provide the lowest customer service possible.
Queue are frequent and you need to get there 4 hours ahead of your flight if you want to make it on time!
Nightmare",1
"Horrible experience. Poor signage from the train station to terminal 3. Security area crowded and poorly organised, with long queues, staff shouting at you, and irritating, repetitive announcements on the speakers. Also a confusing array of signs and videos in the security queue, all giving slightly different instructions.",1
"Had a connecting flight here from Dublin, no way to put my sealed bottle of unopened  Jameson in my luggage from my carry on, because it was already on the way to the plane , so they Confiscated it. Told me I can mail it to myself for £30. Gave me a form that took me to a website that doesn’t mail to the U.S., then when entering  their terminal there’s bottles of liquor everywhere for sale that I can take on the plane. Also witnessed them confiscating bottles that were in duty free bags. Then once we were told where are gate would be 30mins before takeoff we had to go back through security, with only benches blocking us from where they search. They should take notes from Dublin and JFK and not steal peoples goods. Place is a disorganized mess.",1
"Manchester airport strikes again! We arrived at 4am for a flight at 7am. We were on time and very well prepared. Another passenger did not turn up for the flight and it took 45mins to retrieve their bag? How can your staff not know where they stored a bag for 45mins? This delay caused us to miss our connection flight at Heathrow and got us stranded for 10 hours, costing us a day of our holiday and lots of stress and anxiety. This was entirely down to the management of the airport and a lack of competency when dealing with standard airport problems. If possible avoid using this airport for connection flights.",1
"Security is unorganised, which is actually the longest time you are in the airport. It took 2 hours to get through today, 13 August, and we were in the Assistance Lane. Poor organisation. Plus, visit to escape longe. Really busy, noisy, and limited food options: chicken wings, pasta, sausage, and bacon for warm food. No deserts, as well as a queue at the bar for drinks. Bit of a joke, really, as it's supposed to be the ""escape"" lounge. Won't return. Basically, it is a smaller terminal building with free limited choice food and drink. Shocking.",3
Will NEVER fly from Manchester Airport again. Flew to Feuturventura 30/09/23. Checked in on line but on arrival @ self check in the queues were horrendous due to the extremely appalling system in place for herding us in no particular order to check luggage in. By the time we had finished with that debacle we had no time to get anything to eat or drink despite getting to the airport 3 hours before flying. Such a joke & the management team should be ashamed & appalled at themselves for their exceptionally poor management planning & skills.,1
"Departure was not great as only one desk was working for baggage drop, thankfully had checked-in online previously. Coming back, much more organised. From wheels down to disembarking, through passport control, baggage reclaim and to taxi rank in 38 minutes.",4
Terminal 1 security was quick and easy to get through at the start of half-term. No stress.,5
Terminal 2 is mint and clean easy to navigate super great staffing polite and friendly. Only down side is at 9pm everywhere shuts no food or drink available for a late flight!,4
"Terrible a nightmare.
My Grandson is a type 1 Diabetic, he was carrying a doctors letter explaining that he had to carry sugary drinks and food with him constantly.
Despite this and the fact that his sugar's where low they kept him at security for around half an hour causing him to get stressed and upset has everyone in our party had passed through.
I'm the end they decided to bin his three lucozade drinks and let him through.
We had to then rush to get him a sugar drink has his G6 was alerting us to low blood sugar.
It has caused him and us to feel like it was discrimination against his disability and we will be making a formal complaint.
It simply is not on to upset a child because of a disability especially has he was carrying a doctors letter explanation.
Disgusting and I will never use this airport again Liverpool for me.

Date of experience: 15 September 2023",1
"Diabolical, getting through customs taking the best part of two hours, got there 3 hours before flight and they had to re open the gate,absolute joke, will be recommending through social media to avoid this cattle market at all costs.",1
"Useless fast track, no information after the security gates. You end up at Gate 37/38 and you still don’t know where to go 😂",1
"Picking up and dropping off is a nightmare. Even with the new systems, there's still only one lane to get into pickup parking at T1, and there are long queues from the main roundabout",3
"I've been to a lot of airports around the world and this is easily the worst. Empty dirty glasses under every bench and bin. Puddles of spilt booze and sticky drinks. Over an hour before even a caution sign was set up over the mess, no one mopping or sweeping anything. I read a review describing this as 'the 80s bus station of international airports' but it's more like a house party when then lights go on, complete with all the toilet bowls being blocked and the urinals had hairs and yellow encrusted matter gathering around it's lip. The place stinks, I assume it's a problem with the ventilators, quite often I walked into a unshifting wall of fart. Some of the staff are really nice and I feel sorry for them as they see us seeing their colleagues milling around in groups doing nothing and unaware of the rubbish stuck to their shoes. This place is a dump.",1
"£5 to drive through a barrier, drop somebody off and then drive back out. Maximum of 60 seconds. Daylight robbery!",1
"An absolute dump of an airport, well up there with some of the very worst in the modern world. From bathroom facilities that resemble an old service station; doors off hinges, seats that don't fit and a permanent stink.. to the 'we only care about rinsing you of what money you have' shopping experience which pushes you ever further from an actual gate, instead you're fed through an IKEA style forced pathway of career limited desperately hawking overpriced smelly water and chocolates 3 x the price of the nearest shop.

Let's not forget the total ROBBERY of a parking experience.  Literally ANY airport other than this tip",1
"No place to eat breakfast food all day.
The restaurants were very slow.
There was no place to buy traditional foods to take home like: cheeses, scones, clotted cream, nice jams, marmalades ...... shame",3
